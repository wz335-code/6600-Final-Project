This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for several years.

Hard Work
This exciting story is Joanna Jones's twentieth.

Hospital or Cinema?
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year.

1,"BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.,say the police.
Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window.
He went on to report that night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work.
Inspector Saunders said that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.'",A2,,,,,,
2,"Madame Tussaud's

One very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Here people can see figures of famous people made of wax.
Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, a doctor, made wax figures of people. He opened a museum of these figures in Paris. Marie helped him in his work.
In 1789,during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. Here she had to copy the heads of famous people when they were dead, including Queen Marie Antoinette's.
In 1795,Marie married Francois Tussaud and in 1802 she came to London with her wax figures. Here she opened a museum and her figures can still be seen today.",A2,,,,,,

4,"CANADA GEESE

Canada Geese are large blue and white birds. When autumn arrives, they have to fly south where the weather is warmer. The winters are so cold in Canada that the birds die if they stay there.
Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, 'These young birds won't know what to do in the autumn.'
Bill had a small plane and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All through the summer, he went on short trips in his plane and the young geese flew after him.
When the cold weather arrived in autumn, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. Bill left the geese in Virginia and he returned home.
This spring, Bill was waiting for the birds to come back. They didn't arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to get them. He looked for them for two weeks but he couldn't find them.
When he arrived back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him!",A2,,,,,,
5,"BICYCLES 

The bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about one hundred and fifty years ago. 
At first bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could buy one. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we have today. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought one. People started riding bicycles to work and in their free time. 
Today, people use cars more than bicycles; cars are much faster and you don't get wet when it rains! But some people still prefer to cycle to work. They say that there are too many cars in town centres and you can't find anywhere to park!

I read your advertisement for English courses in the newspaper. I would like to have some more information. How much does a course cost? Also, how long is each course and when does the next course start?
Yours, 
Maria Gonzalez 
 

Dear Ms. Gonzalez, 
Thank you for your letter. Our next course starts in three weeks, on Monday, 9 May. This is a 6-week course and it costs PS150. If you prefer to begin in June, we have another 10-week course for PS200. I hope that is the information you want.

7,"ESTHER'S STORY

When Esther left school at the age of sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her PS500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends decided to go to college, but Esther used her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar and some glass jars and began making her own jam. She sold the jam for PS1 a jar to her friends and she soon doubled her aunt's PS500.
At first, her parents didn't want Esther to spend her time making jam and they thought that she should study instead. They hoped that one day she would be a teacher or a doctor. But Esther didn't listen to them. She just kept on making jam. After a few months, she started selling it to the local market. Then she started making orange juice. She sold this to a school where one of her friends worked.
After two years, her business was very large and her parents were very pleased with her. She made all kinds of food which she sold to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to get some people to work for her. ",A2,,,,,,
8,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL 

In 1783, two French brothers built the first balloon to take people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew in it. This was in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office began the first airmail service. 
Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. Then, in the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. 
In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and it can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the journey from London to New York is only four hours.
Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is difficult to think of a world without them.

10,"REBECCCA STEVENS

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she went up the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London.
In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. 'You must carry everything on your back,' she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!'
When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly she became famous.
Now she has written a book about the trip and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science programme on television.
Rebecca is well known today and she has more money, but she still lives in the little flat in south London among her pictures and books about mountains!",A2,,,,,,
11,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dog.
The two smaller sizes first came to England over 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer has not been here very long. The name Giant is a good one because the dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm high.
All the dogs have long hair, which should be cut quite often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey in colour, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black.
Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use the dogs to help them with their sheep, and they are also used by the police, because Schnauzer dogs are very intelligent.
A Schnauzer makes a nice family dog. It is friendly and very good with young children.",A2,,,,,,
12,"THE OSTRICH 

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can be more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few of them left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour, so it is very difficult for other animals to catch them. 
Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.

14,"WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE

Nicola Peet left school at eighteen, went to college and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she went to work for Saudi Arabian Airlines and then she joined British Airways as an air hostess. Four years later, she got her present job as a manager.
This is what she told us about her job:
'My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time in the air. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems. I also go to lots of meetings.
My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses.
Sometimes I go on long flights to check how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favourite part of the job, but I like office work, too. Travelling can be hard work. When I get back from a long journey, all I can do is eat something and then go to bed! I don't earn much money, but I'm happy with British Airways and want to stay there and continue to travel.'",A2,,,,,,
15,"The Ruwenzori Mountains 

Mary Daniels is a student in England. This year she had a very interesting summer holiday. She travelled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns. 'It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where we could buy food,' said Mary. 'It was also very cold and wet in the mountains. It is one of the wettest places in the world.' 
Mary stayed in the mountains for six weeks. It was hard work, but she says it was the best thing she has ever done. She is hoping to return next year to do some more work there.

16,"Dear Mike, 
I am sorry you could not come to my party yesterday. Jon told me you had a very bad cold and you decided to stay in bed. Are you feeling better now?

17,"HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a beautiful village about fifty kilometres west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old.
When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty!
So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do? He says it's expensive to start your own restaurant and it's much more difficult to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he's sure he's done the right thing.",A2,,,,,,
18,"Line dancing 

Thousands of people in Britain have a new hobby -- line dancing. In almost every town, you will find clubs and classes for this new activity. 
'Line dancing is easy to learn. If you have two feet and can walk, then you can do it!' Fiona Lever, a teacher, says. 'You don't need a partner because you dance in groups. It's the best way to make new friends. In my classes, there are young and old people. The boys like it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet during the dances!' 
When did line dancing begin? Most people think it started about fifteen years ago when American country music became famous in Britain.

I'm writing to say thank you for the two nights I stayed in

20,"Bill Prince-Smith

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer and a teacher and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes into his office and writes. In the evening, he gives the work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live near here but they also read my stories and say if they are good or bad.' And so Bill has learned what young children want to read.
Bill writes about the life in his village and on the farms near it. His fifth book is his favourite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and the dog that helps him.
'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are so clever, they learn very quickly.'
Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used the latest computer technology to make people think that the animals are speaking. Bill was very pleased with the film. 'Sometimes film- makers change books, but they didn't change mine and I love the film.'",A2,,,,,,
21,"Otters 

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and
make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their
homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 
10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. 
Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was so dirty that many fish and insects died and the otters couldn't find anything to eat. But today there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

24,"HOW DO THE IRISH POP-GROUP 'BOYZONE' LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE?

Sleeping well is very important. When I can get home to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. But I find it very difficult to sleep at night after a concert because my head is full of music.
Sport is important. Before I had a car accident I was at the sports centre two and a half hours a day, five days a week. I can't do that now so I do about 150 sit-ups a day.
I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat well. Also I drink a lot of water because it's good for your health. I should have about eight glasses a day but I don't always drink so much.
People shouldn't work all the time. I love my job but there are other things I like doing too. In my free time I just listen to music or watch TV. It's good for you to do nothing sometimes.
I don't get tired any more since the doctor told me to eat better. Now I eat lots of things like carrots and spinach every day. But I still eat burgers sometimes!",A2,,,,,,
25,"The Cerne Giant 

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are quite near each other. On the road between them, there are a lot of green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to 
him is called Cerne.
Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think that it was a very long time ago. To get nearer the picture, you can walk from 
Cerne. If you go on the first of May when the sun comes up, you will see all the people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.

27,"John Pickering

In a park in a small town in central England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers. But all last week he was in Tokyo and millions of Japanese people watched the thirty-five-year-old gardener on television because John is the number one singer in Japan at the moment. John visited Japan a few months ago to sing in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on his radio show. Hundreds of young people phoned the radio and asked the disc jockey to play the songs once more.
John, who uses the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, is not going to stop working in the park in England. He does not know yet how much he will earn from his music. 'I must keep my job in the park,' he says. 'I still have to pay my bills!' The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan. They've never even heard him sing.
John's wife, Denise, a hospital worker, says, 'This will not change the way we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!'",A2,,,,,,
28,"POSTCARDS 

Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. 
Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit. People liked to see them because they did not have pictures in their newspapers then.

I was born in the United States but I have written several travel books about England. I lived there with my wife and four children for 20 years, but for the last three years we have lived in the United States. Our children are now learning about life in the United States. I'm sure they will be happier because they have lived in two countries. I like Britain and I want to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is going to start college here soon, so it won't be for another four years.
I have just been to England for six weeks to work on a radio programme about the English language and also to talk about the book I've just written. Most writers don't like doing this; they don't like travelling around the country, selling their book. I don't mind it. I like visiting new places and meeting lots of people. It's very different from the life I have in the United States when I'm writing. In England, people drove me around in big cars and I stayed in expensive hotels. It was good because I didn't have to pay any bills. Everyone was kind to me and it was fun.",A2,,,,,,
31,"CROCODILES 

We can find crocodiles in tropical parts of the world, for example Africa, South America and Northern Australia. 
They spend most of the time in slow-moving water but they can move fast through the water and on land. 
You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch, like fish, birds and small animals. And sometimes they make a meal of large animals or even people. 
There are more than ten types of crocodile. They all have very sharp teeth. They often lose these teeth, but soon get new ones. 
Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 metres long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles live for a long time. The oldest one kept in a zoo was 66 years old.

33,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much.
About 300 years ago, London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible.
In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street.
Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men.
Today, London police are quite well paid and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.",A2,,,,,,
34,"Snowboarding

Victoria Jamieson from Britain started snowboarding at 20. She is now 23 and has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her when she was at a snowboarding competition last week in Switzerland and asked her why she started the sport.
'I've always liked all kinds of sports, especially skiing, and it seemed natural to start snowboarding. It doesn't take long to learn and you can become really good in a few months.'
We asked her if she had to do a lot of practice. 'Well, in winter I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8.30 a.m. until 4 p.m. I also run and go biking. But I just love doing it all! I like the competitions and being in the mountains. It's so beautiful. But free-riding, that's doing what you want when you're not in a competition, is the best thing in the world for me.'
We asked her what is important when you're learning. 'You can learn quickly but you need lessons. It's also important to have the right clothes so you don't get wet because, to begin with, you spend a lot of time falling down!'",A2,,,,,,
35,"BEARS

The bear can be a dangerous animal. The adult bear is very strong and it can kill a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and they can run very fast. But they cannot see well and, like most animals, they find food by using their noses.
There are seven kinds of bear: The largest is the white polar bear, which is almost three metres tall. There are two kinds of black bear: One lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. But not all black bears are black. They may be dark brown or a reddish brown.
Everyone loves the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is difficult to find food.",A2,,,,,,

37,"ICE-FISHING

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice.
Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish. is easy,' he says. 'First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack! Today I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport and you can meet some nice people here!'",A2,,,,,,
38,"The History of Farming 

Before people started farming, they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and slowly their villages got bigger. 
Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and then some people did not get enough food to eat. 
Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.

40,"Corryvale Farm

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep.
She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts this wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash.
That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present. On the walls of Jenny's office, there are lots of letters from happy customers all over the world.",A2,,,,,,
41,"The Globe Theatre 

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round, there was no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen loved going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to see the plays of William Shakespeare. All the actors at that time were men. The visitors ate, talked to their friends, walked about during the show, and some people even threw things at the actors! 
Today, it is still possible to visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre stands in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or just learn about life in the seventeenth century.

42,"Dear Jeff, 
I'm having a good holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago the weather was bad and it was cold. Now the weather is better and we go to the beach every day. 
This week we are staying in Sydney but next week we went to the Great Barrier Reef. Because the water was so warm, I loved swimming there. The fish were all different here: red, yellow, purple! Australia is very beautiful. We don't want to come home! 
See you at the end of September.

43,"A great idea!

Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys who grew up in the same small Canadian town.
They have always been friends and classmates. Like all their other friends, they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months, they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because they have a lot of homework. They have made a new computer word game.
The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin, who had problems with his reading. Kevin learns words more easily by seeing pictures and hearing information than he does by reading. His brother wanted to help. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make a computer game and now it's ready to use. It's a speaking and picture game. For example, if you look at the word 'hat', there's a drawing of a hat next to it and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time.
The two boys have won a lot of prizes for their computer game and it will soon be on sale around the world. Many schools are interested in buying it.",A2,,,,,,
44,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died.
The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds.
Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. Also it could run fast because it had long back legs.",A2,,,,,,
45,"Parrots 

Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds, with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil, Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit, they are sometimes a problem for farmers. 
There are many different kinds of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet, which they use for climbing and holding food. The biggest birds can live for up to 80 years. 
They are very noisy, but they are clever birds and it is easy to teach them to talk. Some zoos have parrot shows, where you can see the birds doing things they have learned.

Hi Anna,
I'm not having a very good week!
Yesterday my team had a volleyball match, but we lost. The other team played much better than we did! Then my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, telephoned with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he's got a summer job. We can't go camping together now. And this morning, my sister got up late so she rode my bike to school! She didn't tell me she needed to use it. I'm really angry with her. 
I hope you have some good news! Write back today if you can.

Ivan Petrov
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia, but from the age of twelve to eighteen he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. At ten, he decided that he wanted to write music too, and he soon started on his first song.
Oleg Gagarin
Oleg was the youngest of five children and when he was four years old his father, who liked playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. When he was six, he started having lessons with a piano teacher who lived in the same city. Oleg soon began to win prizes for his piano playing. At the age of fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Later, he returned home to Russia.
Josef Heptmann
Josef's father was German but he taught music in Poland where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and a year later he started playing the piano.
He gave his first concert when he was six. At ten, he gave fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef always liked music but he was also interested in physics and languages. He is too busy now but one day he would like to write his own music.",A2,,,,,,
48,"The history of horse racing 

From the first history books ever written, it is clear that horse racing has
always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4,500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. 
Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. At first, races were long and between just two horses, but at the beginning of the 18th century this changed. Races became much shorter and had several horses running against each other. 
Today, horse racing is watched by more people than any other sport in the USA, except baseball. It is also very popular in other parts of the world.

Nick Barlow loves his work. He's a British actor and he travels around the world making TV programmes. 'People welcome me everywhere I go and when I get home I remember all the wonderful things that happened in each country.' Nick has travelled to many places but there are a few trips that he would still like to make. 'I'd love to visit South America and go back to Australia one day,' he says.
On each trip, Nick travels with a team of people. They bring the cameras and other filming equipment needed to make the programme. Nick doesn't take a lot of things for himself, just a few shirts and trousers, but he always makes sure he has some books in his suitcase.
Nick's wife, Helen, doesn't mind him travelling for his work. She has a lot of friends and keeps busy. When he gets back, she likes to listen to all his travel stories. But sometimes there are problems. When he was in the Malaysian rain forest, Nick heard that his wife was ill in hospital. 'I felt terrible because I couldn't help, but she didn't want me to come home. I was so happy when I heard she was better.'",A2,,,,,,
51,"Big cats 

There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. 
Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! 
Lions are the only cats that stay together in large family groups. Several lions may work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. 
All cats need good eyes, because they catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast, and very strong. ",A2,,,,,,

53,"Bollywood

'Bollywood', which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.
Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million.
Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.",A2,,,,,,
54,"Buildings 

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. 
Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. 
The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.

57,"Gail Rollins 

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. 
Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch her up. 
Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, ""Are you sure you should be eating that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.'

58,"The Weather 

People are interested in the weather for a lot of reasons and it is important for people in many different jobs. For example, the weather makes a big difference for farmers. 
Many years ago, farmers spent a long time looking at the sky and at animals and flowers to try and learn more about the weather. Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. 
Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Some people also think that when cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain. ",A2,,,,,,
59,"The Elephant Show 

by Daniel Allsop, age 14 

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. 
We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. 
Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. 
There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. 
Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so suddenly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes!

61,"Visit the Edinburgh Festival!

Every year, thousands of people come to Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, to be part of the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks every August and September the city is filled with actors and artists from all over the world. They come to Edinburgh for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time the streets of the city are alive with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even see artists painting pictures on the streets. One of the best parts of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students do comedy shows in small halls and cafes.
Tens of thousands of tourists come to the Festival to see new films and plays and hear music played by famous musicians. This year, you can see over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries.
The tickets for these performances are quite cheap and it is usually easier to see your favourite star in Edinburgh than it is in London. So come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be difficult to find a room, so why not book your hotel now!",A2,,,,,,

There are five different types of rhino in the world today. The Black and White Rhino live in the open fields of Africa. The others live in forests in Asia.
All rhinos have big, heavy bodies. Their skin is very hard and they have very little hair. The great body of the rhino stands on four short legs. Each foot has three toes. They usually walk very slowly, but they can run at 50 kilometres an hour. Rhinos are usually quiet and calm animals, and they only eat grass and other plants.
A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos when it is born. It has been inside its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and may live to be 50 years old.",A2,,,,,,

66,"No Title

Some people have complained about this year's collection, New Writing 3, although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality, for PS6.99, is pretty amazing?
Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers, such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. It's a strange fact that the less well-known people seem to have written mainly about food. Take my advice about Jane Harris' s Those Nails - this piece should definitely not be read just after meals. It contains some very unpleasant scenes which could turn your stomach!
There is fine work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are pieces from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Finally, there is a little non-fiction, which includes a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger on certain newspapers, and an extraordinary piece about herself from Ursula Owen. This is an exceptional collection and I for one can't wait to see what next year's choice will include.",B1,,"Some people do not like this year's book, New Writing 3, but I do not know why.

67,"CARTOON FILMS 

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. 
By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. 
But soon afterwards, one or two directors had some original new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun. 
However, not every cartoon film was successful. The Black Cauldron, for example, failed, mainly because it was too frightening for children and too childish for adults. Directors learnt from this mistake, and the film companies began to make large amounts of money again.

The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends.
Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons.
From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says that her method is not supposed to produce great violinists, and always suggests that pupils who perform particularly well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods.

",B1,,"The best time to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is what Margaret Porter says. She is a violinist and music teacher. Margaret lives in London. She likes to teach children who are three or four years old. But she has also taught many interested five-year-olds. She started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first students were her own children's friends. They were five years old.

Margaret's students learn in groups. A group has about twelve students. They have a lesson every two weeks, and each lesson is one hour long. Each student also has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes, too. It is important that parents are interested in the lessons.

From the first lesson, students learn to play by listening. They do not learn to read music for many years. For a long time, their playing is much better than their music reading. Margaret says her way of teaching is not for making great violinists. If a student is very good, she tells them to go and learn the violin in a more usual way.",,,,

72,"Atlantic College

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually, it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom, as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend the morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers.
One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of those can only attend because they receive government help.
""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like. During the summer holidays my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister.""
To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.
",B1,,"Last week I visited Atlantic College. It is a very good private college in Wales. It is different because it gives young people important life experience outside the classroom. Students also study for their exams. The students are 16 to 18 years old and come from many countries. In the morning they study. In the afternoon they do useful activities. For example, they help on a farm, help people who have learning problems, or check rivers for pollution.

One great thing is that the students come from many different countries and backgrounds. The college costs £20,000 for two years. Not many students can pay this, so the college gives money to help. A quarter of the students are British. Many of them can only go to the college because the government helps them.

A student from the Netherlands, Barbara Molenkamp, said: ""I really like the college because it helps young people from different countries understand each other. You learn to live with people and respect them, even people you don't like. In the summer holidays, my mother was surprised because I argued much less with my sister.""

A month ago I had no idea that on a Saturday afternoon in November I'd be hanging 30 metres above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me, and realised why people love rock-climbing.
My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock- climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we'd done.",B1,,"A month ago, I did not know that I would be 30 metres high on a Saturday in November and like it.

When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run.
I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but also use this as an excuse for not providing separate changing facilities.
I put up posters and 40 women, young and old, fit and unfit, joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river.
At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general.
I wanted to do something for women's running and I've had so much pleasure watching their progress - almost as much as they've had themselves.",B1,,"When I hurt my back, I had to stop running.

77,"MONEY 

What is money? The pound, the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book, a huge bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is only a printed piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, Mr Green the farmer exchanged the com he had grown for Mr Hive's honey. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. The different currencies began to join together, which is why today everyone uses a national currency.

On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book, address book and my purse, which contained about PS50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old, I was a long way from home, and I was quite worried. In fact, I stood by the side of the road and just cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened he said I should keep the fare.
I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would just like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay PS280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.'
Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food.

Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role

'I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I'd only ever acted at school, but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her.
I'd taken a year off to go travelling before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me to say there were plans to turn the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to go for the part. She was surprised at first, but sent my photograph to the director and persuaded him to meet me. I flew back and got the part.
The outdoor filming started a week into term, so I got permission from the university to be away for three weeks. Once I was back at university, I got up at 6.00am to write the essays I'd missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great.
It was an amazing experience I'm so lucky. After university, I definitely want to make acting my career. I'm not from an acting family, though my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV parts but haven't received any offers yet.
I don't know how I managed it all, because I had a full social life too. When filming finished, I hardly knew what to do. I've since appeared in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven't been home much and now my first year at university is over, I'm off to Greece for the summer with friends.'",B1,,"New TV Star

It was a great time and I was very lucky. After university, I want to be an actor. No one else in my family acts, but my grandfather sang opera. I have tried to get other TV parts, but no one has said yes yet.

83,"Grass

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. 
Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. 
Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again. 

",B1,,"Grass is one of the most common plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 kinds of grass. You can find grass in every part of the world. It is the only plant with flowers that can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic.

Grasslands are home to many animals. Small animals like insects and birds live there, and big animals like cows and lions do too. All these animals need grass to live.

Grass grows back very fast after animals eat it or it gets damaged. New grass grows from the bottom, not the top. This means many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass soon grows again for them to eat.",,,,
84,"Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website

Welcome to the website. Here is all you need to know before booking a flight.
During the brief Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a full- size passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over the continent of Antarctica and back.
Flight dates for next year are not definite yet, but if you make a booking now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the day.
Questions
These are answers to the most frequently asked questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.
How long is the flight?
The average flight is 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, Antarctica experts who have lived on scientific research stations there give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera next to the pilot, which is linked to the video system on board, gives you a pilot's eye view throughout, from take-off to landing.
Will I get a seat next to a window?
All passengers are given two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, passengers are asked to move to the seat shown on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a next-to-window seat for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or the seat next to a window seat for half of the flight and an end of row seat for the other half of the flight. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up from their seats and move about the plane, allowing everyone to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow these amazing sights to be seen equally well from both sides of the plane.
What happens if the weather is bad?
We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain looks at the satellite cloud picture on the morning of the flight and selects the direction which promises the clearest views.
Will I see penguins and other wildlife?
As most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 metres below the plane, we can't see them in any detail. We do not land on Antarctica, primarily for environmental reasons. To experience Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.
Can I take photographs?
Definitely! All cameras are welcome. We even provide a few fun onboard photo opportunities where you can experience what it is like to wear Antarctic cold weather clothes.",B1,,"Welcome to our website. Here you can find all the information you need before you book a flight.

In the short Antarctic summer, we take people from Sydney, Australia, on a big passenger plane over Antarctica and back. The plane is a Boeing 747.

We do not have the exact flight dates for next year yet. But if you book now and we change the day, you can move your booking to the new day.

**Questions**

Here are answers to questions people often ask about our flights.

**How long is the flight?**
The flight is about 12 hours long. After about four hours, you can usually see the first ice on the sea and icebergs. We fly over Antarctica for four hours, and then we fly back. On the flight, experts talk about Antarctica. They have lived and worked there. They talk about the place and its history, and they answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot. You can watch the video from this camera on the screens on the plane. It shows you what the pilot sees.

**Will I sit next to a window?**
Everyone gets two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will change seats. You will move to the seat on your second pass.

If you fly in Business or First Class, you will have a window seat for half of the flight. For the other half, you will have the seat next to the window.

If you fly in Economy, you will have a window seat or the seat next to it for half of the flight. For the other half, you will have a seat at the end of the row.

When we are over Antarctica, you can get up and walk around the plane. This way, everyone can see the views. The pilot flies in big 'figure 8' shapes over interesting places. This means people on both sides of the plane can see well.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**
We have 17 different flight plans. On the morning of the flight, the captain checks the weather and picks the way with the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other animals?**
Most animals in Antarctica live on the ground. Our plane flies very high, so we cannot see them well. We do not land in Antarctica. This is to protect the environment. If you want to see the animals, you need to go on a boat trip.

**Can I take photos?**
Yes, of course! You can bring any camera. We also have some fun photo chances on the plane. You can try on special clothes for the cold weather in Antarctica.",,,,
85,"Maria Mutola

In 1988, Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won,' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.'
The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, learnt about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realised immediately that she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I had no idea what he meant. The only sport I knew about was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me training. It was such hard work and my legs really ached.' But Jose visited her parents and persuaded them she could be successful and this would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her away to train.
In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was unlike those of the girls she met in the US. She explains, 'They were good athletes but, while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were brilliant and I learnt a lot.'
Today, Maria still runs and for most of the year she lives happily in South Africa with her mother.",B1,,"In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football in a boys' team in Mozambique.

86,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST 

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, in Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. 
Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University, and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual, as most women then had few opportunities to study. 
After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria where she began teaching mathematics. She soon became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. 
We have no copies of her books, but we know that she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work. 
At the time many rulers were afraid of science, and anyone connected with it was in danger. One day in March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed.

Hypatia studied in other cities. Then she came back to Alexandria to teach maths. She became well-known because she was very clever and knew a lot.

We don't have her books today, but we know she wrote important maths books. She also liked technology and made some tools for her science work.

87,"HONEY 

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. In fact, there are more than three hundred varieties of honey. 
The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. 
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very
rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. 
Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Research suggests that it prevents tiredness and improves athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care 26 A involves products. 

",B1,,"Honey

Honey is a sweet food made by bees. It is made from water and sugar. Bees fly a very long way and visit many, many flowers to make just a little honey. The colour and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are many different kinds of honey.

Light honey usually has a milder taste than dark honey.

A long time ago, honey was the most important sweet food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians thought honey was very valuable. They even used it like money.

Today, people make and eat honey all over the world. Some studies say that honey can give you energy and help you do better in sports. But honey is not just for eating. You can also use it for a sore throat, and it is in many products for your skin and hair.",,,,
88,"Climbing to the top of Britain

Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland, and because of its northerly location, the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis.

It was February, my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred metres up - probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up.
We were carrying tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots -you'd have trouble on Ben Nevis without them because you get snow so hard it's like walking on ice. Even though some of the group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, including lights for attracting attention, hard hats and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when we set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.
The track soon climbed and my legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, I had to rest more frequently. The others sometimes stopped for a break to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them they set off again. I promised myself that in future I would always train properly before a climb.
After 200 metre<;,we reached the beginning of Tower Ridge, the route that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It's only a metre and a half wide and the mountain drops away hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to keep calm and concentrate on every step as we moved slowly along it.
After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. However, we weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down.
On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly a wrong turn could lead to slopes too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top.",B1,,"Climbing to the top of Britain

Gareth Ellis, 13, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth's dream was always to become a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath and Gareth joined the circus. 'People laugh when we tell them,' says Kath. 'But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three.'
When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to see if they could find full-time circus jobs. They both got jobs with a famous circus and Gareth began training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus during the summer and return home for the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to look after the house while they are away.
'I can't say it was easy,' says Kath. 'There was a lot to think about and organise. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving behind our lovely house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.'
'People ask about my education,' says Gareth, 'but from the beginning, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I follow the same books as everyone back at school and I've got a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates.'
And the future? 'It was a difficult decision,' says Kath, 'but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it.' And Gareth? 'I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day', he says, 'perhaps Bippo's circus.'",B1,,"Gareth Ellis is 13 years old. His father, Alan, is an engineer.

90,"The History of Shoes 

In the past, importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins, which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on what is in fashion. 
It was only one hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

Only 150 years ago, people started to wear a left shoe and a right shoe. Before that, both shoes were the same shape. You could wear any shoe on either foot. In the past, people made all shoes by hand. Today, some shoemakers still use their hands, but most shoes are made by machines in big factories. Because of sewing machines, factories can make many shoes. This means more people can buy shoes because they are cheaper.",,,,
91,"Free-diving in the Caribbean

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, the sport in which competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air.
In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath, and come back up to the top without help. She had been deeper a year before but on that occasion she swam back up using a balloon. This time, however, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man. A team of fourteen safety divers at different depths watched the dive.
Following reports of several serious accidents involving other divers, some people have complained that free-diving is too dangerous a sport, but Tanya doesn't agree, insisting that safety is the most important thing, followed closely by training.
Most free-divers concentrate on one or two types of event within the sport, but whatever Tanya is in training for, her practice timetable remains the same. Two thirds of the programme is spent doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart. However, she doesn't run, whether outdoors or on running machines, because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness. When she starts doing practice dives, she generally travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over a four-week period, with a rest day between each diving day. It is essential that she doesn't get tired because that could ruin all the preparation.
When Tanya is not preparing for an event, she makes frequent public appearances, mainly to advertise sports products. She has also supported environmental organisations, for example doing research projects or making films. Spending her childhood on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she went swimming whenever she could, and long afternoons were spent exploring rockpoolsinordertowatchthesealife.Tanyasaysthatherlifetodayislikelivingherchildhood dreams. Because she is well-known in some countries, she thinks people are prepared to listen to her when she is talking about environmental issues.
As for the future, Tanya, who is now in her thirties, says she plans to keep breaking her own world records. As she didn't take up free-diving until she was twenty-five, Tanya is keen to stress that she doesn't intend to retire from the sport for many years to come.",B1,,"Free-diving in the Caribbean

Tanya Streeter is a world record holder in free-diving. In this sport, people dive very deep underwater while holding their breath.

In 2003, Tanya did something amazing. She dove 120 meters down into the ocean and came back up, all on one breath. She did not use any help. A year before, she went even deeper, but she used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for more than three and a half minutes. This made her the first woman in any sport to break a man's world record. A team of fourteen safety divers watched her during the dive.

Some people think free-diving is too dangerous. They talk about bad accidents that have happened to other divers. But Tanya does not agree. She says safety is the most important thing, and training is also very important.

Most free-divers do only one or two types of dives. But Tanya's training plan is always the same. She spends two-thirds of her time training in a gym. The rest of the time she trains in a pool or in the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she does not want to hurt her knees. She walks fast instead to get fit.

When she practices diving, she usually goes away from home. She does fourteen dives over four weeks. She rests for one day between each dive day. It is very important that she does not get too tired.

When Tanya is not training, she often appears in public to talk about sports products. She also helps environmental groups. Sometimes she does research or makes films. She grew up on Grand Cayman, a Caribbean island. As a child, she loved to swim. She spent many afternoons looking at sea animals in rock pools. Tanya says her life now is like her childhood dream. Because she is famous, people listen to her when she talks about the environment.

92,"Little Chefs

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay PS280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.'
Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking!

93,"San Francisco 

San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. 
He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly, although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. 
In 1849, people arrived in San Francisco in their thousands hoping to find gold. However, it was not the men looking for the gold that got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. 
Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

95,"Rock Band

Two years ago,our 14-year-old s on,Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first,we were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued ,'and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.'
That was just the beginning. Because drums are not the easiest instrument to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. And so, for several hours a week,the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.
At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band start practising, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenage - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people.
Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet. I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.",B1,,"Two years ago, our son Ben was 14. He asked for drums for his birthday. At first, we did not like the idea because of the noise. Ben said, ""It is better than watching TV or playing computer games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we said yes. We told him, ""You must think about the family and the neighbours when you play.""

That was only the start. Drums are big and hard to move. So the other boys in Ben's band came to our house. They brought their guitars and other music things. Now, for a few hours every week, the house is loud with music and singing.

Ben's hobby is good for our health. When the band plays, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, the boys are friendly and polite. Their music is strange to me, but I am not young. They play often in clubs for young people in our town.

We worry that Ben will not study enough because of the band. But so far, he is doing okay. I always tell Ben that school is very important. One thing is true: Ben was right. The drums keep him out of trouble, and he is never bored.",,,,

98,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA,
Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. This town grew so quickly during 1909 that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the summer months, essential supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat, but in the winter the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to them. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners.
The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat for both themselves and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.
However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but, unfortunately, the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot considered skilled enough to manage the flight, was away on a trip at the time. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead.
The trip covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska looking for gold, travelled the first 400 of those kilometres. He had to trust his dog Togo's ability to find his way in the blinding snow and Togo turned out to be a reliable guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point Balto refused to go any further, and saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped and Balto became a hero.
Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.",B1,,"The Iditarod is a famous dog sled race. It started because of gold in Alaska a long time ago. In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska. Many people went there to find gold and get rich. They built new towns. One town was called Iditarod. It means a place that is very far away.

In the summer, boats brought food and other things to the towns. But in winter, the water was ice. Boats could not come. So, in 1910, people made a winter path. Dog teams pulled sleds on this path. They took mail, food, and clothes to the people looking for gold. This path was called the Iditarod Trail.

Later, people started using airplanes. They did not use the dog teams as much. But in 1925, the dogs were very important again. People in the city of Nome were very sick. They needed medicine. The medicine was in a city called Anchorage. It was very far away. The weather was too cold for airplanes. So, they used dog teams to bring the medicine.

Many dog teams worked together. They ran over 1,000 kilometers. It took them only six days. One man, Leonhard Seppala, and his dog Togo, ran 400 kilometers. Another man, Gunnar Kaasen, and his dog Balto, finished the trip. Balto was a hero because he saved the team from danger. The medicine helped the sick people.

Today, people remember this journey with a race. Every year, there is a dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome. It is called the Iditarod. People call it ""The Last Great Race on Earth.""",,,,
99,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London intending to study law, but went to art school instead. There he found the traditional drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting.
In his late twenties he was given money by the Italian government to study art, and became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and wanted to put this light into his paintings.
This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark, but he insists he's never sure what the results will be. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.'
Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not do the painting afterwards.
Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.'
Since moving to London years ago, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters.
",B1,,"The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, drawing was hard for him, but he continued to paint.

When he was almost thirty, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He liked early Italian artists, and you can see this in his work. He loved the green and brown colours of the Italian fields and the bright light. He tried to put this light into his paintings.

To do this, he painted light colours first, then darker colours on top. But he says he never knows how the painting will look in the end. He says, ""It's a secret because I don't know. I don't start with yellow and then know what colour I will put on top."" Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it sound simple. ""Anyone can use colours — you can buy them. I just look at which colours I put next to each other.""

He is different from some artists because he never draws before he paints. He thinks that if he draws first, he might get bored and not paint.

Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he likes to paint people who don't ask to see the painting while he is working. He says, ""If I think they are worried and want to see the painting, I can't paint it.""

100,"ZOOS 

People began to keep animals in zoos over 3,000 years ago, when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos, animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. 
Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everybody approves of zoos. People who think that zoos are a good idea say they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals. Both of these would not be possible without zoos. On the other hand, some people disapprove of zoos because they believe it is wrong to put animals in cages, and argue that in zoos which are not managed properly, animals live in dirty conditions and eat unsuitable food. 

",B1,,"People started keeping animals in zoos more than 3,000 years ago. The rulers of China made a very big zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence.

101,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival, an annual nine-day event.
The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. There were about a dozen hot-air balloons and they took off from the car park in the middle of Albuquerque. From these small beginnings, the festival has grown steadily. This year at least a thousand balloons from over one third of the countries of the world are expected at its current out-of-town site.
What to see
The pilots are in radio contact with each other and all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. These are known as 'balloon glows' and are an opportunity to take fantastic photographs. However, you must arrive just after night has fallen or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky.
During the day, you can walk around among the balloons and chat to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colours, some in the shapes of animals or cartoon characters and, of course, well-known products such as varieties of soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it.
In the afternoon, why not take to the sky yourself by arranging a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering balloon rides? Another possibility is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest such ride anywhere, and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are plenty of other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and firework displays on the opening evening and the last three evenings of the festival.
The Albuquerque Box
This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds, and at the same time create gentler currents of wind at different heights. This means that by rising or descending, skilful pilots can control the direction of their balloons.
Practical advice
Buy your tickets in advance (they are available on line) and save yourself a long wait to get into the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. At night and in the early morning it can be quite cool, but during the day sunglasses and suncream are essential. Bring a flashlight for night-time events and, of course, bring your camera. If you're not a digital photographer, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night-time pictures.",B1,,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky over the city of Albuquerque in the USA becomes full of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. It happens every year and lasts for nine days.

The first festival was in 1972. It was for the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were only about twelve hot-air balloons. They flew from a car park in the city. Now the festival is much bigger. This year, about a thousand balloons from many countries will be there. The festival is now outside the city.

What to see
The balloon pilots talk to each other on the radio. Sometimes, they all turn on their balloon fires at the same time. This is called a 'balloon glow'. It is very beautiful to see in the dark sky and you can take great photos. You need to come just after it gets dark or very early in the morning to see this.

During the day, you can walk near the balloons and talk to the pilots. The balloons are many different sizes and colours. Some look like animals or cartoon people. Children will love it.

In the afternoon, you can go for a balloon ride over the desert. Many companies offer this. Or you can take the cable car up the nearby mountain. It is the longest cable car in the world. From the top, you can see the festival from high up. There are also balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival. There is fun for everyone.

The Albuquerque Box
This is a special wind near the city. It is very good for balloons. The mountains stop strong winds. This lets pilots control their balloons well by going up or down.

Some useful information
Buy your tickets before you go. You can buy them online. Then you will not have to wait a long time to get in. Wear different layers of clothes. It can be cold at night and in the morning, but sunny and warm during the day. You will need sunglasses and suncream. Bring a flashlight for the night and, of course, your camera.",,,,

Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion and has just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree.

After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a PS20,000 loan and begin her own womenswear label.

Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her.

104,"Write a winning story!

You could win PS1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story printed in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky people will win a cheque forPS100.
Once again, we need people who can write good stories. The judges, who include Mary Littlejohn, the novelist, Michael Brown, the television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, Keep Writing's editor, are looking for interesting and original stories. Detective fiction was extremely popular last year, although the competition winner produced a love story. You can write about whatever you want but here's some advice to start you thinking:
Write about what you know
This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends - these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way.
Get your facts right
It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it.
Hold the reader's attention
Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end.
Think about the characters
Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.
Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words and typed, double-spaced, on one side only of each sheet of paper.
Even if you're in danger of missing the closing date, we are unable to accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately your story cannot be returned, nor can we discuss our decisions.
You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country - a change in the rules by popular request- and the story must not have appeared in print or in recorded form, for example on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.

Write about things you know
This is important for every writer. Last year, most writers did this. They wrote about love, family, and friends. But you need to make normal things interesting. Write about everyday things in a new way so people want to keep reading.

Check your facts
If you write about a town or a machine, make sure your information is correct. Do not write about things you are not sure of.

Keep the reader interested
Make the start of your story exciting. The ending should be a surprise. A bad ending is not good. Think carefully about your story and try to have something unusual happen at the end.

Think about your characters
Use good words to make the people in your story feel real to the reader.

Your story must be your own work. It must be between 2,000 and 2,500 words. Type it with double space on one side of the paper only.

105,"Being an older student

At 32, I have just finished my first year at university. As well as attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays.
I decided to go to university after fourteen years away from the classroom. As a secretary, although I was earning a reasonable amount of money, I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in the job. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who looked happy, carefree and full of hope, and part of something that I wanted to explore further.
However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. They are always mistaking me for a lecturer and asking me questions I can't answer. I also feel separated from the lecturers because, although we are the same age, I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job, which is really important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. Then there are the normal student benefits of long holidays and theatre and cinema discounts. I often have doubts about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this late date has been a wise choice.",B1,,"I am an older student

I am 32 years old. I just finished my first year at university. I go to all my classes. I also learned to read books fast and write long essays.

I decided to go to university after 14 years away from school. Before, I was a secretary. I made good money, but the work was boring. I didn't need to think much. I felt sad because I thought I could not leave that job. I saw the students at the university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be like them.

But now, it is sometimes difficult with the younger students. They think I am a teacher and ask me questions I don't know. I also feel different from the teachers. We are the same age, but they know much more than me. Still, I am happy to study. I know you need a degree to get a good job, and that is important to me. I am not like most 18-year-olds. On the weekend, I like to stay home with my books, not go to parties. I also like the long holidays and cheaper tickets for the cinema and theatre. I sometimes worry about what I will do after university, but I hope going back to school was a good choice.",,,,
106,"Henry Ford 

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1,500 kilometres, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T', which sold for $825. He was soon selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice. 'You can have any colour you like,' said Henry Ford of the Model T,'as long as it's black.'

107,"The Ghan Train 

Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. 

The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. 
The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide as far as Alice Springs, but there was often serious flooding on the line making it difficult for trains to pass. A new line was completed a few months before my journey. 
The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph and the Ghan is certainly not a high- speed, inter-city train - there are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. Nor does the Ghan aim to provide luxury in the same way that a train like the Orient Express does, although the on-board food is excellent. 
The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. 
It is not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I could see that everyone was really looking forward to the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up the majority of my fellow travellers, were particularly keen to board. 
Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged nowadays and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. 
From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't particularly interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with nothing to look at but cattle. But at dawn on the third day we reached the foothills of an area close to the Southern Ocean. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer. 

 
",B1,,"Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south.

The Ghan train goes across Australia. It travels from the warm north coast, through a very big desert, to the colder south near the ocean. People call it the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is also famous for often arriving late.

A long time ago, in the 1920s, people built a train line from Adelaide to Alice Springs. This was part of the plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide. But there was often a lot of water on the tracks, so trains could not pass. A new train line was finished just a few months before Mark's trip.

The train can go up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a very fast city train. It does not stop many times, and most people on the train are on holiday. The Ghan is also not a very fancy train like the Orient Express, but the food on the train is very good.

The railway was first made to carry things to sell, not people. People thought it would be faster and cheaper to send things from Europe to the south of Australia by ship to Darwin and then by train, instead of by ship all the way around Australia.

It is special to finish a railway across a continent. The Ghan says it is the world's first railway that goes from the north to the south. When Mark waited to get on the train, he saw that everyone was very excited for the trip. Many of the other passengers were older Australians, and they were especially happy to get on the train.

The first stop was at Katherine. The train waited there for four hours. Some people left the train and took a boat trip. Mark did not leave the train until Alice Springs. There, he went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a few other people and a guide. Today, people are asked not to climb the rock, and very few people do. Mark's group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, two trains go south each week, so many people stop their trip there. After Alice Springs, the view from the train is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land, and you only see cows. But on the third day, early in the morning, they reached some hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's trip was finished. The train did not have everything the advertisements said, but it showed him some of the most wonderful places in Australia.",,,,
108,"Winter Driving

Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road.
Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Uneven movements can make a car suddenly very difficult to control. So every time you either turn the wheel, touch the brakes or increase your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Imagine you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it.
Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will avoid trouble.",B1,,"Driving in Winter

Winter driving can be dangerous. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents happen easily. You might see fog at the top of a hill. Ice could be under the snow, and it can make your car leave the road. Another car might slide towards you.

Rule 1: Drive smoothly on icy roads. Sudden moves can make your car hard to control. When you turn, brake, or go faster, do it slowly and carefully. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you do not spill it.

Rule 2: Watch what could happen. If there is ice, look far ahead. Gently press the brake to see how long it takes to stop. You might be driving faster than you think. On a wet road, leave twice the normal space to stop. On snow, leave three times the space. On ice, leave even more space. Always try to control your car, and you will stay safe.",,,,
109,"Shopping for furniture 

A report by Dave Worthington 

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for PS45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for PS30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced that it wouldn't close at all for the first 24 hours. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: 'The police had been informed that a large crowd was expected but people just weren't patient. The shop was soon full and the managers sensibly decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and they refused to queue quietly until there was space for them inside. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What I really couldn't believe was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. This meant that the road was then completely blocked.' 
One customer, Jenny Smith, who managed to get into the shop, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They didn't have any choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.' 
",B1,,"A new furniture shop called Homestyle had to close very soon after it opened at midnight last Thursday. About 6,000 people went to the shop quickly. There were many special prices, like a leather sofa for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am).

The shop's usual opening times are 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. But it had to close just 30 minutes after opening. A police officer at the shop said: ""We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full very fast, so the managers closed it. People outside were angry because they thought all the furniture would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait in line. Another problem was the long line of cars trying to get to the car park. I was surprised that many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: ""I waited in line for three hours and I did not have time to buy what I wanted. But the workers were calm and told us what was happening. They had to close because it was not safe. I will go back when the shop opens again, but I will not wait in line another time.""",,,,
110,"The Eden Project 

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular tourist attractions. At first sight, the huge 'biospheres' on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. 

Each biosphere contains a different climate zone, showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is amazing to see just how many products that we use every day come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plant are grown here. However cold the weather is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. 
In the Rainforest Zone, the atmosphere is always damp because of a huge waterfall. Another zone reproduces the environment of the Mediterranean, California and South Africa, and there are plans to build a desert zone in the near future.

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people 

The members of our agency are aged 8-18. We collect news and write news reports, stories and articles. We send these to leading national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio and websites to be published. The news stories and articles by our members that are accepted by newspapers and TV and radio stations, can all be read or listened to on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three centres around the country where young people can meet other members and get involved in projects, and we intend to open new centres nationwide.
Since our news agency started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says:
'I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I sat in a room with a team of young journalists and was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age wasn't important, they were trusted to do the stories on their own. 
I started going to the Eight-eighteen centre in my city, got some training, then was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen has helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With all the skills I learnt, I got a job at 19, and am currently the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles written by the journalists before putting them onto the site.' 

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you'll be trained and you'll take part in monthly meetings to decide who is going to be responsible for writing each news story.
Eight-eighteen encourages skills-sharing between members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced Eight-eighteen members who are 12 years old and over. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they become more experienced as trainers, some members present sessions to audiences of young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips.
Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next new-members' training will be in February. If you, or someone you know, is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen programme is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free and there is no test to join.

112,"Joining the Kirov Ballet 

I'm Nathalie. Last year I was one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous as I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered round, asking me questions, all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved enormously and I understand my teachers. 
For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me and when she left, I was a bit sad. In fact, I called home late at night once to speak to her because I felt a little lonely. 
Compared with my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. That makes me confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. 
Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops - even during December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10oC, but the Russians said it was mild for the time of year! At least it was warm and cosy in my room. At the moment we are preparing for a new production and there's also a competition for young dancers which I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.

113,"Watering the Desert

It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh, Morocco. It doesn't happen frequently and when it does, the city's water pipes can't manage the sudden floods, which turn the streets into rivers. But, as many winters have remained dry in recent times, when the rain does come, it is welcomed by the local people. 
Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist, not because of the rain, but thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. Basically dry places, which receive their water in this way, are known as oases. 
Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here every available piece of land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.

114,"THE ICEHOTEL 

For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. In the winter of 1990 the French artist Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night a group of foreign guests decided it would be a good idea to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The following morning the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today it is world famous. 
As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed. As the ICEHOTEL is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season, the finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. 
Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC, however cold it may be outside. Winter outer clothes such as warm overalls, hats and gloves are included in the cost of guests' stay at the hotel. In addition to this, it is a good idea for guests to bring sweaters and a scarf as well as plenty of woollen socks and to choose footwear that is larger than normal to allow space for thick socks. 
If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in. 
The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL. 
 
",B1,,"The ICEHOTEL

For many years, people visited the Arctic in summer to see the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there with the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people decided that the cold, dark winter could be a good thing. In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an art show in a special snow building called an igloo. This was in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, on the frozen Torne River. The building was called Arctic Hall, and many visitors came to see it. One night, some visitors slept in the Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were happy about their night. That was the start of the ice hotel idea. Now, it is famous all over the world.

Every winter, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi. They build the hotel for that year. When one part is ready, it opens to visitors. The other parts are still being built. The first part is ready in December. Each week, a new part opens. The hotel is finished on January 7th. Because the ICEHOTEL is built outside with natural winter materials, the finish date can change if the weather changes. In spring, when the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts.

Inside the hotel, the temperature is between -5°C and -8°C, even if it is much colder outside. The price for staying at the hotel includes warm winter clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves. It is also a good idea to bring sweaters, a scarf, and many wool socks. Wear shoes that are bigger than usual so you can wear thick socks.

If you want to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, wool socks, and other things on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit. They will be in your room when you arrive.

The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi village. It is 200 km north of the Arctic Circle. It is only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.",,,,

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. 'Here again' is a followup to 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums.
It is clear from the first song on the CD which is a dance tune that the band is no longer going to concentrate on slow songs. The second tune is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most later lacks are in the bands more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single though because they are excellent.
Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has rented in the band having to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as dl the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.)
On this CD Moonshine show they can produce perfect music in a variety of styles from the slow ones we are familiar with to the ones that will keep your feet tapping. I did feel though that they put their best songs at the beginning and the last few tracks were not of quite the same quality.

The first song is a dance song. This shows the band is not only making slow songs. The second song is also a dance song. It is louder. Most other songs are slow. This is the band's usual style. These two new songs will surprise fans. They are very good. Either one could be a hit song.

Singer Rob Letchford sings very well. He hits every note right. Fans will be happy he recorded the songs before his throat got sick. Because his throat is sick, the band cannot go on tour now. If you bought a ticket, do not worry. The concerts will happen when Rob is better.

This CD shows Moonshine can make good music in different styles. There are slow songs we know. There are new songs that make you want to dance. I think the best songs are at the start. The last few songs are not as good. But 'Here again' will be a big hit. It will make the band more successful.",,,,

The Grand Canyon in the United States was created by the River Colorado. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to go walking and running but mainly to look at the view. It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres. It is a platform whose walls and floor are built of glass so that you can see the beautiful rocks of the canyon. Up to 120 people are allowed to stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007 and since then thousands of people have used it. You have to wear special covers over your shoes to avoid scratching the glass beneath your feet. Walking onto the Skywalk makes you feel like a bird floating high up in the air.

117,"Anna's new school 

It's been a very exciting week, as we've just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place, as the builders have used wood for the whole thing, just like in our old school, but it's also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. 
The school took months to build, so we saw it all happening. It was really exciting seeing the builders clear the space where it would be, although it also meant that some lovely open land disappeared. And the noise of the building machines was really loud, although the builders often had to stop work because it rained so hard. We all began to think the building would never be finished. 
We have five classrooms now, which are enormous - much bigger than in our previous school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town when they want to have meetings and so on. There's a nursery too, a lovely dining room, and really big changing rooms which we're looking forward to using as soon as our new sports field is ready. 
When you come into the school, one of the first things you notice is that there aren't any heaters in the building! Instead, the heat for the school comes from all of us inside it - the children, the teachers and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it holds all the heat inside - and all the sound too, so if we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we're inside a concert hall! 
Another thing you'll notice is that the school roof has a tree on top of it! It was put there by the builders once they'd finished the roof, because they said it was the custom in Austria, the country where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. It's so big, it can be seen for miles! We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. 
Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it - for example, at the moment we're putting on a play for parents to come and see, but we still have to walk back to our old school hall to do it. The replacement will be ready by next year, though. We're so pleased with our new school, and our teachers say we'll all learn much faster now we're in it!

This week was very exciting because we moved to our new school building! It is a great place. The builders used wood for everything, like in our old school. But it is also one of the first schools in my country that is good for the environment.

The school took many months to build, so we watched it happen. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but we were sad to lose some nice open space. The building machines were very loud. The builders often had to stop work when it rained a lot. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now we have five classrooms. They are very big - much bigger than in our old school next door. We share one room with people from the town when they want to have meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We can't wait to use them when our new sports field is ready.

When you come into the school, you will see there are no heaters! The heat comes from all of us inside - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is made to keep the heat inside. It also keeps the sound inside. When we sing in our classrooms, it sounds like we are in a concert hall!

Another thing you will see is a tree on the school roof! The builders put it there when they finished the roof. They said it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. Our electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. Yesterday we went with our teacher to see it. It turns very fast. It is so big you can see it from far away! We took some photos to put on the website.

We are using the school building now, but some parts are not ready yet. For example, we are doing a play for our parents, but we have to go to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school. Our teachers say we will learn much better here!",,,,

By Katie Atkins, aged 14 

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! 
Each band had their own costumes, ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore, to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but all of us were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially considering everyone was so young. Players from each band even created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch - but even better when my band played on stage! 
We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half, in fact. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country - I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. 
Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you. 
My school's really lucky because we have great teachers, and parents who've supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music!

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we had a jazz competition with bands from other schools. Our band won!

Each band wore different clothes. My band wore black school uniforms. Some bands wore bright T-shirts. We did not look like adult bands, but we all played very well. Some players even made new music on the stage. It was fun to watch, but the best part was when my band played.

My school has a good jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the students who try get in. But everyone who likes jazz can go to practice before school. We also meet after school to listen to jazz and learn about it. Sometimes we go to jazz camps in the summer. I went to two camps and learned a lot.

Grown-ups are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher says it's because pop music is not difficult enough for students who love music. I like jazz because it is old and new at the same time. You can make your own music, but you also feel connected to jazz history when you play.

My school is lucky because we have good teachers and parents who help us. Without them, we could not do well in music!",,,,

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting description of everyday life in England between 1660 and 1669. Pepys writes about important news stories of the time, like disease, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. 
He also writes about himself, even about his faults - he often slept during church or looked at the pretty girls. He describes his home life - a quarrel with his wife and how they became friends again, his worry about her illness. As well as books, he liked music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and plenty of fun. Pepys was a busy man who had many important jobs 
- he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work for the British Navy.

120,"Sharks

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well, and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. 
Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, most sharks ought to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks. It allows them to find out more about these fascinating creatures.

121,"Norwich

Norwich, the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia, has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England.
With two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has long been a popular centre for various religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and has recently celebrated its 900th anniversary, while Norwich itself had a year of celebration in 1994 to mark the 800th anniversary of the city receiving a Royal Charter. This allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself independently.
Today, in comparison with places like London or Manchester, Norwich is quite small, with a population of around 150,000, but in the 16th century Norwich was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years and got richer and richer, becoming famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year.
Nowadays, there are far fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964 the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. With its fast-growing student population and its success as a modern commercial centre (Norwich is the biggest centre for insurance services outside London), the city new has a wide choice of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and a number of arts and leisure centres. There is also a football team, whose colours are green and yellow. The team is known as 'The Canaries', though nobody can be sure why.
Now the city's attractions include another important development, a modern shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. The people of Norwich lived with a very large hole in the middle of their city for over two years, as builders dug up the main car park. Lorries moved nearly a million tons of earth so that the roof of the Mall could become a city centre park, with attractive water pools and hundreds of trees. But the local people are really pleased that the old open market remains, right in the heart of the city and next to the new development. Both areas continue to do good business, proving that Norwich has managed to mix the best of the old and the new.",B1,,"Norwich is a city in the east of Britain.

In the years since we began I have learned a lot. Much of what I have learned will be found in this book, for I believe that we, as a company, have something worth saying about how to run a successful business without giving up what we really believe in.

Business can be fun, a business can be run with love and it can do good. In business, as in life, I need to enjoy myself, to have a feeling of family and to feel excited by the unexpected. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.
Now this book sends these ideas of mine out into the world, makes them public. I'd like to think there are no limits to our 'family', no limits to what can be done. I find that an exciting thought. I hope you do, too.

124,"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The sons are composers and prize-winning musicians, while Dad makes the instruments. Matthew Rye reports.
Whole families of musicians are not exactly rare. However, it is unusual to come across one that includes not only writers and performers of music, but also an instrument maker.
When South Wales schoolteachers John and Hetty Watkins needed to get their ten-year-old son, Paul, a cello to suit his blossoming talents, they baulked at the costs involved. 'We had a look at various dealers and it was obvious it was going to be very expensive,' John says.
'So I wondered if I could actually make one. I discovered that the Welsh School of Instrument Making was not far from where I lived, and I went along for evening classes once a week for about three years.'
'After probably three or four goes with violins and violas, he had a crack at his first cello,' Paul, now 28, adds. 'It turned out really well. He made me another one a bit later, when he'd got the hang of it. And that's the one I used right up until a few months ago.' John has since retired as a teacher to work as a full-time craftsman, and makes up to a dozen violins a year - selling one to the esteemed American player Jaime Laredo was 'the icing on the cake'. Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from an early age. The piano came first: 'As soon as I was big enough to climb up and bang the keys, that's what I did,' Paul remembers. But it wasn't long before the cello beckoned. 'My folks were really quite keen for me to take up the violin, because Dad, who played the viola, used to play chamber music with his mates and they needed another violin to make up a string trio.
I learned it for about six weeks but didn't take to it. But I really took to the character who played the cello in Dad's group. I thought he was a very cool guy when I was six or seven. So he said he'd give me some lessons, and that really started it all off. Later, they suggested that my brother play the violin too, but he would have none of it.'
'My parents were both supportive and relaxed,' Huw says. 'I don't think I would have responded very well to being pushed. And, rather than feeling threatened by Paul's success, I found that I had something to aspire to.' Now 22, he is beginning to make his own mark as a pianist and composer.
Meanwhile, John Watkins' cello has done his elder son proud. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. Then, at the remarkably youthful age of 20, he was appointed principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held, still playing his father's instrument, until last year. Now, however, he has acquired a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 'Dad's not said anything about me moving on, though recently he had the chance to run a bow across the strings of each in turn and had to admit that my new one is quite nice! I think the only thing Dad's doesn't have - and may acquire after about 50-100 years - is the power to project right to the back of large concert halls. It will get richer with age, like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.' 
Soon he will be seen on television playing the Rugeri as the soloist in Elgar's Cello Concerto, which forms the heart of the second programme in the new series, Masterworks. 'The well-known performance history doesn't affect the way I play the work,' he says. 'I'm always going to do it my way.' But Paul won't be able to watch himself on television - the same night he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival. Nor will Huw,whose String Quartet is receiving its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall the same evening. John and Hetty will have to be diplomatic - and energetic - if they are to keep track of all their sons' musical activities over the coming weeks.",B2,"Meet the Watkins Family

John said, ""I can make a cello."" He went to a school to learn. He went to classes at night. He went for three years.

First, he made violins. Then he made a cello for Paul. Paul is 28 now. He said, ""The cello was good. My dad made me another cello later. I used that cello for a long time.""

Now John does not teach. He makes instruments all day. He makes twelve violins a year. He sold a violin to a famous American musician. That was very good.

Paul and his brother Huw started music when they were small. First, they played the piano. Paul said, ""When I was big, I played the piano.""

But then Paul wanted to play the cello. His mum and dad wanted him to play the violin. His dad played music with friends. They needed a violin player. Paul played the violin for six weeks. But he did not like it.

Paul liked the man with the cello in his dad's group. Paul said, ""I thought he was cool. I was six or seven. He gave me lessons. That is how I started.""

Later, his mum and dad wanted Huw to play the violin. But Huw said no.

Huw said, ""My mum and dad were nice. They did not make me play. I liked that my brother was good. I wanted to be good too."" Huw is 22 now. He plays the piano and writes music.

John's cello helped Paul win a big music game. When Paul was 20, he got a good job with an orchestra. He used his dad's cello for that job.

Now Paul has a new cello. It is very old - 304 years old. He got it from a music school. Paul said, ""My dad's cello is good. But my new cello is good too. My dad's cello will get better when it is old.""

Soon, Paul will play on TV. He will play a special song. But he will not watch TV. He will play music at a festival that night.

We always went to Ireland in June. Ever since the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have had to add to the building, but everything has been done most discreetly.
It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He'd come across an advertisement in the days when the Malseeds still felt the need to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel that had been recommended by friends, but it hadn't been a success because the food was so appalling.
The four of us have been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. They call me Milly, though strictly speaking my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good, I suppose. He and Strafe were at school together, which must be why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think.
'How ve1y nice,' Mrs Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. Some instinct seems to tell her when guests are about to arrive, for she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she commanded the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs Malseed herself painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.
'Well, well, well,' Mr Malseed said, now entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish manner. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us think we were rather more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, causing eve1yone in the hall to laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, canying as much of our luggage as he could manage and returning for the remainder.
After dinner we played cards for a while but not going on for as long as we might because we were still quite tired after the journey. In the lounge there was a man on his own and a French couple. There had been other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window we could see some of them strolling about the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere.
I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.",B2,,"Every June, we went to Ireland. For many years, the four of us spent the first two weeks at Glencorn Lodge. It is a big house by the sea, near a village called Ardbeag. An English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made it bigger, but they did it in a nice way.

Strafe found this place for us. He saw an advertisement. ""What about this?"" he said one night and told us about it. The year before, we went to a different hotel. Our friends said it was good, but the food was very bad. We did not like it.

The four of us are Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. My real name is Dorothy, but my friends call me Milly. Dekko got his name at school. He and Strafe were at school together. That is why we call Strafe by his last name. We are all about the same age. We live near the town where the Malseeds lived before they moved from England to Ireland. We think that is a funny thing.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said. She smiled to welcome us again. She always knows when people are coming. She waits in the big hall. It always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the bags to the rooms,"" she said to the old man. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium."" These are the names of our rooms. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. She does not use numbers. In winter, not many people come. Then she does small jobs like this. Her husband fixes things in the hotel.

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said. He came into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he said in the Irish way. He smiled a lot. His dark brown eyes were happy. He made us feel special. Everyone smiled. I felt our holiday was really starting. Nothing was different at Glencorn. Everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came to say hello. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said. Everyone laughed. Arthur took our bags to the rooms. He carried a lot and then went back for the rest.

After dinner, we played cards for a short time. We did not play long because we were tired from the trip. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner too. In June, the hotel is always full. From our seats by the window, we saw some people walking on the grass. Others were walking down to the sea. In the morning, we would do the same. We would walk on the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there. Then we would come back for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive to another place.

126,"IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT

What keeps film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their home comforts for months on end? The search for the perfect shot.
Of all the creatures to be found in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to track down must surely be producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman.
Their present habitat, the Ngorongoro Crater, has been lashed by six months of almost continuous rain, rise to a number of unforeseen problems. Newman explained that they had to invest in an expensive piece of equipment so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. His working partnership with the talented producer has created some of TV's finest wildlife films, such as their amazing and well-received film on leopards.
Even while this film of one of Africa's shyest cats was being shown, the pair were already back where they belong - this time trailing that equally shy animal, the jackal. But this is nothing unusual in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been constantly circling the globe, in order to point cameras at exotic wildlife ever since the birth of television.
I spoke to Newman about their partnership while he was making one of his rare and unpredictable reunions with other members of the human race at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we tend to get over them fairly quickly,' he says of his colleague. Neither of them regard themselves as the leader, and he says that one of the reasons why they get on so well with each other is that they both see the animals in a similar way.
'When we are on the move, we have to put up our tents each night. But this time we are operating much more of a fixed camp, and as we set out at 5 a.m. each morning, we tend to make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.'
The rest of the Newman-Barrett daily diet consists of pre-packed meals heated and dished out by whoever is at hand at the time. 'It's not unusual for us to be out and about for up to eight weeks at a time, so catering does cause the odd panic,' says Newman.
It can be a rough existence, but the appeal of being alone in such remote areas is that we can get close enough to the animals to become part of their lives. I remember once we were filming a family of lions and there was one lioness who would regularly go off on her own. Whenever she returned, she would go round and greet all the other members of the pride, and after a while she made a point of greeting our car as part of her round.'
It was back in 1988 that Newman first worked with Barrett on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two more years before they set off as a team to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to set aside four months on location to gather sufficient material for each half-hour film. And before they get the green light, they have to submit a script for approval.
'Amanda and I struck up a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because it was obvious that we shared the same ideas and overall vision. What we are always seeking to achieve is a film that is rich in atmosphere, that brings to life the true spirit of the place and animals, and that will touch people's hearts. I believe if you can evoke an emotional response from people, that is far better than if you appeal only to their heads.'
",B2,"Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman make films about animals. They travel for many months. They want to take good pictures.

They are in East Africa. It is hard to find them. Now they are in the Ngorongoro Crater. It rained for six months. This is a problem. Their car gets stuck in the mud. They have a special machine. Amanda can pull the car out.

They make good wildlife films. People like their film about leopards. After that film, they went to find jackals. This is normal for people who make TV shows. They travel all over the world to film animals.

Newman talked about his work. He and Amanda are good partners. They sometimes argue, but not for long. No one is the boss. They both like animals in the same way.

They sleep in tents. Now, they have a camp. They wake up at 5 a.m. They make tea at night and keep it hot.

They eat food from packets. They heat the food. Sometimes they are away for eight weeks. It is hard to find food.

Their life is not easy. But they like quiet places. They can get close to the animals. One time, they filmed lions. A lioness came to their car.

They started working together in 1988. They made a film about Arctic foxes. Now, they need four months to make one film. First, they write a plan for the film. Someone must say yes to the plan.

They are good partners. They have the same ideas. They want to make films that show animals' lives. They want people to feel something when they watch. This is good.","IN THEIR NATURAL HOME

Why do Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their homes for many months? They want to take the perfect video.
In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest people to find are Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman. They make wildlife films.
Right now, they are living in the Ngorongoro Crater. It has rained for six months. This causes problems. Newman says they bought expensive equipment. When their car gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him out.
He and Amanda work well together. They have made some of TV's best wildlife films, like their popular film about leopards.
While people watched that film, Amanda and Owen were already back in Africa. This time, they were filming jackals. This is normal for TV teams. Since TV began, film-makers have travelled the world to film animals.
I talked to Newman at a safari lodge. He doesn't meet other people often. He said, ""We sometimes argue, but we become friends again quickly."" No one is the boss. They get along because they both see animals in the same way.
""When we travel, we put up our tents every night. But this time we have a camp that stays in one place. We wake up at 5 a.m., so we make tea the night before and keep it hot in a flask.""
They eat pre-packed meals. Whoever is nearby heats the food. Newman says, ""We sometimes work outside for eight weeks. Finding food can be a problem.""
Their life is not easy, but they like being alone in wild places. They can get close to the animals. Newman remembers, ""We filmed a lion family. One lioness often went away. When she came back, she said hello to all the lions. After some time, she also said hello to our car.""
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift'. Two years later, they started working together to film Arctic foxes. Now, they spend four months in each place to make a half-hour film. Before they can start, they must show their plan and get permission.
Newman says, ""Amanda and I worked well together from the beginning. We had the same ideas. We want to make films with a strong feeling. We want to show the true life of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts. If people feel something when they watch, that is better than just making them think.""","In their natural home

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire.
'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is such a tranquil, peaceful place - and here I was rushing around when I could be sitting quietly giving an animal a cuddle. Some of the members of the fashion team seemed quite stressed - my job doesn't really get pressurised. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, it made me laugh to think that I'd usually be cleaning out cages or handling rats. I'm fascinated to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo so I'll stay put.'
Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo.
'I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave thme a green polo shirt instead to work in -which was just as well, as I got very dirty. As I stroked one of the elephants, I reckoned Mandie would probably be packing up clothes in the cupboard. By five o'clock, I stank but I'd had such a brilliant day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants - but maybe in Africa.'
Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went on location with the television gardening programme Ground Force.
'I was extremely excited about meeting the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the programme presenter, was really nice. One of the things I liked was the chance to be in the fresh air. Depending on my shifts, I sometimes never see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was great fun. I thought I was pretty strong but I felt weak compared with the rest of the team. My romantic vision of landscape gardening had not included physical hard work or meticulous planning. I was more an enthusiastic than effective gardener, so I don't plan to give up my other job.'
Charlie Dimmock, landscape gardener with the TV programme Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital.
'I made beds and handed out tablets. I expected to faint when I was doing some jobs, but I amazed myself by finding that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt tremendously 'girlie' compared with my normal male environment. I feel my job is a real waste of time compared with nursing. My day at the hospital was not exactly pleasant but it left me with a great sense of satisfaction.'
Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with the airline Ryanair as a member of the cabin crew.
'I changed into the uniform, and the moment I put it on I felt completely different- people suddenly look up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor told us about safety, what to do if someone had a heart attack-which I knew about from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me and I felt very self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to look after.'
Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with the airline Ryanair, spent the day as a personal trainer in a gym.
'I was dreading doing this swap as I don't do any exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was very surprised at lunch to see that some of the trainers didn't eat ultra-healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this.

Many trees in the Brackham area were brought down in the terrible storms that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had altered the appearance of the town centre entirely, to the annoyance of its more conservative inhabitants.
Among the annoyed, under more normal circumstances, would have been Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force. But at the height of that week's storm, when the wind brought down even the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham had in fact been in no fit state to notice. A large and healthy man, he had for the first time in his life been seriously ill with an attack of bronchitis.
When he first complained of an aching head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, had tried to persuade him to go to the doctor. Convinced that the police force could not do without him, he had, as usual, ignored her and attempted to carry on working. Predictably, though he wouldn't have listened to anyone who tried to tell him so, this had the effect of fogging his memory and shortening his temper.
It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took the initiative and drove him to the doctor's door that he finally gave in. By that time, he didn't have the strength left to argue with her. In no time at all, she was taking him along to the chemist's to get his prescribed antibiotics and then home to his unsurprised wife who sent him straight to bed.
When Molly told him, on the Thursday morning, that the walnut tree had been brought down during the night, Pelham hadn't been able to take it in. On Thursday evening, he had asked weakly about damage to the house, groaned thankfully when he heard there was none, and pulled the sheets over his head.
It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics took effect, his temperature dropped and he got up, that he realised with a shock that the loss of the walnut tree had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The Pelhams' large house stood in a sizeable garden. It had not come cheap, but even so Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The leafy garden had created an impression of privacy. Now, though, the storm had changed his outlook.
Previously, the view from the living-room had featured the handsome walnut tree. This had not darkened the room because there was also a window on the opposite wall, but it had provided interesting patterns of light and shade that disguised the true state of the worn furniture that the family had brought with them from their previous house.
With the tree gone, the room seemed cruelly bright, its worn furnishings exposed in all their shabbiness. And the view from the window didn't bear looking at. The tall house next door, previously hidden by the tree, was now there, dominating the outlook with its unattractive purple bricks and external pipes. It seemed to have a great many upstairs windows, all of them watching the Pelhams' every movement.
'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham croaked to his wife.
But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more pleased than dismayed. 'That's what I've been telling you ever since we came here. We have to buy a new sofa, whatever it costs.'",B2,,"In March, there were very bad storms in the Brackham area. Many trees fell down. In the town, two big trees in the old market square were gone. This changed how the town centre looked. Some people who live there were not happy about this.

One of these people would usually be Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham. He is the head of the local police. But during the worst storm, a large tree fell in his garden. Pelham did not see it happen. He is a big, strong man, but he was very sick. He had a bad chest illness.

First, he said his head hurt and his chest felt bad. His wife, Molly, told him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him. He did not listen to his wife and tried to keep working. But this made him feel worse. He could not remember things well and he became angry easily.

Then, his friend from work, Sergeant Lloyd, drove him to the doctor. Pelham was too tired to say no. Soon, she took him to get his medicine and then home. His wife was not surprised. She told him to go to bed.

On Thursday morning, Molly told him the tree fell down in the night. Pelham did not understand. That evening, he asked if the house was broken. He was happy to hear it was not, and he went back to sleep.

By Saturday, he felt better. He got out of bed. Then he saw the living-room looked very different without the tree. The Pelhams' house is big and has a large garden. It cost a lot of money, but Pelham liked it. The garden with many trees made the house feel private. But the storm changed the view.

Before, you could see a nice tree from the living-room. The room was not dark because there was another window. The tree made nice light and shadow on the furniture. The furniture was old from their last house.

Now, without the tree, the room was very bright. You could see all the old furniture clearly. And the view from the window was bad. The tall house next door was always there, but the tree used to hide it. Now you could see its ugly bricks and pipes. It had many windows upstairs, and it felt like they were all watching the Pelhams.

""Doesn't it look bad?"" Pelham said to his wife.

But Molly, who was standing at the door, did not look sad. She sounded happy. ""I have always said that,"" she answered. ""We need to buy a new sofa, even if it costs a lot of money.""","In March, very bad storms hit the Brackham area and knocked down many trees. In the town, two big lime trees fell in the old market square. Losing these important trees completely changed how the town centre looked. This made some people who liked things the way they were before feel annoyed.

One of these people would usually be Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the local police chief. But during the worst of the storm, when a large walnut tree in his own garden fell, Pelham was too sick to notice. He was a big, strong man, but for the first time in his life, he was very ill with bronchitis.

At first, when he said his head hurt and his chest felt tight, his wife Molly told him to see a doctor. Pelham thought the police needed him too much, so he ignored her and tried to keep working. Of course, this just made him feel worse. It made his memory bad and he became angry very easily.

He only went to the doctor when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, drove him there. By then, he was too weak to say no. Soon, she took him to get his medicine and then home. His wife, who was not surprised, sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen in the night. Pelham was too ill to understand. That evening, he quietly asked if the house was damaged. He was happy to hear it was not, and then he went back to sleep.

By Saturday, his medicine had worked. His fever was gone and he got out of bed. He was shocked to see that losing the walnut tree had changed the living-room forever. The Pelhams' house was big and had a large garden. It was expensive, but Pelham loved it. The garden with all its trees made the house feel private. But the storm had changed the view.

Before, you could see the beautiful walnut tree from the living-room. The room wasn't dark because there was another window on the other side. The tree made pretty patterns of light and shadow. These shadows hid the old, worn furniture they had brought from their last house.

Now, without the tree, the room was too bright. You could see clearly that the furniture was old and in bad condition. And the view from the window was awful. The tall house next door, which the tree used to hide, was now very visible. It had ugly purple bricks and pipes on the outside. It seemed to have many windows upstairs, and Pelham felt like they were all watching his family.

'It looks terrible, doesn't it?' Pelham said to his wife, his voice still rough from being ill.

But Molly, who was standing at the door, didn't seem upset. She sounded happy. 'That's what I have been saying since we moved here,' she said. 'We must buy a new sofa, no matter how much it costs.'",,,
129,"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain.

Kendra Slawinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park.
I was surprised to hear about her training venue.
'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 'I'm too involved in what I'm doing concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else,' she said.'I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.'
'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them. These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part.
'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.'
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the opening ceremony. As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.'
The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra.But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.' 
Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing.
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra.
As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.'
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned.
Doubtless she will coach young players in the future, but at the moment her eyes are firmly set on her last big event. As she leads out her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is more than likely to have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be behind her every step of the way.",B2,,"The Netball Captain

In our stories about women in sport, Suzie Ellis met the captain of England's netball team.

Kendra Slawinski is the captain. When I met her, she had a busy day. She is getting ready for the World Championships next month. She taught at a school, then trained in a supermarket car park.

I was surprised about the training place.
""Do people look at you?"" I asked.
""I only think about my training,"" she said. ""Sometimes I see cars go slow, but that's all.""

""Now I want to be my best for the Championships,"" says Kendra. ""I follow a strict plan to be very fit."" This is her fourth World Championships. It will be the biggest one, with 27 countries playing.

""Our home fans will support us,"" she says. ""That is very special. More people in this country should like netball. Because we play here, people expect more from us. They want us to play well.""

Their first game is against Barbados after the opening ceremony. ""We always beat them before, but they are good to play. They are a good team.""

England is the fourth best team in the world. But the World Championships will be hard. ""You must try hard every day. There is no rest between games. You have only one chance, so you must be ready.""

Kendra has played for 15 years. The sport is now faster. Players are stronger. ""We train to win,"" says Kendra. ""But after the game, we are friends again.""

Netball now uses science to help players get fit.
""We must all think and train like the best players,"" says Kendra.

As captain, she wants to be strong and show the team how to play well. ""My job is to help the team.""

""My netball life was always planned,"" she says. ""I decided this will be my last time playing.""

She will probably teach young players later, but now she only thinks about this big event. When she walks with her team at the opening ceremony, she might cry. Her fans will be with her all the way.","The Netball Captain

Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion.
Ned Ingham: Dress Designer
Ned Ingham makes dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional, rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles,' he explains. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes. But you do not have to be a bride to own an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses, given a fresh touch by up-to-the-minute colours and fabrics. For the less adventurous, Ingham's designs include a classic summer navy-blue suit, the centrepiece of the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century. But in his hands, it looks as new as tomorrow.
Sally Quail: Jeweller
Although she once worked for an art dealer, Sally Quail has had no formal training in jewellery. It was only when she could not find an engagement ring she liked that she decided to design her own. The resulting enquiries encouraged her to set up as a designer in 1990. Now her pieces are sought out by many stars of stage and screen. Her signature style is large semi-precious stones set in gold to make magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings fashioned after those worn in the 18th century. However, she has recently begun to use the most precious stone of all - diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36- year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond and that is when I began working with them.'
Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer
Just four years after setting up in the fiercely competitive fashion business, Lily Grimson, with only an introductory course in art and design behind her, has had two of her creations selected for a major design exhibition. Whatever the shape and form of her designs, they are never ignored. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK.
The Grimson handbag is not simply a container - the bags are full of glamour, whether fashioned from the finest calfskin or the heaviest silk. A combination of chic and care makes a Grimson bag something special.
Peter Little: Hairdresser
For over 20 years, Peter Little has taken his scissors to some of the world's top heads. Everyone who is anyone has had their hair styled by this man. 'Most women want real-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. So his approach is a novel one - to ensure that his clients never appear as if they have just walked out of a salon. But this carefree attitude and casual look does not come cheap - PS250 for the first appointment, and there's a three-month waiting list. Trading on his celebrity, Peter has produced his own range of hairdryers and other styling equipment. Now, those who can't make it to his salon can create their own styles back at home.
Penny Pratt: Florist
In addition to running her tiny shop, Penny Pratt is a flower consultant for a large chain of supermarkets and provides floral ideas to a number of top restaurants. All of this is good going for someone who has no floristry qualifications and gave up her job as a teacher 10 years ago in order to do 'something different'. And her simple, yet incredibly modern, creations have begun to capture every design prize in the flower business, which has helped her in setting up her own London Flower School. She has recently combined her skills on extremely successful lecture trips to Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are much simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong and don't have too many leaves - they are too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, whatever your arrangements, the golden rule remains: the flowers must be of the same species.'

131,"Living in the valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.
It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills.
Soon snow began to fall. Within a day it lay some 15 centimetres deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. Up there the wind blasted fiercely. Deep in our valley we felt only sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed but the branches held firm.
And yet we knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have occurred if circumstances had been different, if the flow of water from the hills had not, many years before, been controlled, held back by a series of dams.
In a short time the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched furious clouds pile up high over the hills to the west. Sinister grey clouds extended over the valleys. They twisted and turned, rising eastwards and upwards, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which every day was becoming fuller and wilder.
The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds, but high up in the hills the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. And then it happened - for the first time in years the reservoir overflowed. There in the heights it was like the Niagara Falls, as the water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. 
The river seemed maddened as the waters poured almost horizontally down to its lower stretches. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside.
On many occasions through the centuries before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in just such a rage. Now, though, the dam restricts the flow of the river and usually all is well; the great mass of water from the hills, the product of snow and torrential rain, remains behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley, and can be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.",B2,,"We lived in our valley for sixteen months. Then we learned about the dangers in the hills. These dangers could hurt us.

That year, big storms came early. It was not yet winter. It was not even the end of November. Before this, we felt safe in our valley under the hills.

Soon, it started to snow. In one day, the snow was 15 centimetres deep. It almost blocked our small road. It made the path by the stream very slippery. On the high hills, the snow was deeper. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we only felt strong winds. The trees moved, but the branches did not break.

But we had a reason to be afraid. The snow and wind were a problem, but they did not scare us much. The real danger was the river, the Ryburn. It is usually a calm river, but now it was dangerous. It made us think about the past. Many years ago, people built dams to stop the water from the hills.

Then, the snow began to melt. Every day, we saw dark, angry clouds over the hills. The grey clouds were over the valleys. They moved and grew. This was a warning. We looked at the sky. Then we watched the river. It was getting bigger and wilder every day.

The rain washed the snow away. More and more rain fell. High in the hills, the reservoir was filling with water. It was almost too full. Then it happened. For the first time in years, the water went over the top of the dam. It was like a big waterfall. The water poured into the stream below.

The water rushed down the river. Near our small house, the stream was wild under the bridge. The water was much deeper than before. It hit the sides of the river hard. For three days, we hoped the water would not go over the wall. Luckily, the dam was strong. The water level started to go down.

Many years ago, before the dam, the river often flooded the villages near it. Now, the dam controls the river. Usually, everything is okay. The water from the hills, from snow and rain, stays behind the dam. It only goes over the top sometimes.

Because of the dam, we are not afraid of the big clouds. We can enjoy seeing the strong river. We feel our home in the valley is safe.","Living in the valley

We had lived in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers in the hills around us. These dangers could put our lives at risk.

That year, big storms came early, before winter had even started. It was still November. Before that time, we always felt safe and protected in our valley under the hills.

Soon, snow started to fall. After one day, it was about 15 centimetres deep. It almost blocked our small road and made the path next to the stream very slippery. But on the higher hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. Up there, the wind was very strong. Down in our valley, we only felt strong winds sometimes. The trees moved, but their branches did not break.

Still, we knew we had a reason to be worried. The snow and wind were a problem, but they did not really scare us. It was the river, the Ryburn, that worried us most. It usually flows very calmly. The river made us think about what could have happened if things were different. Many years ago, people built dams to control the water coming from the hills.

After a short time, the snow began to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds gathering over the hills in the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys. They moved and rose, warning us about what was coming. We had watched the sky enough; now we started to watch the river. It was getting fuller and wilder every day.

The snow disappeared as more and more rain fell from the clouds. High in the hills, the reservoir was filling up and getting close to a dangerous level. Then it happened — for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. Up in the hills, it looked like a huge waterfall as the water rushed over the top of the dam and into the stream below.

The river seemed crazy as the water rushed down. Very close to our house, the stream was wild under the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it near our home, hitting the sides angrily. For three days, we hoped it would not go over its walls. Luckily, the dam was strong, and the water level started to go down.

Many times in the past, before the dam was built, the river flooded nearby villages when it was this wild. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually everything is fine. Most of the water from the hills — from snow and heavy rain — stays behind the dam. Only sometimes does it overflow. Because of this, we can enjoy the big clouds above the valley instead of being afraid. We can admire the great power of the river. Thanks to this protection, we still feel our home in the valley is safe.",,,
132,"Confident people what's their secret?

Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it.

A Jenny

When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course.
There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place.

B Michaela

It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself.
If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears!

C Lisa

People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. Interviewing people has helped me realise that most - if not all - of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we speak to someone who's genuinely friendly. The best ever piece of advice came from my mother when I was agonising as a teenager about wearing the right clothes. She simply cried, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too busy worrying about how they look.' I've found that's well worth remembering.
I also think you gain confidence by tackling things that scare you. When I took my driving test I was so nervous, but I passed. After that I felt sure that I'd never feel so frightened again, and I never have.

D Barbara

My confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work I do, but it's something that I've built up over the years. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round. I work hard and I'm popular in the restaurant, but it's probable that one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that affect me. You've got to like yourself for what you are, not try to be what others expect.
My company runs a lot of training courses, and going on those has built up my self-esteem. The company also encourages employees to set manageable targets. It helps no end if you can see you're achieving something tangible, rather than reaching for the stars all at once, and ending up with nothing but air!

E Kim

After I left college I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing with what was being said, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I summoned up the confidence to start making my point. Even so, when I first worked in politics, I'd never spoken in public before and always used to shake like a leaf. I would say to myself, 'Don't be so silly. People do this every day of their lives, so there's no reason why you can't.' I also found it helpful to jot a few things down to refer to - rather like having a comfort blanket!
I don't think there is anyone who isn't a little shaky when it comes to talking publicly. The real secret of confidence lies in telling yourself over and over again, 'Nothing is impossible.'",B2,,,"What is the secret of confident people?

People think I am very confident, but the truth is, the calmer I look, the more scared I am inside. I had to learn to look confident because it is very important in TV work. Interviewing people has shown me that almost everyone feels nervous in important situations. We feel better when we talk to someone who is kind.
The best advice I got was from my mother when I was a teenager worrying about my clothes. She said, ""Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves."" I always remember that.
I also think you become more confident by doing things that scare you. When I took my driving test I was very nervous, but I passed. After that, I felt sure I would never be that frightened again, and I haven't been.

**D Barbara**

My confidence comes from really liking my work, but I have built it up over many years. If you just do your work and learn from your mistakes, you feel more confident next time. I work hard and most people in the restaurant like me, but probably one in ten people does not. I don't let that bother me. You have to like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others want.
My company has many training courses, and going to them has made me feel better about myself. The company also tells us to set goals we can reach. It really helps when you can see you are achieving something real, instead of trying to do everything at once and failing.

**E Kim**

After college, I worked for years as a secretary. In meetings, I did not always agree with what was said, but I was too afraid to speak. Finally, I found the courage to say what I thought. Still, when I first worked in politics, I had never spoken in public and I always shook with fear. I would tell myself, ""Don't be silly. People do this every day, so you can do it too."" I also found it useful to write down a few notes to look at - it made me feel safe.
I think everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The real secret of confidence is to keep telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible.""",,,
133,"THE SHELL ARTIST

At the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.

There are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list. For the moment though, he will stick to the skill that he has been delighted to perfect over the past ten years: making delicate and unusual objects out of shells.
'Tell me if I am boring you,' he says, as he leads me round his apartment showing me his work. There is a fine line between being a bore and being an enthusiast, but Cooke need not worry: he fits into the latter category, helped both by his charm and by the beauty of the things he makes.
He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. 'I shan't be at all bothered if people don't buy them because I have got so used to them, and to me they're adorable. I never meant to sell my work commercially. Some friends came to see me about five years ago and said, ""You must have an exhibition - people ought to see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery"".' The result was an exhibition in London, at which 70 per cent of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the enormous prices the pieces command - around PS2,000 for the ornaments an empty space above the fireplace would seem a small sacrifice for Cooke to make.
There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at PS225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists that he has nothing to do with the prices and is cheerily open about their level: he claims there is nobody else in the world who produces work like his, and, as the gallery-owner told him, 'Well, you're going to stop one day and everybody will want your pieces because there won't be any more.'
'I do wish, though,' says Cooke, 'that I'd taken this up a lot earlier, because then I would have been able to produce really wonderful things - at least the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing the best I can now, I'm more limited physically than I was when I started.' Still, the work that he has managed to produce is a long way from the common shell constructions that can be found in seaside shops. 'I have a miniature mind,' he says, and this has resulted in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.
Cooke has created his own method and uses materials as and when he finds them. He uses the cardboard sent back with laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker ('If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!') and washing-up liquid to wash the shells. 'I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,' he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, colour gradations and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.
Cooke's quest for beautiful, and especially tiny, shells has taken him further than his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa and the Philippines, to name but a few of the beaches where he has lain on his stomach and looked for beauties to bring home. He is insistent that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who write him letters accusing him of stripping the world's beaches. 'When I am collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why should I not collect them?' If one bases this argument on the amount of luggage that can be carried home by one man, the sum beauty of whose work is often greater than its natural parts, it becomes very convincing indeed.",B2,,"Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is very good at making art from shells.

He would like to try other things, like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he will keep making beautiful and special things from shells. He has been doing this for ten years and loves it.

He shows me his apartment and his work. He is a very interesting person, not boring at all. He is full of energy and makes lovely things.

He shows me two shell decorations above his fireplace. He says he doesn't mind if people don't buy them because he likes them so much. He never planned to sell his work. But some friends saw his art five years ago and said he should have an exhibition so people could see it. They spoke to a man with an art gallery. His first exhibition was in London, and 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition started yesterday. His art is very expensive. The two decorations cost about £2,000.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition. The cheapest is a shell flower in a glass vase for £225. Peter says he doesn't decide the prices. He says he is the only person in the world who makes art like this. The gallery owner told him that one day he will stop, and then everyone will want his pieces because there won't be any more.

Peter says, ""I wish I started this much earlier. Then I could have made even more wonderful things. I have the ideas, but my body is not as strong as before."" Still, his work is very different from the simple shell art you find in seaside shops. He says, ""I like small things."" He makes small boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures from shells, and baskets of flowers that look very real.

Peter makes his art his own way. He uses things he finds. He uses cardboard from the laundry for his flowers. He uses a special glue and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says he knows what he wants to make, and then he makes it. His work shows he is very careful with details, colours, and making things the same on both sides.

Peter looks for beautiful, small shells on beaches. He has been to many countries like France, Thailand, and Mexico to find them. He says he only collects shells that are empty. Some people write to him and say he is taking too many shells from beaches. But he says, ""When I am collecting, I see people walking on shells and breaking them. The sea also breaks the shells. I never take shells with animals living inside. I only take empty shells. Why shouldn't I take them?"" When you think about how much one person can carry, and that his art is more beautiful than the shells alone, his idea makes good sense.","Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is now very good at his art.

There are still many things Peter Cooke would like to try, like making paper and working with feathers. But for now, he will continue with the skill he has enjoyed getting better at for the last ten years: making beautiful and unusual things from shells.

""Tell me if I am boring you,"" he says, while he shows me his work in his home. It can be hard to know if someone is boring or just very interested in something, but Cooke does not need to worry. He is very interesting because he is charming and his work is beautiful.

He shows me two shell-covered objects above a fireplace. ""I won't be sad if people don't buy them because I am used to them and I love them. I never planned to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends visited and said, 'You must show your work to people. We will speak to a man who has an art gallery.'"" The result was an exhibition in London where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. His pieces are very expensive – the two objects above the fireplace cost about £2,000. For Cooke, having an empty space there would not be a problem.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition. The cheapest is a shell-flower in a glass vase for £225. Cooke says he does not decide the prices. He is happy to talk about why they are so high: he says no one else in the world makes work like his. The gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there will be no more.""

""I do wish,"" says Cooke, ""that I had started this much earlier. Then I could have made really amazing things. The ideas are still there and I try my best now, but my body is not as strong as when I started."" Still, his work is very different from the simple shell art you find in seaside shops. ""I like small things,"" he says. This is why he makes boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, small pictures made from shells, and baskets of flowers that look very real.

Cooke has his own way of working and uses materials when he finds them. He uses cardboard from the laundry for his flower bases, a special glue he buys in large amounts, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I know what I want to make, and it just happens,"" he says about his work. But the small details, the changing colours, and the balance in his pieces show it is not by accident.

Cooke looks for beautiful, especially small, shells. He goes further than the beach near his home in Norfolk. He has been to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. On these beaches, he lies down and looks for beautiful shells to take home. He says he only collects shells that are already empty. Some people write to him and say he is taking too many shells from beaches. He answers, ""When I collect shells, I hear people walking on them and breaking them much faster than I can collect them. The sea breaks the shells that are left. I would never take shells with living animals inside. But if the shell is empty, why can't I collect it?"" When you think about how much one person can carry home, and how his art is often more beautiful than the shells were in nature, his argument is very strong.",,,
134,"Five-star luxury meets up-to-date technology
The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of considerable research into customer requirements and nearly two years' work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike.
At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel.
Though the system cost PS250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers.
For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences.
Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort. Guests have the opportunity to change the temperature themselves within three degrees either side of the normal l8degC but, in addition, each individual room can be adjusted by any amount between 14degC and 25degC at the front desk.
For guests, though, it is the other technology offered in their rooms which is most likely to find favour. This is particularly true for the business user, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five per cent of his business will come from this part of the market. To provide the best service for such needs, the hotel has taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms. Each one has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.
Technology changes so quickly these days that the hotel has had to try to forecast possible improvements. Extra cables have been laid to handle whatever scientific advances may occur. The televisions are rented rather than bought, so that they can be replaced with more up-to- date models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.
Despite the presence of all this very up-to-the-minute equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried hard not to make guests feel threatened by technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms, large and well-furnished, are both comfortable and welcoming. There are, of course, a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars and two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the heart of it all.
As at all luxury hotels, the food that is offered to guests must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he agreed to move his restaurant business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel site has huge benefits, both for him and the hotel itself. He has been able to design a new kitchen and take it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at the previous address, too. From the hotel's side, they are able to offer a popular and successful place to eat, with no financial risks attached. Aided by technology and a highly capable staff, the Merrion looks likely to succeed.

Another system controls the room temperature. Guests can change the temperature a little. The hotel can also change it for them.

Guests like the technology in their rooms. This is important for business guests. MacCann thinks many guests will be business people. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-call system. The fax machine can also copy and print.

135,"The kingfisher

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers,feeding on fish.
Old trees overhang the stream, half shading shallow water. Soft greens, mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours, as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast, a slice of light and motion so striking you almost feel it. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers, its power out of proportion to its size.
Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. A sure sign of his depth of feeling for this little bird is his inability to identify just what it is that draws him to it. After all, it is the stuff of legend. Greek myth makes the kingfisher a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another tale tells how the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body took on the blue of the sky,while its underparts were scorched by the sun.
There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue.
This is why a kingfisher may appear to change from bright blue to rich emerald green with only a slight change in the angle at which light falls on it. It's small wonder that some wildlife photographers get so enthusiastic about them. Couple the colours with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of direct human approach, can be easy to watch from a hideout, and you have a recipe for a lifelong passion.
Charlie Jame's first hideout was an old blanket which he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favourite spot. The bird came back within minutes and sat only a metre away. But it took another four years, he reckons, before he got his first decent picture. In the meantime, the European kingfisher had begun to dominate his life. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream.
The trouble was, school cut the time available to be with the birds. So he missed lessons, becoming what he describes as an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only member of its cosmopolitan family to breed in Europe, was getting noticed.
At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman. What he'd really like to do now is make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech,just beautiful images which say it all,' he says. 'I'm attracted to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings ...'
The sentence trails off to nothing. He's thinking of those colours of the bird he's spent more than half his life close to, yet which still excites interest. The photographs succeed in communicating something of his feelings. But, as Charlie knows, there's so much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can ever show.",B2,,"The kingfisher

Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. It is a beautiful blue-green bird. It lives near rivers and eats fish.

Old trees grow over the river. They make shade on the water. The colours are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sun. The sounds of the water are soft, too. Then the kingfisher flies by. It moves very fast and straight, like a light. It is gone in a second, but you remember it.

Charlie loved kingfishers when he was young. He cannot say exactly why he loves this little bird so much. There are old stories about kingfishers. One Greek story says a moon goddess became a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew too near the sun. Its stomach got burned, and its back turned blue from the sky.

This story has some truth. Kingfisher feathers are not really blue. The top feathers are made in a special way. They reflect light and look blue.

When the light changes, the kingfisher can look bright blue or green. This is why wildlife photographers like them so much. Kingfishers do not like people, but you can watch them from a hiding place. This makes people love them for life.

Charlie’s first hiding place was an old blanket over his head. He waited near the river. The kingfisher came back quickly and sat very near him. But it took four more years to get a good photo. By then, the kingfisher was the most important thing in his life. He spent all his free time by the river.

But school took his time away from the birds. He missed lessons and did not do well in school. Still, people noticed his love for this bird. The European kingfisher is the only kind that lives in Europe.

When he was 16, a nature magazine gave him a job. Later, he worked as an assistant for the magazine’s editor. Then he became a wildlife film cameraman. Now he wants to make the best kingfisher film. He says, ""No talking, just beautiful pictures. I like simple things. I like to take photos of kingfisher wings...""

He stops talking. He is thinking about the bird’s colours. He has been near kingfishers for more than half his life, and they still make him happy. His photos show some of his feelings. But Charlie knows his work cannot show everything he feels for the kingfisher.","The kingfisher

Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish.

Old trees hang over the stream, making the shallow water partly dark. The main colours are soft greens, mud browns, and different yellows from the sun. The sounds of the water in the wind are soft. The bird flies through this scene like a laser, very straight and fast. It is a flash of light and movement that is so strong you almost feel it. It is gone in a second, but you remember the picture. It is a very powerful little bird.

Charlie James started to love kingfishers when he was young. You can tell how much he loves this little bird because he cannot say exactly why he likes it so much. The bird is also part of old stories. One Greek story says the kingfisher was a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top half became the colour of the sky and its bottom half was burned by the sun.

There is some science in that story. Even though kingfishers look blue, their feathers have no blue colour in them. Instead, the shape of their top feathers breaks the light and reflects blue.

This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue and then emerald green when the light hits it from a different angle. It is no surprise that some wildlife photographers love them so much. The colours are amazing, and even though kingfishers do not like people coming close, you can watch them easily from a hiding place. This is a good reason for a lifelong interest.

The problem was that school meant he had less time to be with the birds. So he did not go to some lessons, and he says he became 'bad at school'. But people started to notice his interest in this bird. It is the most common kingfisher in the world and the only one from its bird family that has babies in Europe.

When he was 16, a nature magazine asked him to be an advisor. Then he worked as an assistant to the magazine's editor. Later, he slowly started to work for himself, filming wildlife. Now, what he really wants to do is make the best kingfisher film ever. 'No talking, just beautiful pictures that tell the story,' he says. 'I like the simple way.

The hotel was made by joining four large old houses in Dublin. This took almost two years. Because the hotel is new, it was possible to install the latest technology. This helps both the staff and the guests.

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know guests by their names. But for details about what guests like, he uses the hotel's computer system. This system helps the hotel treat returning guests in a special way, which is important for a five-star hotel.

The system cost a lot of money to install, but MacCann says it will pay for itself over time. He is very happy with how well it works and the things it can do.

For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, the same CDs will be ready for them when they come back. This is because of a special computer feature that lets staff record guests' preferences.

Hotel guests everywhere often complain about room temperature. Another modern system controls the temperature in the rooms. Guests can change the temperature a little themselves, but the front desk can also adjust it for each room.

Guests will probably like the other technology in their rooms the most. This is especially true for business guests. MacCann thinks up to sixty-five percent of his business will come from them. To help these guests, the hotel has put business centre equipment in every bedroom. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a machine that works as a fax, photocopier, and printer, and a video-conferencing system.

Technology changes very fast, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have added extra cables for new technology that may come. The televisions are rented, not bought, so they can be changed for newer models anytime. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed.

Even with all this modern equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried to make sure guests do not feel uncomfortable with the technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms are large, well-furnished, and feel comfortable and welcoming. The hotel also has a swimming pool, a gym, six meeting rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden in the middle.

As in all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he decided to move his restaurant to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel is very good for him and for the hotel. He was able to design a new, modern kitchen. There is also better parking than at his old place. For the hotel, they can offer a famous and successful restaurant without any financial risk. With modern technology and a very good staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be a success.",,,
137,"Film Critic

Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page.
Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff.
At first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable.
It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time: a new newspaper, and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. In fact, the first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of my reviews appeared, I didn't know where to look.
Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film.
The luxury of this way of working suits me well. I wouldn't have been interested in the more standard film critic's role, which involves considering every film that comes out. That's a routine that would make me stale in no time at all. I would soon be sinking into my seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What insulting rubbish must I sit through now?' - a style of sigh that can often be heard in screening rooms around the world.
The space I am given allows me to broaden my argument - or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. There is also such a thing as loyalty to 'type' or its opposite. It can only rarely happen that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story addict avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say.
So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be.",B2,"My name is Mark Adams. I write about movies for a newspaper. I have done this for ten years.

My first job was writing about movies for The Front Page newspaper. Before that, I wrote a little about books and movies for other places. I also worked for the radio. At the radio, I met Tom Seaton. He was the boss at The Front Page. He gave me the job.

Tom wanted a group of people to write about books, TV, plays, movies, and radio. We planned to eat lunch every week. We would talk about our work. We would also have other people with us.

I was very happy to get this job. I did not feel good about myself. One day, I saw a person on the train. The person was reading my story in the newspaper. I felt very shy.

Tom's plan for a group of writers did not work. It was a good idea, but we did not meet. We talked on the phone. People like one writer for one thing. So, I chose to write only about movies. Now, I write one long story about a movie every week.

I like my job. I do not write about every new movie. If I wrote about every new movie, I would not like my job. I would get tired.

I have a lot of space to write. Sometimes, there is not much to say. Then I must find something to write. But what is my job for the people who read? I think people choose a movie because of the famous actors. They choose because of the story. They do not often choose a movie because of my writing.

So, what is my writing for? I do not need to be right about a movie. I do not need to say some movies are good and some are bad. I just need to say what I think. I am not a judge. I do not want to be a judge.",,"Film Critic

Mark Adams remembers his last ten years as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page.
Writing about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I did some small review jobs - books for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and different things for the radio. That is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. He also wrote for radio and TV. He gave me the job, but Tom was not really a journalist. If he was, he would have chosen his team more carefully.

At first, his plan was to have a team of critics write about art that didn't need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch. At the lunch, we would choose what to write about from the things Tom picked for us. There would also be guests to make it friendly.

At that time, it all felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed impossible that a new paper could succeed when there were already so many. It seemed as unlikely as a millionaire wanting to help me and pretending to give me a job. I had so little confidence. In fact, the first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, and then turning to a page with one of my reviews, I felt very shy.

Tom's first idea for a team of arts critics didn't work. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so we did everything by phone. It also turned out that people liked to connect a reviewer with just one topic, so I chose film. But without Tom's first idea, we probably wouldn't have the system we have now, where I write one long article each week, usually about one film.

This way of working is great for me. I wouldn't like the usual film critic's job, which means watching every new film. That routine would make me bored very quickly. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning, thinking, 'What bad film must I watch now?' - a thought you can often hear in film screening rooms everywhere.

The space I get lets me write more about my ideas - or, on a boring week, it makes me try to write about nothing much. But what is my job for the public? I think people choose which films to see because of the famous actors, the advertising, or the director. People also like certain types of films, or they don't. It probably doesn't happen often that someone who hates westerns goes to see one after reading a review, or that someone who loves love stories avoids one because of a newspaper article.

So if a film review isn't really advice for what to see, what is it? I don't feel I must be 'correct' about a film. I also don't think there needs to be a fixed number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I need to do is share my opinion. I am not a judge, and I don't want to be one.",,,
138,"Fun at the Dentist's?

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch which patients sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.'.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. 'We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. 'One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself', he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder. The surgery seems more like an elegant beauty parlour than a mainstream dental practice.",B2,,"A Fun Time at the Dentist?

When you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you see colorful new paintings and a nice blue chair. Patients sit in the chair while he looks at their teeth. Jerome says, ""Many people only visit the dentist when their teeth hurt. They don't go for regular visits because they are scared.""

To help people feel less scared, he has made his office a comfortable place. He says, ""I don't wear a white coat because people connect it with pain. I believe dental care should be relaxing and even fun.""

This is very different for most of us, who think of the dentist as something painful or serious. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and happy, they will forget their bad past experiences.""

He uses virtual-reality headsets to help patients relax. ""We were the first in Britain to use these. Patients wear the headset and watch a film about fish while I check their teeth. Then, they can see inside their own mouth with a special camera."" Most patients like this part of their visit.

Also, his office smells nice, like oranges, not like a normal dentist. Jerome says, ""Smell is important. The usual dentist smell can make scared people feel nervous."" I thought the orange smell was very nice.

Jerome is a popular dentist, but he says his work is very important. The relaxing methods help, but good dental care is the most important thing.

For example, he uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth. It feels strange at first, but it doesn't hurt if you are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the USA to learn about new dental methods. He says, ""When you make things easier for the patient, you make things easier for yourself."" He thinks dentists in Britain should be less formal and more focused on patients.

Just then, a patient arrives. Jerome welcomes him, offers him tea, and asks what film he wants to watch. The patient looks happy. The office feels more like a nice beauty shop than a normal dentist's office.","A Fun Visit to the Dentist?

When you go to W. Lloyd Jerome’s dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright, modern paintings on the walls. There is also a comfortable blue sofa where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Half of people only go to the dentist when they have pain, not for regular visits. This is because they are scared.'

To help with this, he has made his office a place where people feel less afraid. 'I decided not to wear a white coat,' he says. 'People often connect white coats with pain. I believe that dental care should be relaxing, interesting, and even fun.'

This is very surprising for many of us who think of the dentist as something painful or very serious. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed and happy, and they get good care, they will forget their bad past experiences.'

One way he helps people relax is with virtual-reality headsets. 'We were the first in Britain to use them, and patients like them a lot,' he says. 'During the first check-up, the patient sits on the blue sofa and watches a film about sea life. Then, the headset shows a special camera view inside their mouth.' Most patients actually enjoy this part of the visit.

Also, the office smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today it smells of oranges. Jerome explains, 'I want people to feel with all their senses that this is not a usual dentist’s. Smell is important. The smell of medicine can make nervous people feel scared quickly.' I thought the orange smell was very nice.

Even though he is known as Glasgow’s most stylish dentist, Jerome says his work is very important. Relaxing the patient is helpful, but good treatment is the most important thing.

For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a little strange at first, but if you are relaxed, it does not hurt.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental methods. He says, 'I learned that when you make things easier for the patient, it is easier for you too.' He believes that putting the patient first is the start of a change in British dentistry.

Just then, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly offers him tea—herbal or normal—asks what video he wants to watch, and leads him kindly to the chair. The patient looks happy with this special treatment. The office feels more like a nice beauty salon than a normal dentist’s.",,,
139,"Variations on a Theme

If you're thinking of taking children to a theme park, there are dozens to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to test the best.
Fun Island - The Burns family
Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. In fact, we were impressed. The park tries hard to cater for younger children, so our three-year-old didn't feel left out. The kids all loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's a special dodgems ride for the very young kids, which was a great success. For older children, there are scarier rides, such as Splash Out, where you end up jumping in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to call it a day, but the children objected because they were having such fun. Our only criticism would be that the park is slightly lacking in atmosphere, and the scenery leaves something to be desired. But the staff are extremely helpful and we felt it was clean, well organised and very security-conscious.
Wonderland - The McMillan family
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he adored it. He was in heaven on the Mountain Train, and particularly liked Little Land, with its small replicas of famous buildings that were at his level! The older children enjoyed the ferris wheel, and loved driving the toy cars on a proper road layout. We spent six hours there and were glad that there were places where you could put your feet up. The landscaping is perfect and the staff very helpful and friendly. And there's something for everyone, adults included.
Adventure World - The Jeffree family
After seven hours we felt there was still a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a fantastic trapeze act and kept us on the edge of our seats. We went on the Terror Line and, although the girls were rather scared and kept their eyes shut most of the time, they said they'd enjoyed it. Their favourite ride was Running River, where you think you're going to get soaked, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The children had a look at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we breathed a sigh of relief when they found that they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even queuing for rides isn't too boring. It's spotlessly clean, and the staff are great. On one ride I couldn't sit with both girls, so a member of staff offered to go with one of them.
The Great Park - The Langridge family
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a super theme park for younger children because the rides aren't too terrifying. I'm a real coward but even I enjoyed myself. We all adored Exotic Travels, a boat ride which starts off quite tamely and then becomes terrific fun. We queued for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over before we knew it! I wouldn't go on the Big Leap, but if you have the nerve, it looked great. If the children had been a little older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were all in the right age group and they loved it.
Fantasy World - The Break-all family
According to the park's advertising there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we certainly felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, dominates the skyline, and Ben thought it was the most terrifying of the rides, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres above the ground, was even worse! There are a dozen or so main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a couple of them, but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes were mixed. Some of them were great with the younger children, but the welcome wasn't always as warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared tell the kids we were going home early.
",B2,,"Theme Parks in Britain

If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many in Britain. We asked five families to visit the best ones.

They were having so much fun. We think the park could feel more exciting and look nicer. But the staff were very kind and helpful. The park was clean, well organised and safe.

Wonderland - The McMillan family
This was our first time at a theme park. We did not know what it would be like. We thought Oscar was too young, but he loved it. He really enjoyed the Mountain Train and Little Land. Little Land has small copies of famous buildings that are just right for his size. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a small road. We stayed for six hours. We were happy there were places to sit and rest. The park is very beautiful. The staff were helpful and friendly. There is fun for everyone, even adults.

Adventure World - The Jeffree family
After seven hours, we still had more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus. The trapeze show was exciting. We went on the Terror Line ride. The girls were a little scared and closed their eyes, but they said they liked it. Their favourite ride was Running River. You think you will get very wet, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great. The children saw the new ride, Fear Factor, but they were too small to go on it. We were happy about that! The park is designed well. Waiting for rides is not too boring. It is very clean. The staff are great. On one ride, I could not sit with both my girls. A staff member went with one of them.

The Great Park - The Langridge family
We arrived at one o'clock. The park closed at 5 p.m., which was too early. This is a very good theme park for young children because the rides are not too scary. I am not brave, but I had fun too. We all loved Exotic Travels. It is a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very fun. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River. The ride finished very quickly! I did not go on the Big Leap, but it looked great for brave people. If our children were older, they might think the park is not exciting enough. But they are the right age and they loved it.

Fantasy World - The Break-all family
The park's advertising says there is 'No Limit to the Fun'. We think that is true. You can see Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket. Ben thought it was the most scary ride. Jennie said the Hanger was even worse! On the Hanger, you go upside-down high in the air. There are about twelve main rides. The older children went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides, but she liked the Long Slide. Some staff were very good with young children. But some were not very friendly. You need a whole day at Fantasy World.

140,"An eye for detail
Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.
With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently. She now employs an extra gardener but, despite the need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.",B2,,"An eye for detail

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The big garden around her house has many of the flowers she paints. It is full of her favourite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. The two long flower borders next to the path look very nice together. The people who lived here before were good gardeners. They left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. ""It was really his garden,"" she says. ""We were good friends. At first, he did not like some of my ideas. But when I said I wanted to paint the flowers, he understood.""

Susan likes to paint single plants in detail. She does not usually paint the whole garden. Sometimes she paints plants where they grow. But more often, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't paint everything at once,"" she says. ""I paint one flower, which can take a few days. Then I add another flower. I build the painting like this. Sometimes it takes two years to finish.""

Spring and early summer are her busiest times. This is when the tulips and then the poppies are out. ""They all come out together, and you are very busy,"" she says. But she also likes how the flowers change and get old. For example, with tulips: ""You put them in water. After a day, they change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. At first, they look boring in a vase, but they are always moving and changing.""

Susan has always liked plants. ""I studied plants at school and I collected wild flowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I did not like garden flowers then. I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic flowers. I thought only wild flowers were real. I liked how they grew in difficult places, like in cracks in rocks."" Now, her garden has plants from far-away countries. They grow well in her garden, like they did in China or the Himalayas. She is relaxed about the garden. She is like a kind aunt who lets children play freely, if they don't break anything.

Susan is getting ready for two art shows. With so many flowers to paint near her door, it is hard to find time for gardening. She has another gardener to help now. But she knows that to feel close to her flowers, she still needs to work in the garden herself.","An eye for detail

Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her paintings of flowers. The large garden around her house provides many of the flowers she paints. It is filled with her favourite flowers, especially different kinds of tulips and poppies. Some plants grow freely and spread all over the garden.

Much of this is thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept their gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got on very well. At first, he didn't think some of my ideas for new plants were good. But when I explained I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed pictures of single plants rather than the whole garden. Sometimes she paints groups of plants where they are growing, but usually she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't create the whole painting at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I add another flower and slowly build the painting. Sometimes it takes two years to finish one.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer, when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all appear at the same time, and you have so much to do,"" she says. However, she also finds it interesting to watch the flowers slowly decay. For example, with tulips, ""you put them in water and after a day they each form different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem boring, but they keep changing with interesting twists and turns.""

Susan has always been interested in plants. ""I studied botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't very interested in gardening then. Actually, I didn't like garden flowers because I thought they looked artificial, like the silk or plastic flowers sold in shops. To me, only wild flowers were real. I was fascinated by how they managed to grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs."" Today, her garden contains many plants that originally came from distant countries, but they grow well here. She has a relaxed attitude towards the garden, similar to a kind aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious damage.

With two exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of flowers to paint near her home, Susan has found little time recently to work in the garden. She has hired another gardener to help. But although she needs to focus on painting, she believes that to stay connected to her subjects, she must still work in the garden herself.",,,
141,"An eye for detail

Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.
With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently. She now employs an extra gardener but, despite the need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.",B2,"Susan Shepherd is an artist. She paints flowers. She has a big garden. The garden has many flowers. She likes tulips and poppies best. The flowers grow in the garden.

There is a path in the garden. Flowers grow next to the path. The flowers look nice. The people who lived here before liked gardens. They left the flowers for Susan. Danny is the gardener. He helps Susan. At first, he said no to some of her ideas. But when she said she wanted to paint the flowers, he said yes.

Susan likes to paint one flower. She does not paint the whole garden. She takes a flower to her room. She paints one flower. Then she paints another flower. A picture can take a long time. Sometimes it takes two years.

Spring and summer are busy. The tulips and poppies are out. Susan is very busy. She also likes old flowers. She puts tulips in water. After one day, they change. They open and look beautiful.

Susan liked plants when she was a child. At school, she learned about plants. She picked wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers then. She thought they were not real. Now, her garden has flowers from other countries. They grow well.

Five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys.
A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to get back there as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes.It never matters what the weather is like, or what time of the year it is, it is always enchanting. Out of the other window are some of the best back gardens and residences in the whole of France. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.

I have enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if I had to pick a favourite it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in my youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park. I was regarded as being too young and troublesome and was sent off to an aunt. When I came to live in England as a teenager, I still hadn't travelled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I ever saw and its great glass dome filled me with wonder.

I am indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. It was on the train that my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was absolutely wonderful. Someone happened to mention that pink was good for the brain, and I've never stopped wearing the colour since. What I remember about the journey itself, however, is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Ll,!XOrI.t was, without a doubt, the perfect way to wind down after all the wedding preparations.

We were working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way we could continue our journey was to take what was affectionately known as the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We also heard that, in any case,the driver would often wait for days to depart if he knew there were people still on their way. When it appeared, there was a sudden charge of what seemed like hundreds of people climbing into and onto the carriages - people were even allowed to travel on the roof free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like travelling across the moon.

I imagine most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not my case. I was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains began to dominate my life. I made a film which featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, disused stretch of the line which had been lovingly maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we took every opportunity to have a ride on the train, and, when I went back last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!

143,"Miss Rita Cohen, a tiny, pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be some six years older, came to his facto1y one day. She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes, and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She was so tiny, so young that he could barely believe that she was at the University of Pennsylvania, doing research into the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
Three or four times a year someone either phoned Seymour or wrote to him to ask permission to see his factory, and occasionally he would assist a student by answering questions over the phone or, if the student struck him as especially serious, by offering a brief tour.
Rita Cohen was nearly as small, he thought, as the children from Marie's third-year class, who'd been brought the 50 kilometres from their rural schoolhouse one day, all those years ago, so that Marie's daddy could show them how he made gloves, show them especially Marie's favourite spot, the laying-off table, where, at the end of the process, the men shaped and pressed each and every glove by pulling it carefully down over steam-heated brass hands. The hands were dangerously hot and they were shiny and they stuck straight up from the table in a row, thin-looking, like hands that had been flattened. As a little girl, Marie was captivated by their strangeness and called them the 'pancake hands'.
He heard Rita asking, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'How many? Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She continued taking notes as she asked, 'They come direct to your shipping department?'
He liked finding that she was interested in eve1y last detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material and they make it into the right kind of weather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery right here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started working in the business. Ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you've got to go to a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I'll set that up for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. The technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't that different from what you'd have seen hundreds of years ago. Awful work. It's said to be the oldest industry of which remains have been found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old relics of tanning found somewhere Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins that were tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather scholar; he's the one you should be talking to. Start my father off about gloves and he'll talk for two days. That's typical, by the way: glovemen love the trade and everything about it. Tell me, have you ever seen anything being manufactured, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'Saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.'
He laughed. She had made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was easily 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where she was dark, but othenwise Rita Cohen had begun to remind him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that would just waft out of her and into the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned in class. How she remembered everything. Everything neatly taken down in her notebook and memorised overnight.
'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to bring you right through the whole process. Come on. We're going to make you a pair of gloves and you're going to watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?'",B2,,"One day, a young woman named Miss Rita Cohen came to Seymour's factory. She was very small and had pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was older. She wore work clothes and big, ugly shoes. Her pretty face was surrounded by lots of curly hair. Seymour found it hard to believe she was a university student studying the leather business.

Sometimes, students called or wrote to Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes he answered their questions on the phone. If a student seemed very interested, he sometimes gave them a short tour of the factory.

Rita was as small as the children in Marie's class from years ago. Back then, those children came 50 kilometers from their small school so Marie's dad could show them how he made gloves. He showed them his daughter's favorite place: the table where the men put each glove on hot, shiny, metal hands to shape them. The metal hands looked thin and flat. When Marie was little, she thought they were strange and called them ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked Seymour, ""How many gloves come in one delivery?""
Seymour answered, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.""
She wrote in her notebook and asked, ""Do they come straight to your factory?""
""No, they go to the tannery first. The tannery prepares the leather for us. My grandfather, my father, and I all worked in a tannery. Have you ever been inside one?""
""Not yet,"" she said.
""Well, you should see one if you are writing about leather. I can arrange that for you. Tanneries are very old-fashioned places. The work is very hard. People say it is the oldest industry in the world. I think they found six-thousand-year-old tanning tools in Turkey. The first clothes were just animal skins. My father knows a lot about leather. He can talk about gloves for two days! People who make gloves really love their work. Tell me, have you ever seen how something is made?""
""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was little,"" Rita said.

Seymour laughed. She made him laugh. She was young and honest, and she wanted to learn. His daughter, Marie, was much taller than Rita and had light hair, while Rita had dark hair. But Rita was starting to remind him of Marie—smart and happy, full of new things she learned at school. She remembered everything and wrote it all in her notebook.

""I'll tell you what we'll do,"" Seymour said. ""We will show you the whole process of making gloves. Come with me. We will make a pair of gloves just for you, and you can watch from start to finish. What size do you wear?""","One day, a young woman named Miss Rita Cohen came to Seymour’s factory. She was small and pale, and looked much younger than his daughter Marie, but she said she was actually a few years older. She wore work clothes and big, ugly shoes, and had a lot of curly hair around her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research for her Master’s degree on the leather industry in New Jersey.

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes he helped students by answering their questions on the phone. If a student seemed very serious, he sometimes gave them a short tour of the factory.

“Never?” he asked.

144,"It's true - we're all getting too big for our boots
Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'
For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.
This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.
Nevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.
As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.
The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.
However, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, members of the human race were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have got slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.
",B2,,"It's true - people are getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. His teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" The teacher said this because Chris was already very tall. He was almost two metres tall at fourteen. Now, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain.

Every ten years, people in Europe grow one more centimetre on average. Every year, more very tall people are born. But this does not mean we are becoming a super race. In fact, we are becoming more like our ancestors who lived in caves. For a long time, people did not eat well. Now, our diet is better, so we are growing taller. A scientist says, ""We are only now starting to reach our full potential. We are becoming like the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

Long ago, people found food in many ways. Women collected plants, fruits, and berries. Men sometimes hunted animals. Some groups of people still live like this today. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed things a lot. Farmers used more and more land. Now, just three plants - wheat, rice, and corn - give people more than half of their food.

This simple diet was bad for people's health and bodies. For centuries, people ate a lot of soups, porridge, and bread. This food was not good enough, so people did not grow well. In one study, scientists saw that when people started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and thin farmers. They had more problems with their teeth and more diseases. Some experts say corn was very bad for health.

But farming spread because farmland could feed many more people than hunting and gathering. The problem that people on this diet were not healthy and did not grow tall has only recently been noticed, even in rich countries. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are people now eating a rich diet like their ancestors.

Because of this, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall. In Holland, he is 180 cm, and in Japan, he is 177 cm. This is a good change, but it also causes problems. People are taller, but many things have not changed. A normal bed has been 190 cm long since 1860. There is less space for legs on planes and trains. Clothes makers often have to change their sizes.

So, what will happen? We cannot grow taller forever. There must be a limit. One expert thinks the limit could be 193 cm. We might reach it in this century.

But scientists also say something else. Single people are growing taller because they eat better. But as a group, humans are actually getting a little smaller. During the last ice age 10,000 years ago, people were a bit taller and rounder. This helped them stay warm in the cold. Since the world became warmer, we have become a little thinner and smaller, even with good food. As the world gets hotter, we may get even smaller. So, people are growing taller, but global warming might make us smaller.","It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. 'What do you want to be?' the teacher asked. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher said this because Chris, at only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.

Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe grows by one centimetre. Every year, more very tall people are born. This is interesting, but it doesn't mean humans are becoming a super race. In fact, we are returning to how we were long ago. We are only now losing the effects of many years of bad food. 'We are only now starting to reach our full potential,' says scientist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming like the people who lived 40,000 years ago.'

For most of human history, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women collected plants, fruits, and berries, while men sometimes hunted animals. Some groups of people still live like this today. One study found they ate 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, farming began. This had big consequences. Farmers slowly took over most green areas. Now, just three main plants - wheat, rice, and corn - give us more than half of our food.

This simple diet was bad for human health and growth. For centuries, people ate mostly soups, porridge, and bread. This left them hungry and not growing well. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when people started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and thin farmers. They had more tooth problems and diseases. Some experts say corn was actually bad for public health.

But farming spread because farmland could feed ten times more people than hunting and gathering. The fact that people eating this way were often unhealthy and small has only recently been addressed, even in rich countries. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are people starting to eat as well as our ancestors did.

Because of this, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good change, but it brings problems too. People are taller, but many things haven't changed. A normal bed has been 190 cm long since 1860. There is less leg room on planes and trains now. Clothes makers often have to change their sizes.

The question is: when will we stop growing taller? We can't grow forever. There must be a limit. According to expert Robert Fogel, it could be 193 cm, and we might reach that limit this century.

However, scientists add one important point. Individual people are growing taller because of better food, but as a species, humans are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age 10,000 years ago, humans were a bit rounder and taller - this helped them stay warm. Since the climate got warmer, we have become a little thinner and smaller, even with good food. As the world continues to get warmer, we may become even smaller. This means global warming could stop humans from getting taller.",,,
145,"It's true - we're all getting too big for our boots

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'
For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.
This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.
Nevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.
As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.
The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.
However, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, members of the human race were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have got slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.
",B2,,"It's true - we are all getting taller.

Chris Greener was fourteen. He told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What job do you want? The flagpole on a ship?"" The teacher said this because Chris was very tall. Now, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.

Every ten years, people in Europe grow one more centimetre. Every year, more tall people are born. This is interesting, but it does not mean a new super race is coming. We are becoming more like people from long ago. For many years, people did not eat good food. Now we are changing because we eat better. A scientist says, ""We are now starting to be what we should be. We are becoming like people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of history, people found food in many ways. Women got plants and fruits. Men hunted animals. Some people still live like this today. They eat many wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed many things. Farmers used most of the land. Now, just three plants - wheat, rice, and corn - give people more than half of their food.

This food was not good for people's health. For many years, people ate a lot of soup and bread. This food was not good enough. People were often sick and small. In one study, people started to grow corn. Healthy people became sick and thin. They had more bad teeth and more sickness. Some experts say corn was bad for health.

But farming spread because farms could feed more people. The problem was that people on farms were not healthy. Only rich countries have fixed this recently. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan do people now eat good food like long ago.

Because of this, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall. In Holland, he is 180 cm, and in Japan, 177 cm. This is good, but it makes problems. People are taller, but the world is the same. Beds have been the same length for a long time. There is less leg space on planes and trains. Clothes companies must change their sizes.

The question is: when will we stop growing? We cannot grow forever. There must be a tallest height. One expert thinks it could be 193 cm. We might be that tall in this century.

But scientists say another thing. Single people grow taller with good food. But all people together are getting a little smaller. Long ago, during the ice age, people were bigger and rounder. This helped them stay warm. Now the world is warmer, so people are thinner and smaller. As the world gets hotter, we may get even smaller. So, global warming might stop people from getting taller.","It's true - we are all getting taller.

146,"My line of work

Four people talk about their jobs.
Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum
I'm responsible for putting temporary exhibitions together. This includes planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. I have to read up about the subject of the exhibition beforehand and then talk to important people in the area so that I can establish the main themes and aims of the exhibition, and plan what objects and pictures should be displayed. I have to make sure the public can understand the thinking behind the exhibition, which means planning interactive displays, workshops and theatre. I also have to bring in engineers and electricians to make sure the final display is not dangerous to visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write the brochures and leaflets that we'll use to tell people about it.

Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers
The first thing I do when I get here at 7.30 a.m. is check the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents need to be produced in order to learn the 'runs' or routes necessary to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, working out how to make the journeys. They work out the most direct route, using the correct one-way streets, and right- and left- hand turns. I get involved when there's a difference of opinion - like whether you can do a right turn at a particular junction. When they're close to the test, I'll give them a simple route and no matter what way they say they'll go, I'll tell them they have to use another route because the road is closed. The next student will have to find a third route and again I'll come up with a reason why they can't go that way. It's just to make them think.

Sarah - Marine Conservationist
I live by the coast and work from home. This involves responding to telephone enquiries, producing educational resources and setting up training courses. Occasionally, I go into our main office but generally I am on the coast. I also work with schools and study centres and run courses for coastal managers and those involved in making decisions about the fate of the seas.I do things like take them out to sea in a boat in an attempt to make them think more about the life underneath them. This often changes their views as it's very different from making decisions using a computer screen. I am extremely lucky because conservation is my hobby, so the job has many highs for me. The downside of the job is that I work for a charity, so there is a constant need for more money. This means I'm always looking for more resources and I'm not able to achieve everything I want.

Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
My work is pretty varied. I have to make sure that the publishing programme matches market requirements, and ensure that we keep stocks of 300 or so of the books that we publish. We have very high standards of information and content. We receive many letters from readers on issues such as the representation of international boundaries and these in particular require a careful response. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work as part of an enthusiastic group which makes the job that much more enjoyable. The negative side, as with many jobs, is that there is far too much administration to deal with, which leaves less time to work on the more interesting tasks such as product development and design.

147,"Gary and Me

The restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef.
I believe everyone's given a chance in life. My son, Gary, was given his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I rushed over to look at the place. It was in a really bad state. It was perfect for what I had in mind.
Coming into this business made me recall my childhood. I can remember my mother going out to work in a factory and me being so upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We want time for family life.' My wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived over the restaurant in those days, and we always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. It's paid dividends with our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. Also, from a very early age they would come down and talk to our regular customers. It's given both of them a great start in life.
Gary was quite a lively child when he was really small. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven he thought he'd jump into it like a swimming pool, and he knocked himself out. When he was older he had to work for pocket money. He started off doing odd jobs and by the age of about ten he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had loads of money at school. He had discipline. He used to be up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out.
Gary wasn't very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. By the age of 15 he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair. So when he came to me and said, 'Dad, I've got to do work experience as part of my course at school,' I sent him to a friend of mine who's got a restaurant.
Gary recently took up playing the drums and now he has his own band. Goodness knows what will happen to the cooking if the music takes off. My advice to Gary would be: if you start chasing two hares, you end up catching neither, so chase the hare you know you're going to catch. He understood when I said to him: 'Gary, if you're going to get anywhere in life, you've got to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.'
Gary went to catering college at the age of 17, and on his first day he and the other new students -they're normally complete beginners - were given what's supposed to be a morning's work. But within an hour Gary had chopped all his vegetables, sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son for you! In the end, he was helping other people out.
None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you've got to work jolly hard for it, because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he's been given and grabbed hold of it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten per cent of what you've told them, you've got to be happy with that. The things Gary says, the things he does, I think, well, he must have listened sometimes.",B2,,"Gary and Me

John Moore has a restaurant. He writes about his son Gary. Gary is a famous chef on TV.
I think everyone gets a chance in life. My son Gary's chance was cooking. My chance was to have a restaurant. When I saw the restaurant, it was very old and dirty. But it was perfect for me.
This made me think about when I was a child. I remember my mother went to work in a factory. I was sad because I was alone. So I thought, 'Family time is important.' My wife stayed home with our children and did the money work. I ran the restaurant. We lived above the restaurant. We always ate meals together. This was good for our children, Gary and Joe. They are both very sure of themselves. When they were young, they came to the restaurant and talked to our customers. This helped them a lot in life.
Gary was a very active little boy. We had a big bath. When he was seven, he jumped into it like it was a swimming pool. He hit his head and fell asleep for a minute. When he was older, he worked for pocket money. First, he did small jobs. By age ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend. So he always had a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined. He woke up earlier than me. In a family business, everyone helps. It was nice to see him help.
Gary didn't like school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the other cooks. Sometimes he was the boss. He made over a hundred meals. Then I knew he would work with food. He had a special talent. One day he said, 'Dad, I need to do work for my school course.' I sent him to my friend's restaurant.
Recently, Gary started to play the drums. Now he has a band. I don't know what will happen to his cooking if the music is successful. My advice to Gary is: if you try to catch two rabbits, you catch none. So catch the one you know you can get. He understood when I told him: 'Gary, if you want to do well in life, you must do it before you are 30. If you don't, it is too late.'
Gary went to cooking school when he was 17. On the first day, the teacher gave the new students a job for the whole morning. But Gary finished everything in one hour. He cut all the vegetables and meat. He prepared all the food. That's my son! Then he helped the other students.
We are all surprised that Gary's TV cooking show is so popular. I am very proud of him. I always told him: if you want something, you must work very hard for it. Nobody gives you anything for free. Gary saw his chance and took it. You talk to your children when they grow up. If they listen to only ten percent of what you say, you should be happy. When I see what Gary says and does, I think he listened to me sometimes.","Gary and Me

She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teach- ing, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots.'They are used to these conditions, which mean they can't stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. Adive can last for 16hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button.' The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. 'No one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.'
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but Ido it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"".' This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. 
The relief was incredible - we were still alive!'
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had 
studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was such an amazing feeling.'",B2,,"IN HOT WATER

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She loves to go to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

Rachel teaches and studies the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small, strong car for underwater travel. She goes down three kilometres into the ocean to look at underwater volcanoes.

""Inside, it is very small,"" she says. ""I can touch the two pilots."" The pilots are used to the small space. They cannot stand up or move. They must stay inside until someone opens the door. A trip can take 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to get rocks and water, and three hours to go up.

""If there is a problem and you need to go up fast, you can press a button,"" she says. Then, a small part of the vehicle lets go and goes quickly to the top. ""No one has tried it yet. I think the trip would not be nice.""

""The first time I got into the vehicle, I was on a ship with a teacher. He told me what to do if something bad happens. They wanted to see how I felt in the small space.""

Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she went with a Russian team. ""We sailed for five days west of the Canary Islands. On the ocean floor, there is a big area of underwater volcanoes. Black smoke comes out of them. The Russian team left some science things there. They wanted to learn about the volcanoes.""

When she is not at sea, Rachel works in her office. ""I love teaching, and it helps me pay for my work on the 'black smokers'."" Black smokers is another name for the underwater volcanoes. Very hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke.

""The only time I was scared was with the Americans. We were pulling equipment on a long rope. Suddenly, there was a loud noise. The noise hit our vehicle. I thought, 'I am going to die.' We looked at each other and waited. When nothing happened, we were very happy to be alive!""

""It is a great adventure to go to the deep ocean. Every time I look out the window and see the volcanoes, I feel happy and surprised. I am at the bottom of the sea, and I am seeing things no one has seen before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my work. When I saw them for real, it was a great feeling.""","IN HOT WATER

Supermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar- coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff and, anyway, if I agree to their demands I feel I've been persuaded against my better judgement and I feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Yet I hate myself for saying no all the time, and I get cross and defensive in anticipation as we leave home. I do my best to avoid taking them shopping but then I worry that I'm not allowing them to have the experience they need in order to make their own choices. I can't win.'
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. More than PS150 million a year is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. That figure is likely to increase and it is in the supermarket aisles that the investment is most likely to be successful. For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up the difference.",B2,"Shopping with kids is hard. One mother says, ""My kids want everything. They see sweet cereal, a Disney movie, or a comic. I can't buy all these things. If I say yes, I feel bad. If I say no, I feel bad too. I get angry before we go to the store. I try not to take them, but then I worry. I want them to learn to choose things. It is not easy.""

A study says kids ask for something every two minutes in a store. Companies spend a lot of money on TV ads for kids. The ads make kids want things. Kids don't know why parents say no. The ads look fun.

Susan Dibb works with food. She says, ""Parents want to give kids good food. But kids see fun ads on TV. Parents have to say no many times. This is hard for parents."" TV rules say ads can't tell kids to ask parents to buy things. But the ads still make kids want things.

Parents get tired of saying yes or no. One mother talks to her kids about food. She says, ""We read food labels. My son thinks ads are not true. Now my kids don't ask for many things at the store. This is good.""

Parents are not always the same. Mike is a dad. He says, ""We say no to candy for our son. But we buy cream and chocolate for us. It is fun to buy nice things. Kids want nice things too. Sometimes I say yes. Sometimes I say no. It is hard to always say the same thing.""

Stores can help. They can take candy away from the checkout. They can make a play area for kids. Then parents can shop alone. Parents may buy less, but they will be happy. More parents may come to the store.",,"Shopping with children can be very difficult. One mother says, ""My children always want to buy things they see. If it's not sugary cereal, it's a Disney film or a comic. Often, they want all three. I don't have enough money for all these things. Also, if I say yes, I feel bad because I know these things are not good for them. But I also feel bad when I always say no. I get angry before we even leave the house. I try not to take them shopping, but then I worry they won't learn how to choose things for themselves. It feels like I can never do the right thing.""

Studies show that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. Companies spend over £150 million every year on advertising to children, mostly on TV. This amount will probably grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising works best. Children often don't understand why their parents say no to things. Parents say sugar is bad for their teeth, but this is not as powerful as the fun and exciting advertisements they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents want to give their children healthy food, even if they don't always know what is truly healthy. It's good when parents talk to their children about food. If children only learn from TV ads, they get only one side of the story. Parents don't like that they have to compete with advertisements. They don't like having to say no to their children all the time."" There are rules that stop ads from telling children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Susan Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if the ad doesn't say 'Ask your mum to buy this,' that is still what they want to happen.""

For many parents, the hardest part is deciding when to say yes and when to say no. One mother says she talks a lot with her children about food. ""My son sees the ads, but he doesn't always believe them. We talk about different products and read the labels on food. I have talked about it so much that now he thinks all ads are silly. Now we don't have many problems in the supermarket because my children don't ask for things I won't buy.""

Parents also say they are not always consistent. Mike, a father of two, says, ""We tell our son he can't have sweets because they are bad for him. But at the same time, we are buying cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's fun to buy nice things, and it's normal that children want to do that too. But their requests still annoy me sometimes. It depends on my mood. If I'm happy and feeling kind, I am more likely to say yes. It's difficult to always make the same decision.""

Supermarkets could help reduce these problems. They could stop putting sweets near the checkout. They could even create play areas where children can stay while parents shop. Parents might buy a little less if their children aren't with them, but many more parents would probably come to the supermarket if they could shop peacefully. This would likely make up for any lost money.",,,

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners.
This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m: to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says.
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.'
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now.
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m. Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.",B2,"Sarah is a chalet girl. She works in France.

At 11 in the morning, Sarah goes skiing. She skis a lot. She comes back to the chalet to make dinner. She does not sleep before dinner. Dinner has three parts. It is ready at 8 in the evening. After dinner, Sarah cleans the kitchen. Sometimes she talks with the guests. Sometimes the guests like to be alone.

Sarah meets her friends at night. They go to different places. But on Saturday, Sarah does not stay out late. Sunday is a very busy day.

On Sunday, Sarah starts work early. She makes breakfast at 7 in the morning. After the guests leave, she cleans everything. Then new guests come. Sarah makes tea for them. The new guests sometimes have many questions.

""Good guests can make a week fantastic - breakfast this morning was really fun - but some weeks, for various reasons, aren't as good,"" she observes.

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually begin at Bananas, then we might go to G Jay's and perhaps finish at Dick's T-Bar,"" she says. But Sarah never stays out very late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a horrible day,"" she says, ""and you definitely don't want to cook breakfast when you're exhausted.""

On Sunday, work starts earlier than usual because guest breakfast must be ready by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests leave, Sarah cleans everything very thoroughly. ""We clean the entire place - we clear the breakfast things, remove the bed sheets, and prepare everything,"" she explains. If she didn't do the weekly shopping on Saturday, she does it now.

Around 3 p.m., when the cleaning is finished, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. ""They arrive at about 4.30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and ask lots of questions. I believe the mountain air affects them,"" she notes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop. Then a staff member from the shop drives her back to the chalet. Soon it's time to prepare dinner again and possibly chat with friends, though not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she concludes.",,,

'After 14 years in business, I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. But I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years when I was made redundant. It came out of the blue. I didn't get a particularly good pay-off but it was enough to set up the farm with. My break came when I got to know the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. Through supplying them, my reputation spread and now I also supply meat through mail order. I'm glad

154,"There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas to discover that your baggage has been left behind. At best you will have to put up with wearing the clothes you stand up in for hours or days, until the airline reunites you with your luggage. At worst, you may be in a different climate zone, thousands of miles from home and forced to wear wholly unsuitable clothes.
Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. Even the best airlines slip up from time to time, and it is impossible for any carrier to guarantee that a passenger's checked luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when a journey calls for one or more changes of aircraft. 
The system works like this. Airlines insist on exaggerated check-in times (which require passengers to report to the airport at a given time before departure) designed to allow sufficient time for baggage to pass through the airport and be loaded on to the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time it takes to transfer between two flights. These, too, are exaggerated to allow for baggage transfers. 
In normal circumstances the system works well. But extra security checks at airports and problems with air traffic combine to cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. Then there is the possibility of human error, or an accident in which the destination label is torn off. 
These problems can become severe at large transfer airports, known as 'hubs', because of the large number of bags that are processed. Last year, for example, London's Heathrow airport handled more than 41 million passengers, of whom nine million were changing planes. British Airways alone handled two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with most making the one-mile transfer between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European 
flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). 
Even efficient transfer airports, such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore and Zurich have their bad days. The risk of baggage being lost when changing planes is higher than average at certain airports. Even the United States has problems - Miami airport is well known for luggage going missing when transatlantic passengers make immediate connections for destinations in Latin America. 
You should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If a change of plane is unavoidable, or makes your flight less expensive, then try to fly the same airline throughout. Try to allow more connecting time by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure you label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. 
If, after all this, your luggage still goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport. 
",B2,,"It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find that your bags are not there. Sometimes, you have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until you get your bags back. Other times, you may be in a place with very different weather, far from home, and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather.

All airlines sometimes lose bags. Even the best airlines make mistakes. If you travel often, you may lose your bags one day. No airline can promise that your bags will always be on the same plane as you, especially if you change planes.

Airlines ask you to check in early. This gives them time to move your bags to the plane. They also plan enough time for you and your bags to change planes.

Usually, this system works. But sometimes, flights are late because of security checks or air traffic problems. This can make the baggage system fail. Sometimes, people make mistakes, or the tag on your bag comes off.

Big airports where many people change planes have more problems. For example, last year, many people changed planes at London's Heathrow airport. Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich sometimes lose bags. In the United States, Miami airport often loses bags when people fly from Europe and then go to Latin America.

Here is some advice:
- Try to take a flight with no changes.
- Check in early.
- If you must change planes, try to use the same airline.
- Give yourself more time between flights.
- Write your name and address on your bags, inside and outside. Also write your flight numbers.

If you lose your bags, you must talk to an airline worker in the baggage area before you leave the airport. You will need to fill out a form about your lost bags.","It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find that your bags did not arrive.

Other times, you might be in a place with very different weather, far from home, and have to wear clothes that are not right for the climate.

Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it is common for people who travel a lot to lose their luggage at some point. Even the best airlines sometimes make mistakes. No airline can promise that your checked bag will always be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Here is how the system works: Airlines ask you to check in early. This gives them enough time to move your bag through the airport and put it on the plane. They also plan enough time between connecting flights so bags can be moved to the next plane.

Usually, the system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks or air traffic problems cause flights to be late. This can make the baggage system fail. People can also make mistakes, or a luggage tag can fall off.

These problems can be worse at big airports where many people change planes. For example, last year, London's Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers. Nine million of them were changing flights. British Airways had two million people changing planes at Heathrow, often moving between two different terminals.

Even good airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich sometimes have problems. The chance of losing your bag is higher at some airports when you change planes. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when people fly across the Atlantic and then take another flight to Latin America.

To avoid problems, try to take a direct flight if you can. Check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline for the whole trip. Give yourself more time between flights by taking an earlier one to the transfer airport. Put labels on the inside and outside of your bag with your home address and your holiday address. Remember to write your flight numbers on the labels.

If you still lose your bag, you must find the airline’s baggage office in the airport. Fill out a lost luggage form before you leave the airport.",,,

We are not concerned with those looking for a second temporary position while hunting for a permanent job. Nor are we concerned with those leaving an unsatisfactory job within the first few weeks. Instead, we will be dealing with those of you taking a real step on the career ladder, choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions now that you have learnt your way around, acquired some skills and have some idea of where you want to go. 
What sort of job should you look for? Much depends on your long-term aim. You need to ask yourself whether you want to specialise in a particular field, work your way up to higher levels of responsibility or out of your current employment into a broader field. 
Whatever you decide, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. 
This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious [line 26: beginning] career planning. Most important, it should [line 26: end] extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility. Incidentally, if the travel bug is biting, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see [line 34: beginning] that you have got it out of your system, and [line 34: end] are not likely to go off again. 
Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors. It was the perfect first job in that 'OK ... they were very supportive people. I was gently introduced to the work, learnt my way round an office and improved my word processing skills. However, there was no scope for advancement. One day I gave in my notice, bought an air ticket and travelled for a year.' 
Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years I have become more able and my job has really grown,' she says. 'Right from the beginning my boss was very keen to develop me. My job title is the same as it was when I started but the duties have changed. From mainly typing and telephone work, I have progressed to doing most of the correspondence and budgets. I also have to deal with a variety of queries, coming from chairmen of large companies to people wanting to know how to start their own business. Brenda involves me in all her work but also gives me specific projects to do and events to organise.'

What job should you look for? It depends on what you want in the future. Ask yourself: Do you want to work in one special area? Do you want more important work? Or do you want to try a different kind of job?

No matter what you choose, you must think a lot about your second job. You should plan to stay in this job for two or three years.

When you ask for your next job, people will look at this second job. It should show you have a plan for your work life. Most of all, it should help you learn, get better, and give you more to do.

If you want to travel, now is a good time. You can do short jobs when you come back, and then find your second job. Future bosses will be happy to see you have travelled already and will not leave to travel again.

But she could not get a better job there. So one day, she left, bought a plane ticket, and travelled for a year.

Now, Juliette works for Brenda Cleverdon. Brenda is the boss of a company. ""In two and a half years, I can do more and my job has changed,"" she says. ""My boss always helped me learn. My job name is the same, but my work is different. First, I typed and talked on the phone. Now I write letters, work with money, and answer many questions. People ask me how to start a business. Brenda lets me help with her work and gives me my own jobs to do.""","There is a lot of advice for students who are leaving college and starting their first job. In this article, we talk about moving to a second job. We are not talking about people who take a second short job while they look for a permanent one. We are also not talking about people who leave a bad job after only a few weeks. Instead, we are talking about people who are moving up in their career. You have learned some skills, you know how things work, and you have an idea about your future.

What kind of job should you look for? This depends a lot on your long-term goals. You need to ask yourself: Do you want to become an expert in one area? Do you want to get more responsibility? Or do you want to move into a different kind of work?

Whatever you choose, you should think carefully about your second job. You should plan to stay in this job for two or three years.

When you apply for your next job, people will look closely at this second job. It should show that you are planning your career carefully. Most importantly, it should help you learn new things, grow your skills, and give you more responsibility.

By the way, if you really want to travel, now is a good time to go. You can travel for a while, then come back and do some temporary work. After that, you can find your second job. Future employers will be happy to see that you have already travelled, so they will know you probably won’t want to leave again soon.

156,"Bitter water hits the big time

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is now part of a multi-million pound worldwide business. 

At Easter, British people spend over PS230 million on chocolate. A massive eight per cent of all chocolate is bought at this time. 
Only at Christmas do people eat more of the cocoa-based foodstuffs. Although the large-scale industrial production of chocolate began in the last century, the cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec and Mayan civilisations of Central America over three thousand years ago. 
The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant which is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is melon-sized and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried they become cacao beans, which can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans. 
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also used them to make a drink called xocoatl. This is from the word in the Aztec language, Nahuatl, meaning 'bitter water'. In Aztec times the chocolate drink was flavoured with spices and used on ceremonial occasions and for welcoming visitors. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe did not spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. 
Until the last century, the chocolate drink was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten of the Netherlands invented chocolate powder. This was made by extracting most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. 
The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to produce a solid block that you could eat. A Swiss company then introduced milk solids to the process which gave us milk chocolate. 
At the turn of the century, the British chocolate market was dominated by French companies. In 1879 the English company Cadbury even named their Birmingham factory Bournville (ville is the French word for town) in the hope that a little French glamour would rub off. But then came Cadbury's famous Dairy Milk bar which began life as Dairymaid in 1905. Clever advertising which associated it with the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside quickly established the bar as a rival to the more decadent French brands. 
It seems that, for the time being at least, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week. This has forced manufacturers to look for new ways to attract customers.
The latest marketing trick is the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert, to tempt chocoholics who have grown tired of conventional snacks. 
At the other end of the production process, cacao farmers are still feeling the effects of a crash in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. As most cacao farmers operate on a very small scale, many were forced out of business. Perhaps you could spare a thought for them as you munch your next chocolate bars. ",B2,,"Chocolate is very popular all over the world. It started in South America.

At Easter, people in Britain buy a lot of chocolate. They spend millions of pounds. People buy more chocolate at Easter than at any other time, except for Christmas.

People first grew the cacao plant a very long time ago. The cacao tree grows in hot countries. Its fruit has seeds inside. These seeds are called cacao beans. We use them to make chocolate.

A long time ago, the Aztec people used the beans as money. They also made a drink from them. The Spanish people later added sugar to this drink. Many years after, chocolate houses opened in European cities.

In the 1800s, a man made chocolate powder. Then, a company in England made the first chocolate bar you could eat. Later, a Swiss company made the first milk chocolate.

At first, French chocolate companies were very popular in Britain. Then, an English company called Cadbury made a famous chocolate bar. Their advertising said it was healthy because it had milk. It became very popular.

Today, people in Britain eat a lot of chocolate. Chocolate companies are making new things, like chocolate ice cream, to sell more.

But life is hard for the farmers who grow the cacao beans. The price of the beans went down, so many farmers lost their jobs. Next time you eat chocolate, think about these farmers.","Chocolate is now a very popular product all over the world, and it is a huge business worth millions of pounds.

In Britain, people buy a lot of chocolate at Easter, spending over £230 million. In fact, eight per cent of all chocolate for the year is sold at this time. Only Christmas is a bigger time for eating chocolate.

Chocolate comes from the cacao tree. This tree grows in hot, tropical places like Africa, South America, and Asia. The tree has a large fruit, and inside are 20 to 40 seeds. When these seeds are dried, they become cacao beans. We use these beans to make chocolate. In English, people sometimes call them 'cocoa beans', but this name came from a spelling mistake a long time ago.

A long time ago, the Aztec people in Central America used the beans as money. They also made a drink from them called 'xocoatl', which means 'bitter water'. They added spices to the drink and had it on special days or when guests visited. Later, Spanish people tried the drink and made it sweeter by adding sugar and cinnamon. About one hundred years later, the drink became popular in Europe. In the late 1600s, 'chocolate houses' opened in big European cities where people could go to drink chocolate.

For a long time, people made the chocolate drink by breaking a solid block of chocolate into hot water. Then, in 1826, a man from the Netherlands named CJ van Houten invented chocolate powder. He did this by taking out most of the fat from the crushed beans.

The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847. A company in Bristol, called Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa fat, chocolate, and sugar to make a solid bar you could eat. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate.

At first, French companies sold the most chocolate in Britain. An English company, Cadbury, even gave their factory in Birmingham a French-sounding name, Bournville, hoping it would seem more fashionable. But then, in 1905, Cadbury created their famous Dairy Milk bar. Clever advertisements said it was a healthy chocolate because it had lots of milk from the English countryside. This made it very popular, and it became a strong competitor to the French brands.

Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Because people are not buying much more chocolate than before, companies are trying new ideas to sell their products. One new idea is the 'extended line'. This is when a normal chocolate bar is also sold as an ice cream, a drink, or a dessert. The companies hope this will attract people who want to try something different.

However, life is difficult for the farmers who grow the cacao beans. At the end of the 1980s, the price for the beans fell a lot. Many farmers work on small farms, and a lot of them had to stop growing cacao because they could not make enough money. So, next time you eat a chocolate bar, maybe think about the farmers who grow the beans.",,,

On the very last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting to catch the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot more people waiting than I had expected. That airy, light, clean, polished feeling I generally got in the station had been lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage stuffed the benches, and swarms of college kids littered the floor with their bags.
A grey-haired man was walking around speaking to different strangers one by one. Well-off, you could tell: tanned skin, nice sweater, soft, beige car-coat. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I had been thinking I wouldn't mind talking to her myself. The man said, 'Would you by any chance be travelling to Philadelphia?'
'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?'
'No, New York, but I'll be ...'
'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and he moved toward the next bench.
Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to
Philadelphia?' When the woman told him, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say a thing, just marched on down the row to one of the matched-luggage couples. I straightened up from my pillar and drifted closer, looking toward the platform as if I had my mind on the train.
Well, I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't, of course.
No doubt, I struck him as unreliable. He just glanced quickly at me and then swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. By now he was looking seriously stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!'
She lowered her book. She was thirtyish, maybe thirty-five - older than I was, anyhow. A school- teacher sort. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Why, yes, I am.'
'Then could I ask you a favour?'
I stopped several feet away and frowned down at my left wrist. (Never mind that I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could sense how she went on guard. The man must have sensed it too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!'
They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples hauling their wheeled bags behind them like big pets on leashes. Next I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. So I put her on a train this morning, stopping for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife in a state. She hardly said ""hello"" to me. You see my daughter'd forgotten her passport. She'd telephoned home from the station in Philadelphia; didn't know what to do next.'
The woman clucked sympathetically. I'd have kept quiet myself. Waited to find out where he was heading with this.
'So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get somebody here to carry up her passport.'
A likely story! Why didn't he go himself, if this was such an emergency?
'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked him.
'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.'
This seemed like a pretty poor excuse, if you want my honest opinion. Also, it exceeded the amount of bad luck that one family could expect. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been the logical choice, but one of those padded envelopes the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked to be stapled shut besides. Watch yourself, lady, I said silently.",B2,,"On the last day of a bad year, I was standing in the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were many more people than I thought. The station usually felt big and clean, but not today. Old couples with the same bags sat on the seats. Many college students sat on the floor with their bags.

A man with grey hair was walking around. He was talking to different people. He looked rich. He had a nice sweater and a light coat. He went to a woman sitting alone and asked her something. Then he came to a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I thought she looked nice. The man asked her, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?""

""Well, my train is going north, yes,"" she said. ""But to Philadelphia? No, to New York.""

""Thank you,"" he said, and he walked to the next seat.

Now I was watching him. ""Ma'am,"" he asked an old woman, ""are you going to Philadelphia?"" The woman said, ""Wilmington."" He said nothing and walked to a couple with the same bags. I moved closer to him. I looked at the train platform like I was thinking about my train.

I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I know why he didn't. I think he thought I was not a good person. He looked at me quickly and then walked away. Now he looked very worried. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you are going to Philadelphia!""

She put her book down. She was about thirty or thirty-five years old. She looked like a teacher. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am.""

""Can you do something for me?""

I stopped a few steps away and looked at my wrist. I don't have a watch. I could feel the woman become careful. The man felt it too. He said, ""It's not a difficult thing, I promise!""

They called my train now. People started walking to Gate E. The old couples pulled their bags behind them. Then I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying to another country today from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning. Then I went to buy food. When I came home, my wife was very upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the Philadelphia station. She didn't know what to do.""

The woman made a sound to show she felt sorry. I would have stayed quiet. I wanted to hear what he would say next.

""I told her to stay in the station. I said I would find someone to bring her the passport.""

I thought, that's a strange story! Why doesn't he go himself?

""Why don't you go yourself?"" the woman asked him.

""I can't leave my wife alone for so long. She uses a wheelchair.""

I thought this was a bad reason. Also, it was too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man had a small package. It was not a normal envelope. It was a soft envelope, like for a small book. Aha! It was soft so you couldn't feel what was inside! And from where I stood, it looked closed with staples. Be careful, lady, I thought.","On the last day of a bad year, I was standing by a pillar in the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia.

I moved away from my pillar and went a little closer. I looked toward the train platform as if I was thinking about the train.

They were now calling my train. People started walking toward Gate E. The older couples pulled their bags behind them like pets on a lead. Then I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying to another country this afternoon for a year of study. Her flight is from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning. Then I stopped to buy food and went home.

158,"Where I get my energy

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the full to tell us how they do it. 

A. Jeanette Kupfermann

Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning, I get tremendous energy. Anything to do with rhythm gives me energy, too - at the moment I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive and energising. I think you can feel drained if you're bored, maybe feeling life is pointless. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' 

B. Linda Kelsey

Magazine editor: 'I have so much work to do but I enjoy it all - I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even though you may be feeling tired. I need a fair bit of sleep so when I do get it I feel really good. When I'm 
running at six hours' sleep a night, I feel a bit wet. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's finding the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and I try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've done exercise, my spirits rise amazingly. I get very low patches in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's probably good to eat something then.' 

C. Annie Nightingale

Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives, grab the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You've got to achieve things and set yourself various goals. I enjoy what I do and the last two years have been very exciting. In my line of business there are lots of lively young people and you can't help being affected by that. I love tearing around the place on jobs, having a mad life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photographs but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them processed and can't wait to get them back. 
I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and it's a good release for my mind when I'm doing a lot of travelling.' 

D. Floella Benjamin

Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family and I think that being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids, they give out so much and have an inbuilt resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered off by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill you get when they smile back. It's far better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' 

E. Deborah Moggach

Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything in the world is making a garden out of complete wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I smashed up all the concrete and dug in loads of soil. It was far better than any amount of workouts or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing that somebody wants to read what I'm writing - I find it difficult to write in a void. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm found, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private property,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' 

F. Katherine Monblot

Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be a member of various committees and resented the demands they made on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so direct it into the things that are most important to you.' 

",B2,,"Where I get my energy

Emma Marsden asked six busy women to tell us how they find energy.

A. Jeanette Kupfermann

Writer: 'I think it is excitement. I need to do things that are difficult. When I learn something new, I feel very strong. Music and dance also give me energy. Now I am learning flamenco dancing. Dance is great and makes me feel happy. If you are bored, you can feel tired. Doing things well, even small things, gives you energy.'

B. Linda Kelsey

Magazine editor: 'I have a lot of work, but I like it. Work is not boring for me. If you like something, you do not feel sad, even when you are tired. I need a lot of sleep. When I sleep well, I feel very good. When I sleep only six hours, I feel a little weak. Exercise gives me energy, but sometimes I am too tired to do it. I go to a yoga class once a week. I also exercise at home. After exercise, I feel much happier. In the afternoon, between 3 and 5, I often feel tired at work. I think eating something then is a good idea.'

C. Annie Nightingale

Radio presenter: 'I do not eat special food for energy. I think it is about being happy and positive. I do not like people who are always negative. I think we should all enjoy life and do fun things now. Enjoyment is very important. You need to do things and have goals. I love my job. The last two years were very exciting. I work with many young people, and they make me feel happy too. I like going to different places for work and having a busy life. I like being with people. I enjoy taking photos, but I am not sure if they are good. I like to see my photos quickly. I also write words for songs for fun. It helps me relax when I travel a lot.'

D. Floella Benjamin

Writer and TV presenter for children: 'My energy comes from the things I do and enjoy. I think my work and my family are important. Being positive helps a lot. I love working with children because they are strong and happy. Energy comes from talking to other people. Try smiling at someone. When they smile back, it feels great. It is better than feeling sad. I try to eat good food, and I do not smoke or drink. I do not have special exercises. I run and play with children, and that keeps me active.'

E. Deborah Moggach

Writer: 'My favourite thing is to make a garden from empty land. I did this one time. The garden had only concrete. I broke the concrete and put soil in. It was better than exercise or tennis. Another thing that gives me energy is knowing people want to read my writing. It is hard to write if no one will read it. I also like walking on a farmer's land or in a wood. If someone sees me, I say, ""What a nice wood! I did not know it was private."" I like doing this because it feels like being a child.'

F. Katherine Monblot

Therapist: 'I think you need to like and respect what you do in life. I like to try new things, and I get bored easily. This helps me stay active. Doing things you do not like makes you tired. I was in some groups before, but I did not like how much time they took. You have only some energy, so use it for the things that are important to you.'","**Where I get my energy**

159,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE 

When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground, flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. The careful planning and hard work of one man, supported unfailingly by his wife, turned this piece of ground into the masterpiece you see today. 
Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved during the construction of the village to change a flat site into the sculptured landscape you see today. Although bulldozers and digging machines helped to transform the land, it also involved an enormous amount of hard labour. Once shaped, approximately 1,000 tonnes of top soil were brought in and laid over it to create the lawns, flower-beds and rockeries. 
In the creation of the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These had to be carefully selected for the area. Only those plants which were able to tolerate the salt-laden atmosphere so close to the sea could be used. They also had to stand up to the severe winter gales in this very exposed position. Most of the plants were provided by local garden centres but some came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand. 
The whole village was conceived by Colin Sims and the models, over 100, were individually made by him over a period of nine years from when the village was first opened, in 1972. The models are constructed from a variety of materials - stone, concrete, specially treated wood and plastics - to withstand all kinds of weather. Initially, Colin had to seek considerable assistance from experts who explained to him how various materials would stand up to years of changing weather. But very soon he became an expert himself.
You will soon notice that a constant scale has been strictly adhered to and that attention has been paid to even the smallest detail on the models. This has been achieved by patience and the development of unique construction techniques. The Model Village has proved to be a very popular attraction and is noted for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used to construct such true-to-life models have since been used in other model villages around England and have even been included in some courses at colleges where modelling can be studied. 
All model buildings you will see in the village portray traditional British architectural forms and are not based strictly on one particular place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. This is a typical 13th century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls. It is based on the style of manor houses commonly found in the West Country. As you walk round the village you will also notice the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo and mini golf course, the latter being the most recent addition to the village.
We ask you to keep to the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; a slip on your part can result in hours of repair work for us. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. To further your enjoyment of the Model Village, you will see buttons mounted in front of some of the working models. Press these and you will make the models operate. 
At the end of your visit we would welcome any comments you might have. New models are being planned all the time and any new ideas will help us design a more varied and interesting display. We would also like to know which models, if any, you thought were not up to the standard of the rest of the village. We are continually replacing and updating the models and we need to know which ones require some attention. We hope you enjoy your visit and we look forward to seeing you another day. Don't forget to tell your friends about it. ",B2,,"Welcome to the Model Village

When you first come into the Model Village, it is hard to think that a few years ago this was empty land. It was flat and full of weeds. For a long time, people thought this land was not useful. One man, with his wife's help, had a plan and worked very hard. They changed this land into the beautiful place you see now.

To make the land not flat, workers moved a lot of soil and clay. Big machines helped, but people also worked very hard. After that, they brought in good soil to make the gardens, flowers, and rock areas.

For the Model Village, people planted many trees and plants. They had to choose the right ones for this place. The plants must be strong because they are near the sea and the air has salt. They also must survive strong winter winds. Most plants came from nearby garden shops, but some came from far away, like Canada and New Zealand.

Colin Sims thought of the whole village. He made all the models himself. There are more than 100 models. It took him nine years to make them, starting in 1972. He used different things to build them—stone, concrete, special wood, and plastic. This is so they can stay outside in all weather. At first, Colin asked experts for help to learn about materials. But soon, he learned how to do it himself.

You will see that all the models are the same size and have many small details. This was done with a lot of patience and special ways of building. The Model Village is very popular. People like it because it is made and looked after very well. Other model villages in England now use these same building ways. Some schools even teach them.

All the model buildings show old British styles. They are not copies of one real place. One very nice building is the Manor House. It looks like a stone house from the 13th century, with a brick tower and stone walls. This style is common in the West Country. As you walk, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. The mini golf is the newest thing in the village.

Please stay on the paths when you visit. Do not touch the models. If you slip, it can cause many hours of work to fix them. You can take photos, but only from the paths. You can bring your dog if it is on a short lead. To have more fun, you will see buttons near some models that move. Press the buttons to make them work.

After your visit, we would like to hear what you think. We are always planning new models. Your new ideas can help us make the village more interesting. Please tell us if you see any models that are not as good as the others. We often change and improve the models, so we need to know which ones to fix. We hope you like your visit. We hope to see you again another time. Please tell your friends about us.","Welcome to the Model Village

The whole village was the idea of Colin Sims. He also made all the models himself—over 100 of them. It took him nine years, starting from when the village first opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials, like stone, concrete, special wood, and plastics, so they can survive all weather. At first, Colin needed a lot of help from experts who explained how materials last for years in changing weather. But he soon learned and became an expert himself.

You will see that all the models are the same scale and have very small details. This was done with a lot of patience and special building methods. The Model Village is a very popular place to visit. People know it for its high quality and good care. The ways used to build these realistic models are now used in other model villages in England. They are even taught in some college classes about modelling.

All the model buildings show traditional British building styles. They are not exact copies of one real place or building. One of the most amazing buildings is the Manor House. It is a typical stone building from the 13th century, with a brick tower and stone walls. It is based on the style of manor houses you often find in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course. The mini golf is the newest part of the village.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models. If you slip, it could mean many hours of repair work for us. You can take photos, but only from the paths. You can bring dogs if they are on a short lead. To make your visit more fun, you will see buttons in front of some working models. Press them to make the models move.

At the end of your visit, we would be happy to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your new ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. Please also tell us if you think any models are not as good as the others. We are always replacing and improving models, and we need to know which ones need work. We hope you enjoy your visit and we look forward to your next one. Please tell your friends about us.",,,
160,"HAPPY HUNTING GROUND 

We're 'animal people' who enjoy the company of all kinds of creatures. Consider this typical chain of events, leading to total confusion, which began one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at work with the news that she had found a wonderful pine snake. 
'Can we keep him?' she cried. I said 'Yes, but only overnight.' We had set up a special tank for just such passers-through, overnight being long enough to admire and look them up in our well-used natural history book. 
I was late getting home. I hurriedly put a pot on to boil just as screams of 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' came from my sons' bedroom. I leapt to it. 
The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day present. (I've [line 23: beginning] heard that some mothers get [line 23: end] perfume.) Domino, with mouse feet waving from his jaws, ran round and round the bedroom that was crowded with furniture and children. 
Looking for a way out so he could enjoy his catch, Domino had so far avoided the forest of waving arms. I threw myself into the confusion and promptly tripped over something or someone to find myself on the floor. 
As I thought about dropping my full weight on Domino when he next came past, my eyes locked on the snake. It had escaped - or, more correctly, was escaping. It was pouring itself up and out and off the table and all over the floor. I crouched like a rabbit at the approach of its bullish head, and long powerful body. 
The snake and I were now both being jumped over by cat/mouse/kids in a screaming, leaping, hissing mass - the snake striking at every moment, the dog barking wildly. 
The pot boiled over in the kitchen and I raced to shut off the gas, returning to the battle with new strength. This time I successfully captured Domino by the tail, and pulled the small, damp and miraculously uninjured mouse from his growling jaws. Incidentally, the same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times during its lifetime, but eventually died of old age. 
[line 60: beginning] Encouraged by my success with the [line 60: end] cat, I looked the snake over for weak points. It didn't have any. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking backwards and forwards, but without a flute. Gradually the snake relaxed enough to drop its head on to its piled-up body, but its eyes still shone with suspicion. I eventually ever-so-slowly eased my hands beneath the piled-up snake and gradually raised myself to a kneeling position, then I stood up and walked to the very end of the garden where I gave the snake the choice of living happily ever after on the garden shed by pointing it in the direction of a handy tree. 
But when I finally gathered enough courage to release the snake's head - fully expecting it to swing instantly around to crush my face in its powerful jaws - it slid away from the tree and up over my shoulders where, like a colourful leathery shawl, it gave every sign of making itself comfortable for the winter. 
We stood in the gathering dusk, four young children, Mum and the snake. DJ, my eldest, broke the heavy silence with a scientific explanation: 'You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and fat and warm, and the shed isn't.' I had the children gather at the snake's tail end and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly and unwillingly it did so. Without a backward glance, the snake travelled smoothly up the wall to disappear over the now night-shadowed roof. 
As the last tiny bit of tail disappeared from our property, three-year old Clay sighed and said it for all of us: 'Boy, that was one big snake!' 
",B2,,"A HAPPY PLACE FOR ANIMALS

Our family loves animals. We like having all kinds of animals around. This story is about a very confusing afternoon. My daughter called me at my job. She said she found a beautiful pine snake.
""Can we keep it?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special box for animals that stay for a short time. One night is enough to look at them and learn about them in our animal book.
I came home late. I started to cook food. Then I heard my sons shout from their bedroom, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to the room.
Our cat, Domino, had our white mouse, Bianca, in his mouth. Bianca was a Mother's Day gift for me. (Some mothers get perfume.) Domino ran around the bedroom. The room was full of furniture and children.
Domino wanted to find a quiet place to eat the mouse. The children tried to catch him. I ran to help, but I fell over someone and landed on the floor.
I thought about falling on Domino when he ran by me. Then I saw the snake. It was getting out of its box. It was moving off the table and onto the floor. I stayed very still as its big head and long body came near me.
Now the snake and I were in the middle of the room. The children and the cat were jumping over us. The snake was trying to bite. The dog was barking loudly.
My food in the kitchen was boiling over. I ran to turn off the fire. Then I went back to the bedroom. This time, I caught Domino by his tail. I took the wet mouse from his mouth. The mouse was not hurt. That same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times, but it lived a long life and died when it was old.
I felt good about catching the cat. Now I looked at the snake. I wanted to catch it, but it looked strong. I sat on the floor and moved slowly back and forth like a snake-charmer. I did not have a flute. Slowly, the snake put its head down on its body, but it still watched me.
Very, very slowly, I put my hands under the snake. I stood up carefully. I walked to the end of the garden. I wanted the snake to go live in the garden shed. I pointed it toward a tree.
I was scared to let the snake go. I thought it might bite my face. But it did not go to the tree. It moved over my shoulders. It looked like a colorful leather scarf. It seemed to want to stay on me for the winter.
We all stood in the dark garden: me, my four children, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, spoke. He said, ""You know why, Mum? You are nice and fat and warm. The shed is not."" I told the children to stand near the snake's tail. They gently told the snake to move. Slowly, the snake moved away. It did not look back. It went up the wall and over the roof into the night.
When the last bit of the snake's tail was gone, my three-year-old son, Clay, spoke for everyone. He said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!""","A Place for Animals

Our family loves animals. We enjoy having all kinds of creatures around. This story is about a very confusing afternoon that started when my daughter called me at work. She told me she had found a beautiful pine snake.

""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals that stayed with us for a short time. One night was enough to look at them and learn about them in our nature book.

I came home late. I quickly started to boil some water in the kitchen. Then I heard my sons shouting from their bedroom: ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room.

The problem was with our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca. Bianca was a Mother's Day present for me. (I know some mothers get perfume.) Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the bedroom, which was full of furniture and children.

Domino was looking for a way out so he could eat his catch. He was running fast to avoid all the hands trying to catch him. I joined the chase and immediately fell over something or someone onto the floor.

As I thought about how to catch Domino, I saw the snake. It had escaped. It was moving off the table and onto the floor. I bent down low as its large head and long, strong body came towards me.

Now the snake and I were in the middle of a crazy scene. The cat with the mouse, the children, and the dog were all jumping and making noise. The snake was trying to bite, and the dog was barking loudly.

The water in the kitchen was boiling over. I ran to turn off the stove, then returned to the room with new energy. This time, I caught Domino by the tail and pulled the wet, but not hurt, mouse from his mouth. By the way, that same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times but later died when it was old.

Feeling good about catching the cat, I looked at the snake to see how to catch it. It looked very strong. Finally, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, moving slowly back and forth, but without any music. Slowly, the snake relaxed and put its head down on its body, but it still watched me carefully.

Very slowly, I put my hands under the snake and carefully stood up. I walked to the far end of the garden. I planned to let the snake go near a tree so it could live in our garden shed.

When I was brave enough to let go of the snake's head, I thought it might turn and bite me. Instead, it moved away from the tree and onto my shoulders. It lay there like a leather shawl, looking like it wanted to stay warm for the winter.

We all stood in the dark garden: me, my four children, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, broke the silence. He said, ""You know why, Mum? You are nice and fat and warm, and the shed is not."" I asked the children to stand near the snake's tail and gently tell it to move. Slowly, and not wanting to go, it did.

The snake moved smoothly up the wall and disappeared over the roof into the night. When the last bit of its tail was gone, my three-year-old, Clay, sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Wow, that was one big snake!""",,,
161,"Behind the dolphin's smile

People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas, films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. 

Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. They are among the most intelligent animals we know, they are sensitive to human emotions, and they allow us to dream of wonderful freedom out in the wild seas. 
This love affair has been encouraged by TV. First there was Flipper, and now there's Darwin, the star of Seaquest. However, these happy portrayals hide the reality of life for dolphins in the polluted and overfished seas of the 
late twentieth century.
The population of North Sea harbour porpoises (one kind of dolphin) is estimated to have been reduced by up to 89,000. You may expect such popular animals to be protected by law and taken care of in special marine reserves. This is not the case, however, and the lack of plans to look after them may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our times. 
Forty different kinds of dolphins are recognised worldwide. In the waters of northern Europe, the greatest number of dolphins are the striped, the common, the bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two generally live far out in the open sea. They are normally seen only in small groups, flashing quickly past ships, and we know very little about them. 
The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises, on the other hand, were once a common sight near to European coasts. Bottlenoses are particularly social and used to be found on the Channel coast and in river mouths in Britain, including the Thames. Resident populations can nowadays be found only in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the skin injuries found on the few that still remain indicate that they are suffering from stress. 
The complicated habits of the dolphins make it difficult to decide on the exact reasons for this reduction in numbers. The overfishing which is dramatically reducing the world's fish stocks and which is threatening to destroy local fishing industries, also threatens porpoises and dolphins. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. 
They are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them. In many modern fishing methods, huge nets are left to float or are pulled at great speed through the sea. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have been washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks, ropes and cuts on their bodies show that the main cause of death was the fact that they had been caught by such nets. 
Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies. The females then produce milk that is rich in pesticides, thus passing the poison in a concentrated fashion on to their young. There is already one recorded case of a young dolphin being poisoned and killed by its mother's milk. 
But perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is the one posed by human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet 
understand. ",B2,"The dolphin's smile

People love dolphins. We like to see them in the sea, in films, and on TV. But a group says dolphins are in danger. Mark Simmonds writes about why there are fewer dolphins.

Dolphins are special to us. They are smart animals. They feel what people feel. They make us think of freedom in the big sea.

TV shows make us love dolphins. First there was Flipper. Now there is Darwin in Seaquest. But these happy shows are not true. Dolphins live in dirty seas. People catch too many fish.

In the North Sea, there are fewer harbour porpoises. Harbour porpoises are a kind of dolphin. You might think the law helps these animals. But it does not. We do not have good plans to help them. This is bad for animals.

There are forty kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, there are striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and small harbour porpoises. The striped and common dolphins live far in the sea. We see them in small groups. They swim fast by ships. We do not know much about them.

The big grey bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises lived near the coast in Europe. Bottlenose dolphins like to be with other dolphins. They lived near the coast in Britain, like in the River Thames. Now, they only live in two places in Scotland and Wales. The dolphins that are left have marks on their skin. This shows they are not well.

It is hard to know why there are fewer dolphins. One reason is too much fishing. There are fewer fish in the sea. This is bad for dolphins because they eat fish. If there are no fish in one place, dolphins cannot find food.

Dolphins can get stuck in fishing nets. They cannot see the nets. Big nets are in the sea. Many dead dolphins are on beaches in France and Cornwall. They had marks from nets on their bodies. This is how they died.

Bad things in the sea can get into dolphins' bodies. Poison from farms can stay in their fat. Mother dolphins make milk with this poison. Baby dolphins drink the milk. One baby dolphin died from its mother's milk.

Another problem for dolphins is noise from people. Dolphins live in groups. They use sound to know their world. In the sea, noise from ships travels well. This noise may be bad for dolphins. We do not know how.","Behind the dolphin's smile

Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals. They understand people's feelings. They make us think about being free in the ocean.

TV shows make us like dolphins more. First there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy shows do not show the real life of dolphins. The sea is dirty and has fewer fish.

One kind of dolphin, the North Sea harbour porpoise, has many fewer animals now. About 89,000 are gone. You might think popular animals are safe because of rules. But this is not true. Not helping them could be a big problem.

It is hard to know why there are fewer dolphins. One reason is too much fishing. This is bad for dolphins because they eat fish. If fish are gone from a place, dolphins might not find food and could die.

Dolphins can get stuck in fishing nets. They cannot see these nets. Fishermen use big nets in the sea. In recent years, many dead dolphins were found on beaches in France and Cornwall. They had net marks on their bodies. This means the nets killed them.

Bad things in the sea, like poison from farming, can get inside dolphins. These poisons stay in their fat. When a mother dolphin feeds her baby with milk, the poison can go to the baby. One baby dolphin died from its mother's milk.

Another problem is noise from people. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand things. In the sea, noise from ships and oil wells travels far. This noise might be bad for dolphins, but we do not know how.","Behind the dolphin's smile

People really like dolphins. We love to see them at seaside places, in films and on TV. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says they are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds writes about why there are fewer dolphins now.

Dolphins are very special to us. They are some of the smartest animals we know. They seem to understand human feelings, and they make us think of a free life in the wild ocean.
TV has made us love them even more. First, there was the show ""Flipper,"" and now there is ""Seaquest"" with a dolphin named Darwin. But these happy TV stories hide the real problems for dolphins. They live in seas that are dirty and where people have caught too many fish.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) may have gone down by as many as 89,000. You might think that such popular animals are protected by law and live safely in special sea areas. Sadly, this is not true. Not having good plans to protect them could become one of the worst wildlife problems of our time.

It is hard to know exactly why there are fewer dolphins because their lives are complex. One big problem is overfishing. People are catching too many fish from the sea. This is bad for the fishing industry and also for dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If all the fish are gone from one area, they might not have enough time to find food somewhere else before they get too hungry.
They are also in danger from fishing nets. Dolphins may not be able to see these nets. In modern fishing, very big nets are used. They are left in the water or pulled very fast through the sea. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. The marks on their bodies show that most of them died because they were caught in these nets.
Dolphins can also get sick from pollution in the sea. Harmful chemicals, like pesticides, can get into their bodies. These poisons dissolve in fat. This means dolphins can't get rid of them, so the poison builds up inside them. When a mother dolphin feeds her baby with her milk, the milk can be full of these poisons. There is one known case of a baby dolphin that died because it was poisoned by its mother's milk.
But maybe the most debated danger to dolphins comes from human noise. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise from ships, oil wells, and other things travels very well—four times better than in air. This noise might be disturbing the dolphins in ways we don't yet understand.",,,
162,"Careers Advice 

You're not happy in your job at the moment, but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. 

 
The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. A summary of the findings is then given and various careers are suggested, as well as the possible retraining needed. 
I decided to try out Career Analysts, one of the largest organisations giving career advice. Taking the careers test was like being back in my science exams. I was with a group of about ten people and we were answering questions against the clock. I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometrics would give an accurate picture of me. They involved things like picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching up similar shapes in a set. 
I then had a long chat with an adviser and from this, plus the results of the test, he produced a report giving his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the adviser's conclusions, though I was a little dismayed to find out that I had done quite badly in the scientific, technical and practical tests. I am sure that a lot of sick people are glad that I never became a nurse. It was reassuring, though, to be told that I had made the correct decisions as far as journalism was concerned. 
Rethinking your career needn't involve a massive change of direction. Last March, after working as a marketing manager with a large insurance company for five years, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. 'Losing my job was the perfect opportunity for me to take a step back and look at my career to date. I wanted to re-examine the skills and interests I have,' says Donna. Some of the results were surprising. 'I hadn't realised that I had such a gift for design. But in the end I had to balance the cost of retraining in design against my financial commitments,' she says. Other suggestions were put forward, such as taking a year off and working in the Far East. 
'I decided to use the skills I already had and move into something more suited to me than insurance. I am now working as a Public Relations officer. I am sure I would have got to this point without Career Analysts but they helped me realise, objectively and independently, what I definitely wanted to do. I have sent half a dozen friends there, who are all happy with the service.' 
There are those who feel that they definitely would not have got to that point without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make some life-changing decisions. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I decided my job was dull and I needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I went to Career Counselling Services with a completely open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was taped, which I found very useful, as you forget many of the things you say. After the fourth meeting, having listened carefully to what the results of the tests were telling me, I made the decision that I wanted to do geology and I plan to start a degree course in it later this year. I think that the advice given by Career Counselling Services was well worth the fee. I'm a lot happier now and far more positive.' 
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I had reached a stage in my career where I didn't know where to go. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something I had never thought of. Although I was given a host of new ideas, I rejected them as they either required a substantial drop in salary or considerable retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't know/ she says. 'You have to provide the adviser with an enormous amount of personal information and I just felt that if I had told a friend the same thing, they would have given me similar advice.' ",B2,"Job Help

You are not happy with your job. You want a new job, but you do not know how to change. Kitty Doherty has some good ideas.

Many people ask a job helper. First, you write about your life. Then you do some tests. The job helper looks at the tests. Then the helper tells you about good jobs for you. The helper also says if you need to learn new things.

I went to a job helper. I did the job tests with ten other people. We answered questions. It was not a school test. You do not pass or fail. The tests had lists of names and numbers. I found mistakes. I also matched shapes.

Then I talked to a job helper for a long time. He wrote a paper. The paper had his ideas and job ideas for me. I liked most of his ideas. But I was sad because I did not do well on science tests. The helper said I am good at writing news. That was good.

You do not need a big change. Donna is 25. She worked for a big company for five years. Then she lost her job. Her friends said, ""Go to a job helper."" Donna said, ""I wanted to see what I am good at."" Some test answers were a surprise. Donna said, ""I did not know I am good at design. But learning design costs a lot of money."" The helper had other ideas. One idea was to work in another country.

Donna said, ""I use the skills I have. I now have a new job. I like it. The job helper helped me see what I want to do. I told my friends to go. They are happy too.""

Some people need help. Juliet is 26. She went to a job helper. She said, ""I worked at a bank. My job was not fun. I wanted something new. I did not know what to do. I did the tests. The tests said I like science."" She talked to a helper four times. After the tests and talks, she decided. She said, ""I want to study rocks. I will start school this year. The help was good. I am happier now.""

But job help is not for everyone. Amanda is 24. She sells things. She said, ""I did not know what job to do. I thought a job helper would have a new idea. The helper had many new ideas. But I said no. The new jobs paid less money. Or I needed to go back to school. The helper did not tell me new things about me. I told the helper many things. I think a friend could give me the same advice.""","**Careers Advice**

Are you not happy in your job? Do you want a new job but don't know how to get one? Kitty Doherty has some good ideas.

Many people who want a new job go to a careers adviser. First, you write a little about your life. Then you do some tests. These tests are called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, the adviser tells you what they found. They tell you about jobs you could do. They also talk about new learning you might need.

I went to Career Analysts. It is a big company that helps people choose jobs. I did the test with about ten other people. We had to answer questions fast. I knew it was not a test to pass or fail. In the tests, I looked for mistakes in lists of names and numbers. I also matched shapes that looked the same. I did not know how these tests could show what I am like.

Then, I talked for a long time with an adviser. He wrote a report with his ideas and jobs for me. I liked most of his ideas. But I was a little sad because I did not do well in the science and practical tests. I think sick people are happy I did not become a nurse! But I was happy to hear that journalism is a good job for me.

You do not always need a very different job. Donna Laney is 25 years old. She worked for a big insurance company for five years. Then she lost her job. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts. Losing her job helped her think about what she is good at and what she likes. The test results were a surprise. She found out she is very good at design. But she had to think about the cost of new learning. The advisers also had other ideas, like taking a year away to work in Asia.

Donna decided to use the skills she already had. Now she works in Public Relations. She thinks this job is better for her than insurance. She says Career Analysts helped her see what she wanted to do. She is happy and told her friends to go there.

Other people also say the advice helped them a lot. Juliet Greene is 26. She went to Career Counselling Services. She worked for a big bank for six years, but her job was boring. She wanted to do something new. She did the tests and found out she likes science. She met with an adviser four times. She recorded one meeting, and this helped her remember things. After thinking about the test results, she decided to study geology. She will start a university course this year. She is very happy she went and thinks the advice was good for the money.

But careers advice does not help everyone. Amanda Margetts is 24 and sells things. She did not know what to do next in her job. She thought an adviser could give her a new idea. The adviser gave her many new ideas, but Amanda did not want them. The new jobs paid less money or needed a lot of new learning. She did not learn anything new about herself. She also had to tell the adviser many things about her life. She thinks a good friend could have told her the same things.","**Careers Advice**

Are you not happy in your job right now, but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty has some good advice.

More and more people who want a new job are asking a careers adviser for help. First, you write a short story about yourself. Then you do some tests called 'psychometrics'. After that, you get a summary of the results. The adviser suggests different jobs you could do and any new training you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a big company that gives careers advice. Doing the test felt like being in a science exam again. I was in a group of about ten people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was difficult to understand how these tests could show who I really am. For example, I had to find mistakes in lists of names and numbers and match shapes that looked the same.

Later, I had a long talk with an adviser. Using our conversation and the test results, he wrote a report with his ideas and suggestions. I agreed with most of his conclusions. But I was a little sad to see that I did quite badly in the science, technical, and practical tests. I'm sure many sick people are happy I didn't become a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I had made the right choice to work in journalism.

Changing your career doesn't always mean doing something completely different. Last March, Donna Laney, who is 25, lost her job. She had worked as a marketing manager for a large insurance company for five years. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts. ""Losing my job was a good chance for me to stop and think about my career,"" says Donna. ""I wanted to look again at my skills and interests."" Some of the results were a surprise. ""I didn't know I was so good at design. But in the end, I had to think about the cost of new training and the money I needed for my life,"" she says. The adviser also had other ideas, like taking a year off to work in the Far East.

""I decided to use the skills I already had and find a job that suited me better than insurance. I now work as a Public Relations officer. I think I would have found this job without Career Analysts, but they helped me see, in a clear and independent way, what I really wanted to do. I have sent six friends to them, and they are all happy with the help they got.""

Some people feel sure they would not have found a new path without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services helped 26-year-old Juliet Greene make some big decisions about her life. ""After working for a big bank for six years, I thought my job was boring and I needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I did the tests, and they showed I was interested in science,"" she says. ""I had four meetings with an adviser. We recorded the third meeting, which was very useful because you forget a lot of what you say. After the fourth meeting, I thought carefully about the test results and decided I wanted to study geology. I plan to start a university course in it later this year. I think the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. I am much happier now and feel more positive about the future.""

However, careers advice doesn't help everyone. Amanda Margetts is a 24-year-old sales representative. She says, ""I was at a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something I hadn't thought of. I was given many new ideas, but I said no to them because they meant I would earn much less money or I needed a lot of new training. The adviser didn't tell me anything new about myself. You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information. I felt that if I had told a friend all the same things, they would have given me similar advice.""",,,
163,"ICE SKATING 

Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes, skating was seen as an essential skill. 
In the early twentieth century, skating was stylish and reserved, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11- year-old Sonja Henie introduced a more athletic attitude which inspired a new wave of popularity. Nowadays art and athletics are combined and modern skating is both graceful and physically demanding. 
For the beginner, balance and control are all important and speed can only increase with proficiency. The position of your body plays a great part in balance. Legs slightly bowed and the knees bent keep the body weight centred; in effect the body leans slightly forward in this position. For skating, probably more than any other sport or recreation, relaxation is vital.
For the starting position, the heels should almost be touching and the feet should be turned outwards. While pushing forward with the back foot, you make a very small movement with the other foot. Fairly easy, isn't it? If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. 
Knowing how to fall must be learnt among the skater's first skills. Even the best of the professionals fall. In order to fall without injury, you should be as relaxed as possible. In this way the shock of hitting the ice is lessened. To get up, use your hands to get into a kneeling position, then stand. 
Once you have learnt to move on the ice with confidence, there are various styles to be practised - figure skating, free style, distance, speed, skating in pairs, and so on - but the basis of them all, and by far the best approach, is first to learn figure skating and then elementary freestyle. With proper guidance available at most of the ice rinks throughout the country, the basic figures can soon be learnt and the turns, jumps and spins of elementary free style will soon follow. 
If you look at any good or professional skater, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this an exercise programme should be regularly practised. It can be dangerous to skate with a stiff body and warm-up exercises should at least include those for the legs, back and shoulders, with special emphasis on the ankles and the knees. After a long or intense session, the same exercises should be used afterwards to avoid stiffness. 
Skating improves balance, co-ordination, relaxation and movement. It improves heart and lung activity and generally strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness. ",B2,,"Ice skating has a long history. People used skates made from animal bones long ago. Later, they started using iron for skates. In some countries, rich people thought skating was an important skill to learn.

In the 1900s, skating became very popular. A young girl named Sonja Henie skated in the Olympics and showed a new, sporty style. Today, skating is both beautiful and very athletic.

If you are new to skating, you need to learn balance and control. You should not try to go fast at first. To keep your balance, bend your knees a little and lean forward slightly. It is very important to stay relaxed when you skate.

To start, put your heels close together and point your feet out. Push with one foot and move the other foot forward a little. It is not too hard, right? When you can do this, you can make your movements bigger as you get better.

All skaters fall, even experts. You must learn how to fall safely. Try to stay relaxed when you fall so it does not hurt as much. To stand up, go on your knees first, then use your hands to help you stand.

When you feel good on the ice, you can try different types of skating. You can do figure skating, skate fast, or skate with a partner. It is best to learn figure skating first. Most ice rinks have teachers who can show you the basic moves. Soon you can learn turns and jumps.

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate like this, you should do exercises often. Before you skate, always warm up your legs, back, and shoulders. Pay special attention to your ankles and knees. After skating, do these exercises again so your body does not feel stiff.

Skating is good for your health. It helps your balance and makes your body stronger. It is also good for your heart and lungs. If you also swim or run, skating can be part of a great plan to stay healthy and fit.","Ice skating has a very long history. People have found old skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until people in Scandinavia started using iron around the year 200. For rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill to learn.

In the early 1900s, skating was formal and careful. But at the 1924 Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie skated in a more athletic way. This made skating popular in a new way. Today, skating mixes art and sport. It is both beautiful and physically difficult.

For beginners, balance and control are the most important things. You can only go faster when you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly apart and your knees bent. This keeps your weight in the middle. Your body should lean a little forward. For skating, it is very important to be relaxed.

To start, put your heels close together and turn your feet outwards. Push forward with one foot while you move the other foot a little. It's quite easy, right? When you can do this, you can slowly make your movements longer as you improve.

Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should learn. Even professional skaters fall. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This makes hitting the ice less painful. To get up, use your hands to go onto your knees, then stand.

Once you can move on the ice with confidence, you can try different styles. These include figure skating, freestyle, speed skating, and skating with a partner. The best way to start is to learn figure skating first, then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basic moves. After that, you can learn turns, jumps, and spins.

If you watch good skaters, you will see how relaxed and smooth they are. To skate like this, you should do regular exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous. Before you skate, always warm up your legs, back, and shoulders. Pay special attention to your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises again to avoid feeling stiff.

Skating helps your balance, coordination, and how you move. It makes your heart and lungs stronger and improves your overall fitness. If you also swim or jog, skating can be part of a great plan for your health.",,,
164,"Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km and then run 1Okm? Because 'it's fun'. 

Teenager with a taste for endurance 

WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). Ability to do all three without a rest essential. 

The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping. Great for those watching, maybe, but what makes the triathletes want to punish their bodies so much? And what makes an attractive 17-year-old, with excellent academic results, give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers? 
Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes automatically use when asked similar questions. 'You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 1Okm, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,' she says. 
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. 'I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went round.' Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. 'I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realised then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the running.' 
But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. 'Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be [line 35: beginning] tempted to do it again.' Such doggedness draws [line 35: end] admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. 'I've just been testing her fitness,' he says, 'and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realise they can't go any further, she just kept on.' 
Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with PS1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. 
But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.' What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? 'No, what sort of times they are achieving.' 
Where will all this single-mindedness end? Melanie has tried other events. She has had a go at the triathlon 'sprint', for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. 'The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,' she says. Funny, that. ",B2,,"Why does a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, ride a bike 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun.""

A Teenager Who Loves Hard Sports

WANTED: A girl who loves sports to train with. You can train with someone who may win the Olympics one day. You must like long runs (often 15 km), long swims (it helps if you like swimming in cold rivers in winter), and long bike rides (it is good if you like 100 km rides). You must do all three without a rest.

The triathlon is a popular Olympic sport. Many people come to watch. They are surprised to see people swim, then bike, then run without stopping. It is fun to watch, but why do the athletes do this hard sport? And why does a nice 17-year-old girl, who is good at school, stop doing other things for it?

Melanie Sears is 17. She does not use big words like other athletes. She says, ""First you swim 1500m. Then you get out of the water and get on your bike. You are wet, so you get cold. After the 40km bike ride, you run 10km. It is a long way when you are tired. But it is fun, and it feels good after.""

Melanie did her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the race for young people, but I was the only young person. It was easy. I waved to my friends while I did it."" Then she joined a big national race. She swam fast and ran fast, but she did not win. ""I followed a man and we went the wrong way. We went to the sea. I rode my bike 20 km too far. I cried when I ran.""

But she did not stop. She says she will never stop. ""Sometimes I want to stop because it hurts. But I am scared that if I stop one time, I will stop again."" Her coach, Steve Trew, thinks she is very strong. ""I was testing her,"" he says. ""She worked so hard on the running machine that she fell off. Most people stop when they are tired, but she did not stop.""

This year, Melanie was the best young person in the European Triathlon. She was number 13. ""I swam and ran almost as fast as the best three, but I biked slower. So now I work hard on biking."" Her parents are paying for her trip to the World Championships in New Zealand. Now she wants them to buy her a new bike. It costs less money now. She wants to use the bike for other races.

But there is another thing. Her training is very hard, so she does not go out with friends. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I don't like parties. After two hours of swimming on Friday, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about their race times.""

What will happen next? Melanie has tried shorter races. She wants to try sports that are even harder than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. That is a funny problem.","Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun.""

A Teenager Who Loves Long-Distance Sports

WANTED: A training partner for a young triathlete. Must love sports, and it is better if you are a girl. You will work with someone who could become an Olympic champion one day. You should really enjoy long-distance running (regular 15 km runs), long-distance swimming (it helps if you don't mind training in cold rivers in winter), and long-distance cycling (it is good if you like 100 km rides). You must be able to do all three sports without a break.

And why would a nice 17-year-old girl, who is also very good at school, give up everything for this difficult sport?

Melanie Sears does not use the common answers about personal goals and challenges that most athletes give. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then you get out of the water and get on your bike while you are still wet. Of course, you get very cold. After the 40km cycle, you have to run 10km. That is a long way when you are very tired. But it is great fun, and in the end, it is all worth it.""

Melanie did her first triathlon when she was 14. ""I won the junior part—but I was the only junior there. It felt so easy that I waved to my friends as I went.""

Her strong will makes Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director, admire her. ""I was just testing her fitness,"" he says. ""She worked so hard on the running machine that it finally pushed her off and she hit a wall. She gave it all her energy. Most people stop when they know they can't continue, but she just kept going.""

165,"Visit to Malaysia

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival, and spends a nervous night in the forest. 

Adnan Ali smiled broadly as I presented him with his torn kite. 'You have to keep it,' he said, 'it's traditional - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and anyway, I've plenty more.' He indicated a pile of intricately decorated kites at his feet. All were precisely 120cm wide and long, and made of tissue paper and split bamboo. 
We sat down next to them in the shade of the whispering coniferous trees that are behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in the state of Kelantan, and looked out over Malaysia's biggest and most serious kite festival.
In the centre of the beach stood 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a row of tense competitors holding the lines of their kites waited for the countdown. On the blast of the whistle, the crowd roared and the kites rose into the air like rockets. 
More than 500 men and boys had registered for the competition, which runs for five days every year. Each had entered four different designs which were to be judged on decoration, stability in the air and flying efficiency. 
'Flying kites isn't so difficult,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' The invitation was one of five I'd received that day, and I decided to accept. 
Back in his house I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As dusk fell, he told me to come again the next day to start rebuilding his kite but my plans didn't allow it. 
Instead I explored the southern half of the state, pointing my car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur, into granite mountains dripping with luxuriant rainforest. I took a wrong turning and the smooth road ended suddenly at a river. 
A needle-shaped boat was waiting to ferry pedestrians across. Near it, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' 
Before setting off, it would have been useful to know that nearly all of this distance was uphill, steep and slippery. When I got to the track, however, I found a chap waiting with a flask of tea. 
This was Baba, who looked after a tented kitchen and a dozen or so bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, determined not to think twice about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 
Night was totally black, full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby and thousands of living things moved and squeaked. In the morning there was a tremendous view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon it rained. 
First wind, then lightning lashed the treetops. Seconds later I was wet through. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the scores of giant butterflies avoided the enormous drops. 
Other thoughts included the possibility of my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the likelihood of drowning if I opened my mouth. Fortunately the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 
No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone fired questions at me: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' 
But in the asking there was nothing but friendliness. Kelantan might be best known for its kites but I remember it more for its human kindness. ",B2,,"A Trip to Malaysia

Paul Forster goes to a kite festival. He also has a scary night in the forest.

I gave Adnan Ali his broken kite. He smiled. ""You keep it,"" he said. ""This is our tradition. If the string breaks, you find the kite, you keep it. I have many more kites."" He pointed to a pile of beautiful kites near his feet. All the kites were the same size. They were made from paper and bamboo.

We sat under some trees. The trees were behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan. We watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival.

On the beach, there were 10 stands. Helpers held the kites. People waited with their kite strings. A whistle blew. Then the kites flew up into the sky very quickly.

More than 500 men and boys were in the competition. It happens for five days every year. Each person had four kites. Judges looked at the kites. They looked at how beautiful they were and how well they flew.

""Flying kites is not hard,"" Adnan said. ""But making them is difficult. Come to my house. I can show you how to make one."" I got five invitations that day. I said yes to his invitation.

Later, I was at his house. I drank cold, milky tea and ate fish crackers. When it became dark, he asked me to come back the next day. He wanted to fix the kite together. But I could not go. I had other plans.

The next day, I drove to the south part of the state. I drove towards Kuala Lumpur. I went into mountains with a big, green forest. I made a wrong turn. The good road ended at a river.

A long, thin boat was there. It takes people across the river. I saw a small sign. The sign pointed to a path into the forest. It said: ""Jelawang Jungle - 3 km.""

I did not know the path went up a big hill. I did not know it was very slippery. At the start of the path, a man was waiting. He had some tea.

His name was Baba. He had a kitchen in a tent and some small bamboo huts. I decided to stay there for the night. I tried not to think about insects under my thin bed.

The night was completely black. There were many sounds. A waterfall was very loud. Many animals moved and made noises. In the morning, I saw a wonderful view of many green mountains. In the afternoon, it started to rain.

First, the wind was strong. Then, there was lightning. Very soon, I was completely wet. I walked carefully down the hill. I saw many large butterflies. I did not understand how they stayed dry in the rain.

I thought about my car. I thought it might be gone. This sometimes happens here. I also thought I might swallow too much water if I opened my mouth. But my car was still there at the end of the path. It was very dirty.

Later, I was in Kota Bahru. This is the main city in Kelantan. People asked me many questions. They asked, ""Where are you from?"" and ""How old are you?""

But everyone was very friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I will remember it for its kind people.","A Trip to Malaysia

166,"What sort of shopper are you? 

Love it or hate it, we all go shopping. But there are different types of shopper. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around ... 

A. Melanie, 22, dancer

I'm an addict - I can't spend enough money! When I have the cash I'm out there and then I don't get miserable. I definitely have difficulty walking past sale signs. My boyfriend's exactly the same, so we often drag each other around the shops. We're an addicted couple! 

B. Brenda, 40, office manager

I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he does the cooking and knows what he likes. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes ... I do take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter out to get clothes, but I don't enjoy that either, as we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself regularly, so when I do splash out I tend to feel guilty and rarely tell my husband how much I've spent - I always knock the price down a bit! The real price always sounds so shocking. 

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager

I only shop for essentials I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and I won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something I'd rather be doing. 

D. Anita, 35, TV producer

I like a good look round every now and then but I tend to know what I want, and where to find it. I don't waste time and I get in and out as quickly as I can. I do have hidden mistakes at the back of my wardrobe though so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes gets particular purchases wrong! 

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary

I don't enjoy shopping in the least. I really dislike shopping for clothes as I can never find what I want, or anyone to help me look for it. The shops are too noisy, everything is disordered and I find it an absolute nightmare. Fortunately, I rarely have to shop for clothes as most of my clothes are given to me. As for food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and get it over and done with quickly! 

F. Lisa, 22, actress

I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I'll go out for a look around the shops with my girlfriends - and we'll often end up spending. I don't usually go out with a certain item in mind, but if something catches my eye I'll buy it. 

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant

I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't really buy very much. I usually know what I want and I seldom go crazy. I do sometimes shop to cheer myself up - but I usually end up feeling much worse because I've spent too much! 

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker 

I love shopping - but only on certain days and never on a Saturday, as it's far too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper ... I always set off with a fair idea of what I want, and I never snap things up immediately. I have to look in other shops, in case I can find a better bargain - I take ages! 

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager

I'm an unwilling shopper - maybe because I work in the city centre, the shops have lost their attraction for me. When I have to, I'll drag myself out - but I don't bother to try things on, it's far too much trouble. Clothes I buy don't always fit, but I don't mind too much and I'd rather make a few mistakes than have to go into shops and make a lot of effort! ",B2,,"What kind of shopper are you?

I don't like shopping. My husband buys most of the food because he cooks. I don't often shop for clothes. Sometimes I take my son and daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we like different things. I don't often buy things for myself. When I do, I feel bad and I don't tell my husband the real price. The real price is too high.

I only shop for things I need. I don't like shopping and only go when I must. When I shop, I know what I want and I don't buy other things. Shopping makes me tired. I always want to do something else.

D. Anita, 35, TV producer

I like to look in shops sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time. I go in and out of shops quickly. I have some clothes I don't wear, so maybe I am a careful shopper who sometimes makes mistakes.

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary

I really don't like shopping. I hate shopping for clothes because I can't find what I want and no one helps me. The shops are too loud and messy. It is a bad time for me. Luckily, I don't often need to buy clothes because people give me clothes. For food, I go to the supermarket once a week and finish quickly.

F. Lisa, 22, actress

I am a happy shopper. Sometimes I go to the shops with my friends and we often buy things. I don't usually go to buy one thing, but if I see something I like, I buy it.

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant

I am a careful shopper. I like going to shops, but I don't buy a lot. I usually know what I want and I don't buy too much. Sometimes I shop to feel happy, but then I feel worse because I spent too much money.

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker

I love shopping, but only on some days. I never shop on Saturday because it is too busy. I am a careful shopper. I usually know what I want before I go. I don't buy things straight away. I look in other shops to find a better price. I take a long time.

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager

I don't like shopping. Maybe because I work in the city centre, the shops are not interesting for me. When I have to shop, I go, but I don't try clothes on. It is too much work. Sometimes the clothes I buy are not the right size, but I don't mind. I prefer to make some mistakes than to spend a lot of time in shops.","What kind of shopper are you?

Everyone goes shopping, whether they like it or not. But there are different kinds of shoppers. Do you know which type you are? Abby Edwards asked some people...

A. Melanie, 22, dancer

I am a shopping addict - I can't stop spending money! When I have money, I go shopping and it makes me happy. I find it very difficult to walk past a sale sign. My boyfriend is exactly the same, so we often go shopping together. We are a couple who are both addicted to shopping!

B. Brenda, 40, office manager

I am a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to buy clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don't often buy things for myself. When I do spend a lot of money, I feel guilty. I rarely tell my husband the real price because it always sounds too high.

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager

I only shop for essential things. I hate shopping and only go when I really need to. When I go shopping, I know exactly what I want and I won't accept anything else. I find shopping tiring, and there is always something else I would prefer to be doing.

D. Anita, 35, TV producer

Sometimes I enjoy looking around the shops, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don't waste time and I try to be as quick as possible. However, I have some clothes in my wardrobe that I never wear, so maybe I am a careful shopper who sometimes makes bad choices.

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary

I don't enjoy shopping at all. I really dislike clothes shopping because I can never find what I want, and there is never anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and everything is messy. It is a complete nightmare for me. Fortunately, I rarely need to shop for clothes because people give me most of my clothes. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and finish as quickly as possible.

F. Lisa, 22, actress

I think I am a happy shopper. Sometimes I go to the shops with my friends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don't usually go out planning to buy one specific item, but if I see something I like, I will buy it.

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant

I am a careful shopper. I enjoy going to the shops, but I don't actually buy very much. I usually know what I want and I rarely spend too much money. I do sometimes go shopping to make myself feel better, but I usually end up feeling worse because I've spent too much.

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker

I love shopping, but only on certain days. I never go on Saturdays because it is far too busy. I would say I am a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want before I go, and I never buy things immediately. I have to check other shops first, in case I can find a better price - it takes me a very long time!

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager

I am an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city centre, the shops have lost their appeal for me. When I have to go shopping, I force myself to go, but I don't try things on because it's too much trouble. Sometimes the clothes I buy don't fit properly, but I don't mind too much. I would rather make a few mistakes than spend a lot of time and effort in the shops.",,,
167,"Father and son start Gold Rush 

Terence and Chris Madden have travelled from Canada's frozen north to the heat of Africa in their search for nature's most desired metals. The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. 
After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced that they are just metres away from a five million dollar vein of gold. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to get a few more metres to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. 
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. Their search began after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town of the same name. While reading 19th century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the most promising area of land to study. 
Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. They then set about digging out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to form a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. 
Now they are running short of money. Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' 
As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started turning the heads of the inhabitants as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. 'It would encourage more people to come here if they are right,' said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, 'but if these two find gold I hope millions of people are not going to come and hack away at the hillside.' 
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s, when thousands were employed in hundreds of mines dotted around the countryside. One of the last remaining mines at Clogau-St David's, which produced wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. 
Now, however, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. 'Searching for gold is very emotional,' said Hall, 70. 'It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time.' ",B2,,"A father and son start a gold rush.

Terence and Chris Madden are from Canada, but now they are in Wales. They are looking for gold. The father and son think their mine in the Welsh mountains has a lot of gold.

They have been digging in the Welsh hills for ten years. They think they are very close to a lot of gold. ""We are finding gold. We just need to dig a few more metres to find more of it,"" said Terence, who is 68 years old.

They have spent their lives looking for gold. They started after the father read about gold in an area called the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. They read old books and chose a place to look.

First, they cleared the plants and found small pieces of gold in the rocks. For ten years, they got permission to work, took earth samples, and removed old cars and rubbish. Then they dug a tunnel and a deep hole.

Now they do not have much money. They spent their savings. They need to find someone to give them £50,000 to dig a few more metres. Chris says, ""This looks difficult, but we can talk to some people.""

People in the town are talking about the dig. The idea of finding gold is exciting. Dolgellau needs tourists. People are hopeful but careful. A hotel manager said, ""If they are right, more people will come here. But I hope millions of people do not come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry is not big now. It was very big in the 1880s. One of the last mines closed a month ago. It made wedding rings for the Queen.

Now, other people are also looking for gold. Another man, George Hall, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill. ""Looking for gold is very exciting,"" said Hall, who is 70. ""It is an adventure. Maybe I will be lucky this time.""","A father and son start a Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have gone from the cold north of Canada to the hot weather of Africa to look for gold. The father and son team think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold.

After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are only a few metres away from gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding a lot of gold. Now we just need to go a few more metres to where there is even more.""

The two men have spent their lives looking for gold. They started their search after the father read about gold worth millions of pounds in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area near a Welsh town with the same name. They read old mining books and newspapers at the Welsh National Library and chose the best place to look.

First, they cleared the plants and found small pieces of gold in the rocks. For the past ten years, they have asked for permission to work there, taken earth samples, and removed old cars and rubbish. Then they dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-metre deep hole.

Now they are running out of money. They have spent all their savings and need to find someone to give £50,000 to the project. They need this money to dig a few more metres to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems difficult, but we have many people we can ask.""

Last week, people in the area heard about the dig. The idea of finding gold is exciting for both the local people and the gold diggers. Dolgellau needs tourists, and people are carefully hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are right, more people would come here. But if they find gold, I hope millions of people don't come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry is much smaller now than in the late 1880s. At that time, thousands of people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, at Clogau-St David's, closed a month ago. It made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales.

Now, individual gold-diggers are coming back. George Hall, another person looking for gold, plans to dig a tunnel deep into a hill near the Maddens. Hall, who is 70, said, ""Looking for gold is very emotional. It is an adventure and exciting, like finding hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time.""",,,
168,"Onto a winner

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business.
Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico, USA, and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. They are playing the ancient game of pichenotte, one which, they insist, is unlike any other.
Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer originally from Quebec, Canada, brought the game into the USA and introduced it to his family. It wasn't long before, on just about every weekend and holiday, the family were playing the game and, as Dave says, 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he'd made out of old wooden food crates, was not forgotten and they continued to play regularly. If visitors dropped by they were often fascinated, for the game was completely unknown in southern USA.
One day, three years ago, Dave set up the ancient pichenotte board and, realising how cracked and battered it had become, decided to make a new one. This turned out to be a beauty. A relative noticed and wanted one. Then a friend wanted another. Curious as to how great the interest might be, one night the brothers took one of Dave's new game boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People there started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and pretty soon you couldn't them up from the table!'
When people started asking about the origins of the game, Dave decided to do some research. The roots, he discovered, were probably in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. That was adapted into a game called 'squails' which was played in pubs in Britain and, a century ago, British people emigrating to Canada brought the game with them. Pichenotte is the name of the French-Canadian version of the game that developed in Quebec.
Pichenotte, which can be played by two to four people, is clearly a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. Three concentric rings around the hole are worth 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Eight tiny posts present obstacles. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
When they saw how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made a couple more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money changed hands and the game's popularity grew. So much so that championships began to take place and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. With word spreading more widely, the boards began to sell as fast as the brothers could make them. Eventually, they decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time.
They set up a workshop in the garage of their house and started turning out boards. More than 450 have been produced to date. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each weighs 12kg and is lcm thick. As Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of wear.' They are available, at $595 each, from the brothers' website.
As yet, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to produce pichenotte celebrities. Nonetheless, the day is not far off when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury Mercedes rather than a saw and piles of wood. Until then, they're happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune.",B2,"Two brothers find a game from when they were children.

Dave and Norm are brothers. They are men. They live in a small house in Santa Fe, USA. They play a game from when they were children. The game is on a wood board. There are round pieces on the board. The game is called pichenotte. They say it is a good game.

Their grandfather brought the game from Canada. He showed his family the game. The family played the game on weekends. They had fun. Later, the family moved to New Mexico. They played the game a lot. People came to their house. The people liked the game. People in the USA did not know this game.

Three years ago, Dave saw the old game board was broken. He made a new board. The new board was nice. A family member saw the new board. He wanted one. Then a friend wanted one. The brothers took a new board to a bar. People at the bar said, ""I do not want to play."" But then they played. Soon, they liked the game.

People asked about the game. Dave looked for information. He found the game started in India. A game like it is in Britain. Then the game went to Canada. In Canada, the game is called pichenotte.

Pichenotte is for two to four people. It is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces. You use your finger to move the pieces. You put a piece in a small hole. You get 20 points. There are circles near the hole. You get 15, 10, or 5 points. There are small posts on the board. A game is two minutes long.

People at the bar liked the game. The brothers made more boards. They took the boards to markets. People came. People bought the game. The game was popular. Soon, there were competitions. There was a cup for the game. More people wanted to buy the boards. The brothers made the game their job.

They made a workshop in their garage. They made boards there. They made more than 450 boards. The boards are made of wood. Each board is strong. Norm says, ""They are strong because people use them a lot."" You can buy a board on their website. A board costs $595.

There are no famous pichenotte players. The game is not on TV. But one day, the brothers hope to have a nice car. Now, they play the game when they are not working. They hope the game will make them rich.","A great success

169,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS 

How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects, the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity. Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. 
The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a
sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians.
Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which tends to concentrate on the essential subjects - English, maths, basic sciences and languages - although provision can be made for students who wish to study a wider range of subjects. All five British specialist schools are independent, classes are small by normal school standards, with a high teacher/pupil ratio. Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders, leaving home to live, eat and sleep full-time at school. This means they spend their formative years in the company of others with similar aims and interests. 
What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is the cost; the fees are high (PS12,000-PS17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance, to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, specially at a very early age. Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment. They stress, however, that their main aim is to turn out 'rounded and well-balanced individuals'. 
There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress. Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years, while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed.
In addition, while most former pupils at music school feel that they benefited enormously from the range of high-quality music teaching available, many express reservations about the wisdom of restricting the academic programme, which definitely takes second place to musical activities. Many musically gifted young people are also highly intelligent, well able to deal with academic pressure, and feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. For these reasons, it may be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education. 
Those who are equally gifted academically may do very well within a less specialised environment; for instance, at a school with a first class music department, or else by combining a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience. But this option is clearly not practicable for families living out of reach of London or other major centres. ",B2,"Some children are very good at music. What can parents do? Sometimes, it is hard to know how to help these children. Parents may not see that their child needs help. The child can become sad or angry.

Most schools help children who are good at school subjects. But a child who is very good at music may need a special school. A special music school can help.

There are five special music schools in Britain. They are for children from 7 to 18 years old. These schools help children become better musicians.

Children at these schools spend a lot of time on music. They have music lessons. They play in groups. They practice every day. They also learn important school subjects like English and maths, but not as many subjects as a normal school.

The classes are small. Most children live at the school. They live with other children who also love music.

What are the problems? The schools cost a lot of money. But they can sometimes help with the cost. Also, some parents do not want their young child to live at school. The school leaders also think seven years old is very young for this school. They want the children to be happy people.

Putting a child in a special school can be hard for the child. Sometimes, a child who was good at music becomes less good when they are older. They can feel bad if they do not succeed. The schools watch the children and help them.

Many children who go to these schools are happy with the music lessons. But some think they do not learn enough school subjects. Some children are very smart and need to learn more at school. They can feel sad if they do not.

It is sometimes better to wait until the child is older to choose this school.

A very smart child who is good at music can also do well in a normal school. The school can have a good music program. Or, the child can go to a normal school and have music lessons on Saturdays. But this is difficult for families who do not live near a big city.","What can you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them get better. Sometimes, parents do not see that their child needs more help until the child becomes unhappy or difficult. Most schools can help children who are very good at school subjects. But children who are very good at music need special help. This help is not always available in a normal school, where music is not the main subject. A special music school can be a good choice for these children.

There are five special music schools in Britain. They are not very old. These schools help children from seven to eighteen years old. The children can learn a lot about music from professional musicians.

At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. For example, they have private music lessons, play in groups, and learn music theory. They also practice for many hours each day in their own rooms. The rest of the day is for normal school subjects like English, maths, and science. The classes are small, so children get more help from teachers. Most children live at the school. This means they live with other children who also love music.

What are the problems? First, these schools are very expensive. But the schools can sometimes help with money for children who are very talented. Second, not all parents want their young children to live away from home. The school leaders also think seven years old may be too young to live at school. They say their main goal is to help children become happy and balanced people.

Putting a child in a special school early can be stressful for them. Sometimes, a child who was very good at music becomes less interested as a teenager. Also, children can feel like they failed if they are under a lot of pressure to do well. But the schools watch the children carefully and give help if it is needed.

Many students from these schools say the music teaching was very good. But some say they did not like having fewer normal school lessons. Many children who are good at music are also very clever. They can feel bored if they do not have enough school work. So, it might be better to wait until the child is older and can help make the decision.

A child who is also very good at school subjects might do well in a normal school. They could go to a school with a great music program. Or, they could go to a normal school and also take music classes on Saturdays at a music college. But this is only possible for families who live near a big city like London.","**Specialist Music Schools**

What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them improve. Sometimes, parents do not see that their child needs more musical activities. This can make the child feel unhappy and behave badly.

Most schools can help children who are very good at subjects like maths or science. But they may not understand the needs of a child who is very musical. This is especially true if the school does not think music is very important. For these children, a specialist music school can be a good choice.

There are five specialist music schools in Britain. They are a new idea. Their goal is to create a supportive place for talented children aged 7 to 18. At these schools, professional musicians help the children develop their skills fully.

At a specialist music school, children spend a lot of time on music. About one third to half of their day is for musical activities. This includes private lessons for their main instruments, playing in orchestras or small groups, and learning music theory. They also practice for several hours each day in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. For their other school subjects, they study only the most important ones, like English, maths, science, and languages. However, children who want to study more subjects can sometimes do so.

All five of these British schools are private. The classes are small, so children get a lot of attention from teachers. Most children at these schools are boarders. This means they live, eat, and sleep at the school, away from home. They grow up with other children who have the same goals and interests.

So, what are the problems? First, it is very expensive. The cost for boarders is between £12,000 and £17,000 a year. But the schools try to help with scholarships and other money for very talented children. Second, not all parents want their young children to go to a boarding school. Even the school leaders are not sure if it is a good idea for children as young as seven. They say their main goal is to create happy and balanced people.

There is no doubt that separating musical children from others at a young age can be stressful. Sometimes, a child's early musical talent disappears when they are teenagers. Also, the need to be the best can make some children feel like a failure if they are not successful. The schools watch each child's progress carefully and offer help if it is needed.

Many students who went to these schools say the music teaching was excellent. But some are not sure if it was a good idea to spend less time on normal school subjects. Many musical children are also very clever. They can handle normal school work and may feel bored if they don't get enough of it. Because of this, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can help make the decision themselves.

Children who are also very good at normal school subjects might do well in a regular school. They could go to a school with a very good music department. Or, they could go to a normal school and also get music training at a special weekend class at a music college. These classes offer private lessons with good teachers and a chance to play in groups. But this is only possible for families who live near a big city like London.",,,

Exercise is essential for mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when all around you everything seems more and more unbalanced and the world becomes ever more fast and furious. 
Don't groan because this is yet another article about fitness. The reason why there are so many is that it is seriously good for you. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It improves muscle power and promotes good posture - the way in which you hold your body when sitting or standing. It helps prevent those muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It provides quick improvement in specific problem areas such as thighs, stomach and upper arms. It improves the condition of the heart and lungs and blood circulation. 
Probably all these reasons have been thrown at you time and time again, so maybe you are bored by them and have switched off. All right then, this should make you sit up and take notice. Did you know that exercise helps to ease depression and tiredness, and that it helps to regulate sleep patterns? Also that exercise is instrumental in controlling stress? Not only this, but exercise can help to relieve certain medical conditions. 
By now you should be influenced a little by these arguments. If not, common sense alone should tell you that exercise is good for you. 
There are plenty of types of exercise you can do aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, working out with free weights, working on weight machines. There is one point you should note - training too hard and with too much weight may cause injury, so start slowly and carefully. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. 
No amount of exercise will improve your body shape if you don't have good posture. This practically determines how you look and feel. Not only is a stiff or sagging body unattractive, it also lacks energy and is more likely to suffer from minor health complaints. 
If your body tends to slouch, imagine that the top of your head is connected to a helium balloon, which is trying to pull you up into the sky. This will help you to lift the chest for fuller and easier breathing. At the same time, it lengthens the abdomen, making the body look much slimmer. If the chest is well balanced when you are standing, you can see your ankles. 
Stretching the muscles improves flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely. 
The best exercise, therefore, involves a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout and definitely a cool down period. ",B2,"Moving your body is good. It helps your mind and body. It makes you feel happy.

Many people say to exercise because it is good for you. You should move your body. It makes your muscles strong. It helps you stand up straight. It is good for your heart.

Exercise helps you feel happy. It helps you sleep well. It helps you feel less stress.

You can exercise in many ways. You can walk fast. You can run. You can lift light things. Start slow. Do not go too fast. You can get hurt. Ask a doctor what is good for you.

Stand up straight. This helps you look good and feel good. If you bend over, try to stand tall. Think of a balloon pulling your head up. This helps you breathe better.

Stretch your body. It helps you move easily. It stops you from getting hurt. Stretch four or five times each week. Do it slowly.

Good exercise has four parts: start slow, stretch, move a lot, then cool down.","Getting Fit

Exercise is good for your mind and body. It helps you feel balanced when life is busy. You might think you have read a lot about fitness. But there are many articles because exercise is very important for you.

There are many good reasons to exercise. It makes your muscles stronger. It helps you stand and sit up straight. This can stop you from getting hurt. Exercise can also make your legs, stomach, and arms look better. It is good for your heart and lungs and helps your blood move around your body.

Maybe you have heard these things before. But did you know exercise can also help you feel less sad or tired? It can help you sleep better and feel less stressed. It can even help with some health problems.

If you are still not sure, just remember: exercise is good for you.

You can do many kinds of exercise. You can do aerobics, jog, or lift weights. But be careful. If you train too hard, you could get hurt. Start slowly. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor.

Good posture is also very important. This is how you hold your body when you stand or sit. If your posture is bad, you might not look good and you might feel tired. To stand up straight, imagine a balloon is pulling the top of your head up. This helps you breathe better and makes your stomach look flatter.

Stretching is important too. It makes your body more flexible. This helps you move easily and stops injuries. Try to stretch four or five times a week. Do the stretches slowly and carefully.

So, a good exercise plan has a warm-up, some stretching, active exercise, and a cool-down.","Staying Healthy

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced when life is busy and the world feels stressful.

You may have read many articles about fitness, but there is a good reason for this: it is really good for you. There are many reasons why you should exercise and very few reasons not to. Exercise makes your muscles stronger and can change your body shape. It helps you have better posture, which means how you hold your body when you sit or stand. This can prevent injuries. It can also improve specific areas like your legs, stomach, and arms. Exercise is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You have probably heard these reasons before. But here is something new: exercise can help you feel less sad or tired. It helps you sleep better and reduces stress. It can even help with some health problems.

By now, you might be a little more interested. If not, just remember that common sense tells us exercise is good for you.

There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, you should be careful. Training too hard or with heavy weights can cause injury, so start slowly. If you are not sure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is also very important for how you look and feel. A body that is stiff or slouching does not look good and can make you feel tired or cause small health problems.

If you often slouch, try to imagine a balloon pulling the top of your head up. This will help you lift your chest to breathe better and make your body look slimmer. When you stand correctly, you should be able to see your feet.

Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps you move more easily. It also helps you keep good posture and prevents injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, your body will become more flexible. Always stretch slowly and carefully.

So, a good exercise plan should include a warm-up, stretching, an active workout, and a cool-down.",,,

THE NATIONAL TRUST 

The National Trust is an organisation whose aim is to conserve the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to one of the wardens employed by the Trust to look after the beautiful areas it owns. 

Common sense. That's what a National Trust Warden needs, according to Gareth Roberts. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're continually dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists and building firms.' 
Gareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he married. About 80 people applied for the post as National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience won him the job, despite his lack of formal training. 
'I find it particularly helpful that I still farm with my parents and that I can deal with farmers on the same level and be aware of their problems. Also, they can't take me in about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he is well able to cope with the physical demands of the job - erecting fences, planting trees, building walls. 
Since he has been with the Trust, Gareth says he has come to understand more about nature conservation. 'When I was a youngster,' he recalls, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae and old birds' nests. And I thought to myself recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's really become clear to me that farming has affected the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' 
Gareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were set against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way.Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at the crossroads and there's just a small step needed to join them together,' says Gareth. 
Conservation is one of the main aspects of Gareth's work, along with public entry to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects completed, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills and so on.' 
Gareth is certainly keen on his job and despite never being off duty, he obviously enjoys every minute of his work, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just walk into the area, demand everything, then walk out again as if it's their absolute right. Having to be nice to those people gets on my nerves!' 
But as Gareth says, it's all down to common sense really.So if you've got plenty of that, and you like the idea of an outdoor job, you might think of applying to become a warden like Gareth - but don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a good many years! ",B2,,,"Looking after the countryside

THE NATIONAL TRUST

The National Trust is a group that works to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks to Gareth Roberts, one of the wardens who looks after the beautiful places the Trust owns.

Common sense. That’s what a National Trust Warden needs, says Gareth Roberts. ""You also need to be good with people, because you talk to farmers, visitors, nature lovers, and building workers every day.""

Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the job of warden there. In the end, Gareth got the job because he knew the area well and had farming experience, even without special training.

""I find it useful that I still work on the farm with my parents,"" he says. ""I can talk to farmers as an equal and understand their problems. They can’t trick me!"" His farming life also helps him with the physical work — putting up fences, planting trees, and building walls.

Since he started working for the Trust, Gareth says he has learned more about protecting nature. ""When I was young,"" he remembers, ""I used to pick flowers and press them, collect butterfly eggs and old birds’ nests. But now, where are all those flowers, nests, and grasshoppers? I understand now that farming has changed the countryside. It’s not the farmers’ fault — they were only doing what the government asked.""

Gareth says that when he began his job, farmers and nature protectors did not agree. Each side wanted things done their way. Now they are talking and starting to understand each other. ""We are at a turning point,"" says Gareth. ""We only need to take one small step to bring them together.""

Gareth’s main jobs are nature protection, letting the public visit Trust land, planting and looking after trees, and meeting farmers who rent land from the Trust. ""My job is to make sure work gets done with as little trouble and cost as possible. I like seeing projects finished, but about half my time is spent writing reports and signing papers.""

Gareth really likes his job. Even though he is always on duty, he enjoys his work, especially talking to visitors. Well, most of them. ""It’s the way some people behave that I don’t like,"" he says. ""They walk in, ask for everything, and act as if it’s their right. Being polite to those people can be annoying!""

But as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. So if you have plenty of that and you like the idea of working outside, you could think about becoming a warden like Gareth — but don’t expect a job on the Lleyn Peninsula for many years to come",,,
173,"Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art 

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. [line 6: end]
The mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer and worship, is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti. 
Jean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, 'People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.' 
He describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs. 
'When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture: he said. 'The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.' 
Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings,or even their names, in the rocks. 
But experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings.Henry de Lumley,director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says,not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced. 
Clottes disagrees. 'The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,' he said. 'The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.'
David Lavergne,the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. 'Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,' he said. 'Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.' 
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach - tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles - the damage will increase rapidly.She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides.'You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money: she said. 'That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation.'",B2,,"Ancient rock art in the French Alps is being damaged by tourists. There are thousands of old pictures on the rocks at Mont Bego. These pictures show animals, fields, and gods. But visitors are harming them.

People write on the rocks. They walk on the drawings. Some take pieces of rock home. Visitors rub the drawings to see them better. Others use sticks to make new marks.

Experts want to save the art, but they have different ideas. One expert says to close the mountain. Only tours with a guide should be allowed. Another expert says this is too strict. People who live there will not like this idea.

A local leader says they have no money for guards. They might ask visitors to pay money. Another expert says the mountain is now easier to visit. The damage is getting worse. She says they must close the area and have guides. They need money because this place is important for our children.","Ancient rock art in the French Alps is being damaged by tourists. Mont Bego has 36,000 very old pictures on its rocks. These drawings are about 4,000 years old and show animals, farms, and gods. But visitors are destroying them.

Experts are worried. Jean Clottes, a rock art expert, says that people think the art will always be there, but it is disappearing fast. He has seen people walking on the drawings and even breaking pieces off to take home. Some visitors rub the art to make it clearer for photos. Others use sharp sticks to scratch their own names or pictures onto the rocks.

People disagree about how to protect the art. Henry de Lumley, from a Paris museum, thinks the mountain should be closed. He says only guided tours should be allowed. But Jean Clottes thinks this idea is too strict and will make local people unhappy.

David Lavergne, a local official, wants to keep the site open. He says the area is very big, so it is hard to stop all the damage. He thinks they need more guards, but there is no money to pay for them. They might have to ask visitors to pay a fee.

Another expert, Annie Echassoux, is also worried. It is now easier for tourists to reach the mountain by car, so more damage is happening. She believes the only answer is to put ropes around the art and provide guides. She says the government must find the money because the site is a historic monument. If nothing is done, these ancient drawings will be lost for our children.",,,
174,"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain. 

Kendra Slowinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. 'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 
'I'm too involved in what I'm doing - concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else. I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 
'I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them.' These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part.
'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.' 
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the 
opening ceremony.
'As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.'
The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.'
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra. 
'But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.'
Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing. 
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.' 
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. 'So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned. '
Doubtless she will coach young players in the future, but at the moment her eyes are firmly set on her last big event. As she leads out her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is more than likely to have a tear in her eye.",B2,,"The Netball Captain

In our stories about women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain.

Kendra Slowinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a normal day. She teaches at a school and then trains in a supermarket car park. ""Do people look at you?"" I asked.
""I only think about my training. I don't see other things. Sometimes cars go slow, but that's all,"" she said.
""My life now is about being my best for the World Championships,"" says Kendra. ""I follow a strict plan to be very fit."" This is her fourth World Championships. It will be the biggest ever with 27 countries playing.
""People at home will support us. That is very special,"" she says. ""It's important that more people in this country like netball. Because we play here, people will expect us to play well.""
Their first game is against Barbados after the opening ceremony.
""I think we always beat them before. They will be fun to play. They are good players.""
The England team is number four in the world. But Kendra says the World Championships will be hard. ""You must try very hard every day. There is no rest between games. You only have one chance to win.""
Kendra has played for 15 years. The sport is now faster. Players are stronger on court. ""We train to win,"" says Kendra. ""But when the game finishes, we are friends again.""
Netball now uses science to check fitness. ""We must all think and train like the best players,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need to be strong and show others how to play. My job is to help the team.""
""My netball life was always planned,"" she says. ""I decided this will be my last game.""
She will probably teach young players later, but now she only thinks about her last big competition. When she walks with her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably cry a little.","The Netball Captain

In our stories about women in sport, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain.

Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a normal day before next month's World Championships. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. ""Do people look at you strangely?"" I asked.
""I think only about my training - how I move my body and feet. I don't see other things. Sometimes I see cars slow down, but that's all,"" she said.
""My life now is about being my best for the Championships,"" says Kendra. ""I follow a strict plan to become very fit.""
This is her fourth World Championships and it will be the biggest one, with 27 countries playing.
""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she says. ""It's important that people in this country think better of netball. Because we are playing here, there will be more pressure than usual. People will expect us to play well and will support us more. They will want us to start the tournament with a good game.""
Their first game is against Barbados right after the opening ceremony.
""I think we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They are very good players.""
The England team is fourth in the world now. But Kendra says the World Championships will be difficult. ""You must try very hard every day. There are no breaks between games like in other competitions. In other tournaments you can lose the first game and still win. But this is different because you only have one chance and you must be ready.""
Kendra has played netball at the top level for fifteen years. The sport has become faster and more difficult. Players are stronger on court. ""We train so much because we want to win,"" says Kendra. ""But when the game finishes, we become different people. We are all friendly after the game.""
Netball now uses more science to test players' fitness. ""We all need to think and train like the best players in the world,"" says Kendra. ""As captain, I need to be strong in my mind and show others how to behave. My job is to help and support the team.""
""My netball career has always been carefully planned from the start,"" she says. ""So I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last one as a player.""
She will probably teach young players in the future, but now she is only thinking about her last big competition. When she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears in her eyes.",,,
175,"Interview Tips

First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' 
As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's
what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.'
Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for
the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' 
Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. 
It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' 
Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' 
Businessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points.' ",B2,,,"Interview Tips

The first time you meet someone, they quickly form an opinion about you. In the first few minutes, people notice how you dress, if you look at them, how you move, and how you speak. They also listen to the words you use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, ""I worked hard for my degree. When I finished, I felt very sure of myself."" She had an interview for a job at a local school. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. ""I wanted to change, but I knew I would be late, and I think it is important to be on time,"" she remembers. Mary did not get the job. Later, a friend who works at the school told her what the Head Teacher said: ""If a person does not try to look good for an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says: ""People who look after their appearance often care more about their work. Many think that what is inside is most important, but in an interview, you should try to show your best side.""

But many people do not think a professional image is important. Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a large company. When her manager left, she applied for the job. She did not even get an interview. ""I thought it was wrong, so I asked the Personnel Director why,"" she says. ""He told me I did not look like a manager. He said I should wear better clothes before I try for a better job again. I was surprised. I do my job well, and my clothes should not matter.""

How you move and use your hands also affects the first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of the message about our feelings comes from our words. 38% comes from our voice, and 55% comes from our face. If your face shows something different from your words, people will believe your face. So, make sure your body language matches what you are saying. If they are different, the interviewer will be confused.

It is also important not to seem too nervous to get the job or too keen to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a better job. Her interview went very well, and they offered her the job immediately. ""I was very happy,"" she remembers. ""But I showed too much excitement. When my boss saw how excited I was, he knew I would accept any offer. Because of this, he offered me less money than I wanted. I am sure I could have got more if I had stayed calm.""

Finally, what you say and how you say it can help you succeed in an interview. David Artesio, who works at an employment agency, says it is good to learn about the company before your interview. ""For example, the company's annual report tells you what the company does. Talk about something that interests you during the interview. This shows you are interested in the company and makes a good impression.""

Business expert Marian Woodall says you should prepare some questions and avoid speaking in long, complicated sentences. She says, ""People who are not good at communicating speak in long paragraphs. People who are good at communicating use short sentences and clear points.""",,,
176,"Studio Audiences 

What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. 

Like technical difficulties,studio audiences are just another common feature of television life,and yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows, for example, we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? 
Of all the audiences for live entertainment, the studio variety is widely considered to be the lowest of the low. I have heard it said that even people who work in television treat studio audiences with scorn - or, as one cameraman put it,'like cattle'. 
I had assumed that studio audiences were made up of silly people desperate for two seconds of fame. But there's no such thing as a typical studio audience. They come from all classes, professions and income groups. Television tries to attract different types of people for different types of programme. 
Those of us who prefer to watch television from home can't see why anyone would want to watch television from a studio. Why would anyone bother to apply for tickets, travel long distances, and suffer hours of boredom in the discomfort of a studio just to watch what they can see at home? 
One theory is that people hope that for a second they might appear on television. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela: 'Why had she come?' It was a chance to appear on television.' Another theory is that people are curious to take a look behind the scenes. But the most common explanation I heard was simply a case of 'a friend gave me a ticket'. 
Few of us have ever sat in a studio audience, yet we think we can imagine what it is like. You sit there, squashed among strangers, while someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means. As one studio manager puts it, 'We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' 
But is there any real difference between what you experience in a studio and what you see on your television at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte liked the feeling of involvement with live television. 'Last year I saw my favourite comedian. When you see him on television at home you miss out on a lot.' 
What I missed out on was the sight of live actors - from where I was sitting all I could see was the back of somebody's head. The opening scenes were shot so far from where I sat that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor. Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment. ",B2,"Studio Audiences

What is it like to be in the TV show audience? Cosmo Landesman wanted to know.

TV shows have studio audiences. But many people do not know about them. On game shows, we see them. They look happy. We think: Who are they?

Some people think studio audiences are not important. Some TV workers do not like them. One man with a camera said they are ""like cows.""

I thought the people in the audience were silly. I thought they wanted to be on TV. But the audience has many kinds of people. They have different jobs. TV shows want different people.

People watch TV at home. It is easy. Why go to a TV studio? You need a ticket. You travel. You sit for a long time. You can watch the show at home.

Some people go to be on TV. I asked Angela why she came. She said, ""I want to be on TV."" Some people want to see the TV studio. But many people said, ""My friend gave me a ticket.""

Not many people go to TV shows. But we think we know what happens. You sit with people you do not know. A person shows a card. It says ""CLAP"" or ""LAUGH."" You do what the card says. This happens on some shows. A studio boss said, ""Our show is good. We do not use cards.""

Is the studio different from home? Claire said it is ""more fun."" Charlotte liked being at the live show. She said, ""I saw my favorite funny man. At home, you miss things.""

I could not see the actors well. I saw a person's head. The show was far away. I watched it on a TV in the studio. Going to a studio is not good for watching TV. But that is okay. For the people, it is fun. It is a free night out.","Studio Audiences

What is it like to be in the audience for a TV show? Cosmo Landesman wanted to find out.

Studio audiences are a normal part of TV. But many people do not understand them. When we see them on game shows, we ask: Who are these people?

Some people think studio audiences are not important. I heard that even TV workers do not always like them. One cameraman said they are treated ""like animals.""

I thought studio audiences were people who just wanted to be on TV. But there is no one type of person in the audience. They have different jobs and lives. TV shows want different people for different programs.

People who watch TV at home do not know why others go to a studio. Why get tickets, travel far, and sit for a long time in a studio? You can watch the show at home.

Some people go because they want to be on TV. I did not believe this until I spoke to Angela. I asked her, ""Why are you here?"" She said, ""I wanted to be on TV."" Other people want to see how a TV show is made. But most people told me, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit very close to people you do not know. A person holds up a sign that says ""CLAP"" or ""LAUGH,"" and you do it. This happens on some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""Our show is good, so we do not need signs.""

But is watching in a studio different from watching at home? Claire said the studio is ""more fun."" Charlotte liked being part of the show. She said, ""Last year I saw my favourite comedian. At home on TV, you miss a lot.""

I could not see the actors well. From my seat, I only saw the back of a person's head. The start of the show was far away, so I watched it on a TV in the studio. Going to a studio is not a good way to watch a show, but that is not important. For most people, it was a fun and free night out.","Studio Audiences

177,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't deal with any more foreign timetables, currencies or languages. 
'Never again,' I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and, because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learnt to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep.
Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too [line 10: beginning] anti-social, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life line 10: end] is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. 
Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen camp-site in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. 
We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organising our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money and music. 
The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the [line 29: beginning] station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. [line 29: end]
Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. 
While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is a big place, and Inter-Rail gives people the best opportunity to recognise this ... though in our case it didn't happen immediately. ",B2,,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and I had a suntan. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was very tired. My mind was tired of different train times, money, and languages.

""Never again,"" I said when I got home. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. I just had to buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month.

Sleeping on a train is different. The movement of the train helps you sleep deeply. When you carry everything in a bag on your back, you travel in a simple way. You don't keep many things. You might throw away old socks or books you have read. This is the spirit of Inter-Rail. You don't worry. You just enjoy the trip.

This train ticket is special. It lets young people travel to many countries. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know all the things we could do. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to France. But we wanted to travel more. We always wanted to see the next country. And it didn't cost more money.

We liked culture a little. But this was our first holiday without our parents. We made our own plans. We only saw the easy things to see. I was happy that in many places, I only saw the view from the train station. We just wanted to have a good time. We were the same as the other young travellers. We shared food, water, money, and music.

Travelling is exciting. A place becomes real when you arrive. It's like the city didn't exist until you saw it with your own eyes.

You need to see Europe to understand it. You need to see the different places and how people live. Everyone knows about these places, but it's not the same as seeing them yourself. That's why other people's holiday pictures are boring.

The train trip doesn't show you new things about the world, but it is a good experience for you. Europe is very big. Inter-Rail helps you understand this... but for us, it took some time.","I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and also a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail trip. My body was very tired. My mind was tired of different train times, money, and languages.

""Never again,"" I said when I arrived home. I said the same thing the next year. And the year after that. I just had to buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. A normal bed never feels the same after you learn to sleep on a train floor. The movement of the train helps you sleep deeply.

Carrying everything you own in a backpack makes travel very simple. It also makes it easy to throw things away. You might burn old socks or get rid of books after you read them. But this way of thinking is part of the Inter-Rail experience. You don't worry about being sensible. You just need that special ticket in your hand.

Any travel system that lets young people visit many countries quickly is great. On my first trip, my friends and I didn't know how much we could do with the ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in the south of France. But we couldn't stop traveling. There was always another country to see just a little further away. And the extra travel didn't cost us anything.

We liked culture a little. But this was our first holiday without our parents, like it was for most Inter-Rail travelers. When we made our plans, we only visited the easiest places to see. It was our chance to be free and do things our own way. I was happy that in many cities, I only saw the view from the train station. We just wanted to manage and have fun. We were the same as the other Inter-Railers. We shared train floors, food, water, money, and music.

Travel is exciting because a place that was just a name becomes real. It feels like the city doesn't really exist until your train arrives and you see it with your own tired eyes.

You can only understand Europe by seeing it yourself. You need to watch the landscapes change and see how people live differently. Everyone knows what is in Europe, but it doesn't mean anything until you see it. This is why other people's holiday pictures are often boring.

A train trip might not help you find something new in the world, but it is a great personal experience. Europe is very big, and Inter-Rail is the best way to understand this... although for us, it took some time to realize it.",,,
178,"Drop me a line! 

In our fast world of phones, fax machines and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet, to me, there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. 
Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother, also, always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. 
When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a 
week, and so would my mother. Occasionally my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls but it is the letters I remember most. 
There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. 
Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice and she has stayed with us. 
My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer, when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. 
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organised by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 
'lost art'. ",B2,,"Write to me!

In our busy world with phones and computers, people are writing fewer letters. But for me, getting a letter is very special. I love waiting for it, seeing who sent it, and reading what is inside.

I have written letters all my life. It started when I wrote short notes to my mother. My mother always told me to write thank you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It was okay if the letters were short or messy.

When I was 18, I moved to London to learn to be a doctor. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote to me. Sometimes my father wrote too. I loved his long, funny letters. Most letters from home talked about simple things my parents and their friends did. We also talked on the phone, but I remember the letters best.

I also got letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, the people I liked often lived far away. We could only talk by writing letters. Writing letters made our relationships better. I found it easier to say what I felt in a letter than by speaking.

I love getting letters inside birthday or Christmas cards. A short note is nice, but a long letter with lots of news is much better! I also love getting letters from other countries with nice stamps. I get letters from a friend in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Canada.

I also write to a woman in France. We met in a restaurant on holiday. My husband took her photo, and I asked for her address. I am happy she wrote back. Now we write to each other often. I can practice my French with her. We have stayed at her house twice, and she has stayed with us.

My best letter story happened this summer. My family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We wrote letters for 29 years but never met. People were surprised our friendship lasted so long. A local newspaper even wrote a story about us on the front page.

I am happy my children also write letters. Like my mother, I tell them to write their own thank you letters. My daughter writes me little notes, just like I did for my mother. My daughter and son have their own penfriends in Texas. I really hope people do not stop writing letters. We should not let it become a thing of the past.",,,,
179,"Dedicated to their sports

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
A Darius (runner)
I've always been sporty. I played a bit of everything at one time, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial for a professional football club, but eventually I opted to go down the athletics route instead. My biggest moment came when I got to compete for my country in the youth team and got a medal. It didn't result in much media attention, though, which was a shame. I'd been hoping some sponsorship would come out of it, because the training doesn't come cheap. I train at home all winter and then go away for three weeks, usually Florida, before the season starts. It's good fun - there are great athletics facilities there and the nightlife's great too. You've got to be really disciplined, though. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication pays in this sport. The main goal for me is to get to the next Olympics -that would be fantastic.

B Gabriel (surfer)
The surfing community is small, so you get to meet the same guys wherever you compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn, so if you're really going to get anywhere, you have to cut out late-night parties altogether. I don't mind that so much, but I do love having a lie-in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it,because without that kind of dedication I might not have won the National Championships last year. I make sure that a big night out follows any win, though, and if there's cash involved in the winnings, I'll go away somewhere really nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning that championship meant I got picked to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

With five lads on a boat together, you have a good laugh. We're very traditional and we always celebrate a win in great style. It's been said that we act a bit childishly when we're out, but we don't actively go looking for media coverage. Sometimes the reporters actually seem more concerned about where you go out celebrating and what you get up to there than about where you came in the race. I'm away for eight months of the year, so it's great to get back, go out with my mates from other walks of life and do the things they do. You can't live, eat and breathe the sport all the time- it's not healthy. I'm known within the world of sailing, but fortunately I can count the number of times I've been recognised in the street on the fingers of one hand. I'd hate to become some sort of celebrity. I get a lot of nice letters from people wanting signed pictures, though. It may take ages, but I reply to every one. It would be cheeky to complain, even if it does take a bit of organising.

D Tomas (tennis player)
It's always a great thing to walk on court and feel that the crowd's behind you. At the last tournament, though, it all got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Despite that, I have to admit that I do still get quite a thrill out of being spotted by fans when I'm out shopping or something. It has its downside though. My last girlfriend didn't like it if I got too much attention from female fans. The thing is,tennis players have to travel quite a lot, and in the end that's why we split up, I guess. That was hard, but you've got to make sacrifices in any sport; you've got to be serious and professional. Actually, it doesn't really bother me too much. I'm content to concentrate on my game now and catch up on the other things in life once I've retired, because, after all, that comes pretty early in this sport.",B2,,"**Dedicated to their sports**

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.

**A Darius (runner)**
I always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I could play for a football team, but I chose running. My best time was when I ran for my country with the young team. I won a medal. But not many people saw it on TV. I wanted to get money for my training because it costs a lot. I train at home in winter. Then I go away for three weeks, often to Florida, before the running season starts. It is fun there. The training places are good and the nights out are fun too. But I must be good and say no to fun sometimes. If my friends ask me to go out before training, I say no. I want to go, but it is important to work hard. My big dream is to go to the next Olympics. That would be great.

**B Gabriel (surfer)**
Not many people surf, so I see the same people at all the competitions. Good surfers are very serious. The best waves come early in the morning, so you cannot go to bed late. I don't mind too much, but I like to sleep late. I usually cannot do that. But it is good because last year I won the big competition in my country. After I win, I always go out for a big night. If I win money, I go to a nice place. It was good to work hard because now I have a job on TV. I talk about surfing. Now some people know me.

**C Dieter (yacht racer)**
There are five men on our boat. We have a lot of fun. We like old ways and we always have a big party when we win. People say we are like children when we go out, but we don't want to be in the newspaper. Sometimes the newspaper people care more about our parties than our races. I am away from home for eight months every year. So it is nice to come home and see my other friends. We do normal things. You cannot only think about your sport. That is not good for you. People in sailing know me, but people in the street usually don't know me. I like that. I don't want to be famous. I get nice letters from people. They want a picture with my name. It takes time, but I answer every letter. I cannot say it is bad, even if it is a lot of work.

**D Tomas (tennis player)**
I like to walk on the tennis court and hear people cheer for me. At my last game, there were too many people around me. But I still like it when people see me in a shop. There are bad things too. My last girlfriend was not happy when girl fans talked to me. Also, tennis players travel a lot. I think that is why we are not together now. That was sad, but in sports you must give up some things. You must be serious. But I am okay. I am happy to think only about tennis now. I can do other things when I stop playing tennis. Tennis players stop when they are young.","**Dedicated to their sports**

I have always liked sports. I tried many different sports when I was younger, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I decided to focus on running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Sadly, not many people in the media talked about it. I was hoping to get some money from a sponsor because training is expensive. I train at home all winter, and then I go away for three weeks, usually to Florida, before the season starts. It's fun there because they have great places to train and the nightlife is good too. But you have to be very disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but working hard is important in this sport. My biggest dream is to go to the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

180,"Running a business in the countryside 

Five women talk about their experiences setting up a business in the countryside. 

A.
'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over PS200,000 a year and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small, and I wanted work I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I was married, so my husband suggested I set up a computer-aided design business. It needed a huge amount of money and things were difficult in the beginning. But I have been very careful, making sure that I told the bank manager if I was likely to overspend. Being in the house is a big saving, and I can carry on working in the evening if I want. It has remained a small business. We hardly ever deliver work - people from the area tend to collect it from us.' 

B.
'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who works from home as a designer of greetings cards. 'I trained in art at university, and wanted to work in a museum. But when I married, we went to live in the countryside, where there wasn't that sort of work. So I decided to set up my own business and I produce a range of 50 greetings cards which I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The disadvantage of working from home is that there is always something that needs doing - like mowing the lawn. My business comes completely by word of mouth - I don't advertise at all. People send work down from London as I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't get to exchange ideas with other people any more, but generally there are more advantages than disadvantages.' 

C.
'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, whose curtain-making business has seen good times and bad. 'I started my business eight years ago. Then this type of business was expanding, and in two years my turnover went from PS24,000 to PS80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to sack them because of the decline in the economy, which was painful because it is not easy to find other jobs in this area. I am right back almost to where I started, making the curtains at home myself, with my husband's help, and using women who work from their homes. I have to be prepared to cut my prices when it's necessary and to look at different opportunities.' 

D.
TESSA STRICKLAND runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. The first was financial, because London was so expensive, and the second was because I love the country. I enjoy being able to work when I want to. Eighty per cent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The disadvantage is that it requires discipline to shut the office door. I publish children's books from cultures around the world, working with authors and artists. All my professional experience had been in London, so I used to feel very alone at first.' 

E.
MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of PS250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes, using good quality flour and eggs. Then I started getting requests from friends and relatives, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago I rented a small building and everything is made there - we have a baker and assistant, and a professional cake-icer. I don't cook at all now, as I run the commercial side. My greatest problem has been the financial side of the business, which has been difficult simply because we didn't have an enormous amount of money to set up with.' ",B2,"A business in the country

The problem with working at home is there is always work to do in the house. People tell their friends about her cards. She does not put ads in the paper. People from London send her work because her price is good. She works alone. She does not talk to other people about her work. But she likes her job.

181,"So you want to be an actor

If you tell someone that you want to make a career as an actor, you can be sure that within two minutes the word 'risky' will come up. And, of course, acting is a very risky career - let there be no mistake about that. The supply of actors is far greater than the demand for them. 
Once you choose to become an actor, many people who you thought were your closest friends will tell you you're crazy, though some may react quite differently. No two people will give you the same advice. But it is a very personal choice you are making, and only you can take responsibility for yourself and for realising your ambition. 
There are no easy ways of getting there - no written examinations to pass, and no absolute guarantee that when you have successfully completed your training you will automatically make your way in the profession. It's all a matter of luck plus talent. Yet there is a demand for new faces and new talent, and there is always the prospect of excitement, glamour and the occasional rich reward. 
I have frequently been asked to define this magical thing called talent, which everyone is looking out for. I believe it is best described as natural skill plus imagination - the latter being the most difficult quality to assess. And it has a lot to do with the person's courage and their belief in what they are doing and the way they are putting it across. 
Where does the desire to act come from? It is often very difficult to put into words your own reasons for wanting to act. Certainly, in the theatre the significant thing is that moment of contact between the actor on the stage and a particular audience. And making this brief contact is central to all acting, wherever it takes place - it is what drives all actors to act. 
If you ask actors how they have done well in the profession, the response will most likely be a shrug. They will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job, and that their fame may not continue. 
Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. Last month you may have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly you are asked to audition for a part, but however much you want the job, the truth is that it may be denied you. So actors tend not to talk about their chances. They come up with ways of protecting themselves against the stress of competing for a part and the possibility of rejection. 
Nobody likes being rejected. And remember that the possibility is there from the very first moment you start going in for parts professionally. You are saying that you are available, willing and, hopefully, talented enough for the job. And, in many ways, it's up to you, for if you don't care enough, no-one will care for you. ",B2,,"So you want to be an actor

If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will say it is ""risky."" And yes, it is a risky job. There are more actors than jobs.

When you choose to be an actor, some friends may say you are crazy. Others may not. People will give you different ideas. But it is your choice. Only you can make your dream come true.

It is not easy to become an actor. There are no tests. Even after you learn, you may not find work. You need luck and talent. But people like new actors. You can find excitement, fame, and sometimes much money.

People ask what talent is. I think it is a natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to see. It also needs you to be brave and believe in your work.

Why do people want to act? It is hard to say. In the theatre, the special time is when the actor and the people watching feel something together. This feeling is why actors act.

If you ask actors why they do well, they often do not know. They know about their skills and other actors' skills. But they think success may not stay. They know they are only as good as their last job.

Disappointment is hard for actors. One month you have no work. You may sell clothes or work in a café. Then, you can try for a part. But you may not get it. So actors learn to feel okay when they try and fail.

No one likes to hear ""no."" This can happen from your first try for a job. You say you are free, you want to work, and you hope you are good enough. In the end, it is about you. If you do not try hard, no one will help you.","So you want to be an actor

If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is ""risky."" And it is true — acting is a very risky job. There are many more actors than jobs for them.

When you decide to become an actor, some friends may say you are crazy. Others may not. Everyone will give you different advice. But it is your choice, and only you can make your dream happen.

There are no easy ways to become an actor. You don't have to pass exams, and even after training, you may not find work. Success depends on luck and talent. But people always want new actors, and the job can be exciting, glamorous, and sometimes well-paid.

People often ask what talent is. I think it is a natural skill plus imagination. Imagination is the hardest part to judge. It also has a lot to do with courage and believing in what you are doing.

Why do people want to act? It is hard to explain. In the theatre, the important thing is the moment when the actor and the audience connect. This connection is what all actors want to feel.

If you ask actors why they are successful, they often don't know. They know about their own skills and other actors' skills. But they don't think success will last, because they know they are only as good as their last job.

Disappointment is the actor's biggest problem. One month you may have no work and do another job. Then you get an audition, but you may not get the part. So actors learn to protect themselves from the stress of trying and failing.

No one likes to be told ""no."" And from the first time you try for a part, this can happen. You are saying you are ready and able to do the job. In the end, it depends on you — if you don't try hard, no one will notice you.",,,
182,"The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying off to wonderful locations and appearing on the covers of magazines, you'll probably find her revising for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 

'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in an awful mood and refuse to answer my questions. 
But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic and with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. 
Kira gives the impression of being slightly puzzled by her new-found fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should take part in the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. 
The achievement of being selected for the final [line 38: beginning] gave Kira the confidence to go through with it and [line 38: end] she performed perfectly. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. 
Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become accustomed to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I have too high an opinion of myself.' This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.' 
As a busy model though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can ring at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modelling now, you never have time for us"".' 
Kira has the looks, ability and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.' ",B2,,"The Schoolgirl Model

When Kira Langer is 15 years old, she is a model. When she is not going to beautiful places and being on the front of magazines, she is studying for her school tests. Jane Laidlaw talks to her.

'Sorry, Kira will be a little late,' a woman at the model agency said to me. 'That's fine,' I said. I read some bad things about models. I thought they might not be nice people. Now Kira was late. How late? One hour? Maybe she would not come. What if she went to the hairdresser and did not want to talk to me? If she was late, she might be angry.

But then the girl arrived. She won a big model competition for Looks magazine. She was smiling and said sorry. Her mother was with her. Kira did not wear expensive clothes. She wore a simple black dress and trainers. She was not a selfish person. She was a friendly, tall, pretty girl. She said all models under 16 must have a grown-up with them for work. Her mother looked young and was very happy for her daughter.

Kira feels a little surprised about being famous. She did not plan it. Her older sister saw the model competition. Her sister said Kira should try it. 'I said no, but she sent my photos to them,' Kira said. Then someone called her at school. They said she was in the final.

Being in the final made Kira feel more sure. She did very well and won. A model agency in London gave her work after that.

The hardest thing for Kira is having two lives. She goes to school and she is a model. Her friends and teachers are okay with it now. 'They are happy for me,' she says. But some people at her school are not nice. 'They say I think I am better than them.' This is hard for Kira because she is not like that. She says, 'They think I am different now because I am a model. But I am the same. I just feel more sure of myself. I can say what I think more.'

Her modeling job changes her free time. The agency can call any time. They can tell her she has work the next day. 'If my friends want to go out, I cannot say yes. I do not know about tomorrow. I cannot make plans. Sometimes I make plans but then I have to stop them. My friends are good about it. They do not get angry.'

Kira is pretty, she can do the work, and people help her. She can have a great job in the future. Not many people can say that before they finish school. I am nearly finished talking to her. I ask her: What job would you like if you were not so pretty? She waits a moment, then says: 'I would like to do your job.'","The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to beautiful places and being on magazine covers, you will probably find her studying for school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more.

'I'm sorry, Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'That's fine,' I said. I had been thinking that all the bad things I read about models were not true, but the words difficult, proud and not clever kept coming into my head. And now she was late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she would not come at all. What if she decided that going to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be in a hurry. She could be in a bad mood and not answer my questions.

But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition came in, she was smiling, relaxed and said sorry. Her mother was with her. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. She did not seem selfish, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. She explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother looked very young, but she was a normal mum - you could see she was proud of her successful daughter.

Kira seems a little surprised by her new fame, which makes sense because it was not planned. Her older sister decided that Kira should enter the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should try it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos anyway.' When someone called to say she was a finalist, she was at school.

Being chosen for the final made Kira feel confident enough to do it, and she did very well. She won easily and the Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Now, one of the hardest things for Kira is managing her two different lives. But her friends and teachers are used to having a star with them. 'They are really proud of me,' she says. However, some unkind people at her school say bad things about her success. 'They say I think I am too important.' These words must be difficult for Kira because not many successful people are less proud than her. But she says, 'They think that because I suddenly became a model, I can't be the same person. But the only change is I feel more confident - not in a bad way, but I can speak up for myself more.'

As a busy model, her social life is clearly different. The Select agency can call at any time and tell her she has a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out, I can't say I will join them because I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes change. But my friends understand. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always modelling now, you never have time for us"".'

Kira has the looks, skill and support to have a great career in front of her. Not many people can say that before they finish school. I am nearly finished with the interview with the girl who has everything, and I ask what job she would like to do if she did not have the special beauty that will probably make her very successful. She stops for a moment and answers: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.'",,,

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. 

Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean we can't stand up or move and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.' 
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. No-one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures; including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. 
The Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' 
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"". This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.'
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a SO-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. 
There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real it was such an amazing feeling.' ",B2,,"In hot water

If there's one thing guaranteed to send tears running down your cheeks, it's the sight of a brilliant child collecting a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars, and their mothers, to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. 

A. 
Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. Her ambitions are to become a physiotherapist and compete at the next Olympics. 'The work is very hard at the moment. There is no time to watch television, or go out with friends or do much more than gym and school. I try to take the training day by day, and when I feel very, very tired sometimes my coach gives me a day off, but usually I just carry on - you can't take too many days off, it makes you stiff.' 

B.
Annika's mother

'From an early age Annika showed tremendous potential. I've seen some parents try to push their children and it doesn't work. To perform at the level Annika does is so demanding of time and energy you have to want to do it yourself. People tell me all the time that we, as parents, have given up so much, but what they don't see is what the sport's given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before she did gym she was a very shy little girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me, but now she's met people from all over the world and she's got the confidence of success.' 

C. 
Sarah Stokes made her first show-jumping appearance at ten. Since then 
she has won the British National Championship. 'It's a good job my mum and dad like show-jumping because they train me and have to take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows are from one day to five days long. I don't ever get tired of it - I love show-jumping events, they are exciting and fun. Even if I didn't have Mum and Dad, I would do it because I am so determined. I'm 
glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My really big ambition is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.' 

D. Sarah's mother

'From the moment Sarah sat on a horse, age 1, that was it, her passion. When she was 5, she used to get up before us all to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows you have to jump all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is well organised. She is 100% happy on a horse, she knows what she's doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is hard to beat.' 

E. Jane McShane, 10, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. 'It's really friendly at tournaments. I know everybody and it's fun. When I'm playing, I don't concentrate. I should do really, but instead I just stare around and don't bother to think. I'm not scared of getting big-headed, I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like embarrassment.' 

F. Jane's mother

'Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, ""Let's see if she likes it."" My father had tried to teach me when I was young and I used to sit there bored, but Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that afternoon she had memorised all the moves, and by 6 was starting to beat adults. When she's won of course I'm pleased, but if she said she wanted to give it all up tomorrow, I wouldn't stand in her way. On the other hand I don't want to do the awful thing of putting somebody down because they are exceptional. If she has this gift, let her fulfil her potential.' ",B2,"Tears and Smiles

Sometimes, a very good child gets a medal. This can make you cry. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars. She also talked to their mothers. They talked about the happy parts of their lives. They also talked about the hard parts.

Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics. She wants to be a physiotherapist. She wants to go to the next Olympics. ""My work is very hard now. I have no time for TV. I have no time for friends. I only do gym and school. I do one day at a time. Sometimes I am very, very tired. Then my coach gives me a day off. But I usually keep going. You cannot take many days off. Your body gets stiff.""

B. Annika's mother
""Annika was very good from a young age. Some parents push their children. That is not good. To be like Annika takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of work. You must want to do it. People say we, the parents, give up a lot. But they do not see what the sport gives us. We love the sport. We love what it does for Annika. Before gym, she was a shy little girl. She sucked her thumb. She hid behind me. Now she meets people from many countries. She is confident because she wins.""

C. Sarah Stokes
Sarah first did show-jumping at age ten. Now she is the British National Champion. ""It is good my mum and dad like show-jumping. They train me. They take me everywhere in our horse truck. The shows are one day to five days long. I never get tired of it. I love show-jumping. It is exciting and fun. Even without my mum and dad, I would do it. I really want to do it.

185,"Going up the wall

Once climbers went to the mountains. Now a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. 

The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. 
The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. 
Until the mid-1960s,climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. During the winter they would either tolerate the cold weather, go walking instead or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. 
However, as the sport developed it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. This allowed them to keep their fingers strong, and beat off the boredom of not being able to climb. It wasn't long before many sports centres started building walls specifically for the task, using bricks with special edges to cling on to.
Many of these early walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education who, during the mid-1960s,constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University. Robinson developed the idea of setting natural rock in a block of concrete, which could then be included in a wall. 
Scores of climbing walls of this kind were built in sports halls up and down the country throughout the 1970s but they had obvious design problems. Walls could only be built in a vertical plane, whereas cliffs outside have features like overhangs and angled slabs of rock. There was the added drawback that once the walls were up they couldn't be altered and climbers would eventually tire of their repetitive nature, despite thinking of every combination of holds possible. 
In 1985,a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, developed a material which he moulded into shapes like those that climbers would find on the cliffs. These could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination. 
French manufacturers also began to experiment with panels on a steel framework. Concrete had proved too heavy to create overhanging walls without major building work, but steel frames could be erected anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers an endless supply of new holds. ",B2,,"Climbing Up Walls

In the past, climbers went to the mountains. Now, you can find a difficult climb anywhere, inside or outside.

The people watching are very quiet. High up on the climbing wall, a French climber named Francois Lombard is hanging upside down, holding on with only two fingers. He is in the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham.

This place is also known for a TV show called Gladiators. The TV show and the climbing competition both use the same thing: The Wall. This is possible because of new technology.

Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on real cliffs. In the winter, they had to climb in the cold, go for walks, or climb on ice in Scotland.

But climbers needed to stay strong. When they couldn't use the cliffs, they practiced on the edges of brick or stone buildings. This made their fingers strong and stopped them from being bored. Soon, sports centres started building special walls with bricks that had edges to hold.

A teacher named Don Robinson made one of the first climbing walls at a university in the 1960s. He put real rock into concrete blocks and used them to build a wall.

Many walls like this were built in the 1970s, but they had problems. The walls were only straight up and down, but real cliffs have different shapes. Also, the walls could not be changed, so climbers got bored.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material. He shaped it like the holds on real cliffs. These shapes could be fixed to any wall and moved around when climbers wanted a change.

French companies also started making walls with steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for walls that lean out, but steel frames could be built anywhere. With parts that can be changed, climbers always have new holds to try.","Climbing up the wall

The National Indoor Arena is famous for the TV show Gladiators, but the TV show and the climbing competition both have one thing in common - The Wall. Both events are possible because of new technology that is changing quickly.

Before the 1960s, climbers practised on cliffs in places with many good rocks to climb. In winter, they either climbed in the cold, went for walks, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland.

But as climbing became more popular, it was important for the best climbers to stay strong. When they couldn't use the cliffs, they practised on brick walls or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and stopped them from getting bored. Soon, many sports centres began building special walls for climbing, using bricks with special edges to hold onto.

Many of the first walls were like the one built by Don Robinson, a sports teacher. In the mid-1960s, he built a climbing wall in a hallway at Leeds University. Robinson's idea was to put real rocks into concrete blocks, which could then be used to build a wall.

Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls across the country in the 1970s, but they had problems. These walls could only be straight up and down, while real cliffs have parts that stick out or are at an angle. Another problem was that once the walls were built, they couldn't be changed. Climbers would get bored with the same holds, even if they tried every way to use them.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material. He shaped it to look like the holds climbers find on real cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new.

French companies also started testing walls made with panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy to make walls that stick out, but steel frames could be built anywhere as separate structures. With parts that could be changed, climbers always had new holds to try.",,,
186,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees from the woods were turned into boards for construction work, there was an old brick building two floors high, and all around the outside walls were heaped great piles of soft sawdust. There were many of these golden mountains of dust covering that part of the yard right down to the blue lake. That afternoon, bored with having nothing else to do, all the fellows followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building and they sat with their legs hanging over the edge looking out across the lake. Suddenly Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and without thinking about it, he pushed himself off the roof and fell on the sawdust where he lay rolling around and laughing. 'I dare you all!' he shouted. 'You're all cowards,' he said, encouraging them to follow him. Still laughing, he watched them looking down from the roof, white-faced and hesitant, and then one by one they jumped and got up grinning with relief. 
In the hot afternoon sunlight they all lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes till at last one of the fellows said, 'Come on up on the old roof again and jump down.'There wasn't much enthusiasm among them, but they all went up to the roof again and began to jump off in a determimed desperate way till only Michael was left and the others were all down below grinning up at him calling, 'Come on, Mike. What's the matter with you?' Michael wanted to jump down there and be with them, but he remained on the edge of the roof, wetting his lips, with a silly grin on his face, wondering why it had not seemed such a long drop the first time. For a while they thought he was only fooling them, but then they saw him clenching his fists tight. He was trying to count to ten and then jump, and when that failed, he tried to take a long breath and close his eyes. In a while the fellows began to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting and it was getting on to dinnertime. 'Come on, you're a coward, do you think we're going to sit here all night?' they began to shout, and when he did not move they began to get up and walk away, still shouting. 'Who did this in the first place? What's the matter with you all?' he called. 
But for a long time he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily and steadily at the ground. He remained all alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a great orange ball getting bigger and bigger, rolled slowly over the grey line beyond the lake. His clothes , were wet from nervous sweating. At last he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the pile of sawdust and lay there a long time. There were no sounds in the yard, the workmen had gone home. As he lay there he wondered why he had been unable to jump and then he got up slowly and walked home feeling deeply ashamed and wanting to avoid everybody. 
He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said to him coldly, 'You're big enough by this time surely to be able to get home in time for dinner. But if you won't come home, you'd better try staying in tonight.' She was a well-built woman with a fair, soft skin and a little touch of grey in her hair and an eternally patient smile on her face. She was speaking now with a controlled severity, but Michael, with his dark face gloomy and miserable, hardly heard her; he was still seeing the row of grinning faces down below on the sawdust pile and hearing them laugh at him. ",B2,"At the lake, there is a place with wood. There is an old building. Outside, there are big piles of soft sawdust. The sawdust is like yellow hills. It goes to the blue lake.

One day, the boys are bored. They go with Michael up to the roof. They sit and look at the lake.

Michael says, ""Jump!"" He jumps off the roof. He falls on the sawdust. He laughs. ""You jump too!"" he says. ""You are all scared!""

The boys on the roof look down. They are scared. Then, one by one, they jump. They get up and smile. They are happy.

They all sit on the sawdust. They tell jokes. Then one boy says, ""Let's go to the roof and jump again.""

They are not happy, but they go up. They jump off the roof. Soon, only Michael is on the roof. The other boys are on the ground. They smile at him. ""Come, Mike! What is wrong?"" they say.

Michael wants to jump. He wants to be with his friends. But he stands on the roof. He is scared. The first time was easy. Now it is hard.

His friends wait. They think he is playing. Then they see his hands. They are tight. He tries to count to ten and jump. He tries to close his eyes. It does not work.

His friends laugh. They are tired of waiting. It is time for dinner. ""Come! You are scared! We cannot wait!"" they say. When he does not move, they go away. They are still talking.

""Who started this? What is wrong?"" Michael says.

But he stays on the roof for a long time. He is alone. He looks at the ground. He is not happy. The sun is big and orange. It goes down. Michael's clothes are wet. He is very nervous.

At last, he closes his eyes. He falls off the roof. He lands on the sawdust. He lies there for a long time. The place is quiet. The workers are gone.

He lies there and thinks. Why was it hard to jump? He gets up slowly. He walks home. He feels very bad. He does not want to see people.

He is late for dinner. His stepmother is not happy. She says, ""You are big. You must come home for dinner. If you are late, you must stay home.""

She is a big woman. She has light skin. She has some grey hair. She is usually happy. Now she is not happy. She talks in a serious way.

But Michael is sad. He does not hear her well. He still sees his friends' faces. He still hears them laugh.","At the place by the lake where trees are cut into wood for building, there was an old two-floor brick building. Outside, there were big piles of soft yellow sawdust. The sawdust covered the ground all the way to the blue lake. That afternoon, the boys had nothing to do. They followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs over the side and looked at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof. He landed on the sawdust and rolled around, laughing. ""I dare all of you!"" he shouted. ""You are all afraid,"" he said, telling them to jump too. He laughed as he watched them look down from the roof. They looked scared and did not want to jump. Then, one by one, they jumped. They stood up and smiled because they were okay.

In the hot sun, they all lay on the sawdust and told jokes. Then one boy said, ""Let's go back to the roof and jump again."" They didn't really want to, but they all went up. They started to jump off the roof, one after another. Soon, only Michael was on the roof. The others were on the ground, looking up at him. ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" they called. Michael wanted to jump and be with them, but he stood on the edge of the roof. He licked his lips and had a strange smile. He did not understand why the jump looked so high now. At first, his friends thought he was joking. Then they saw him make his hands into tight fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but he couldn't. He tried to take a deep breath and close his eyes. After a while, the boys started to laugh at him. They were tired of waiting. It was almost time for dinner. ""Come on, you are afraid! Do you think we will wait all night?"" they shouted. When he did not move, they got up and walked away, still shouting. ""Who started this? What is wrong with all of you?"" he called.

But he stayed on the edge of the roof for a long time. He looked sadly at the ground. He was alone for almost an hour. The sun was like a big orange ball getting lower in the sky. His clothes were wet because he was so nervous. Finally, he closed his eyes, slid off the roof, and fell hard on the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet. The workers had gone home. As he lay there, he thought about why he could not jump. Then he got up slowly and walked home. He felt very embarrassed and did not want to see anyone.

He was very late for dinner. His stepmother said to him in a cold voice, ""You are big enough to come home for dinner on time. If you won't come home, you should stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with light skin and a little grey in her hair. She always had a patient smile, but now she spoke in a serious way. Michael was sad and upset. He did not really hear her. He could still see the boys' smiling faces on the sawdust pile and hear them laughing at him.","At the lumberyard by the lake, where wood from the forest was cut into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust against the walls. There were many of these golden hills of dust, going all the way down to the blue lake.

That afternoon, the boys were bored. They followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs over the side, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump."" Without thinking, he pushed himself off the roof. He landed on the sawdust, rolled around, and laughed. ""I dare all of you!"" he shouted. ""You are all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to jump. He laughed as he watched them look down from the roof. They looked scared and unsure, but then one by one, they jumped. They stood up, smiling with relief.

In the hot afternoon sun, they all lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes. Finally, one boy said, ""Let's go back up on the roof and jump again."" They didn't really want to, but they all went up and started to jump in a serious way. Soon, only Michael was left on the roof. The others were below, smiling up at him and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?""

Michael wanted to jump down and be with them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof. He licked his lips and had a silly smile on his face. He wondered why the drop didn't seem so high the first time.

187,"Keeping the holiday-makers happy

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. 

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. 
Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' 
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. 
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. 
Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' 
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. 
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' 
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. ",B2,"Sarah works in France. She is a chalet girl. She makes beds and cooks food for visitors. The visitors come to ski. They stay in wooden houses called chalets.

Sarah is 24 years old. This is her second year doing this job. She says it is not a job for life. It is a fun way to spend one or two years.

She does not live in the chalet. She walks to work at 7 in the morning. She makes breakfast for the guests. The guests eat eggs, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans the rooms. She says this is the worst part of her job.

At 11 in the morning, she goes skiing. She skis until the afternoon. Then she goes back to the chalet to make dinner. She does not sleep first.

Dinner has three parts. She serves it at 8 in the evening. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. Sometimes she talks with the guests. Sometimes the guests like to be alone.

In the evening, she meets her friends. They go out at 11. But she never stays out very late on Saturday. Sunday is a very busy day.

On Sunday, she starts work early. The guests leave, and she cleans everything. Then new guests come in the afternoon. She makes tea for them. Sometimes the new guests have many questions.

After tea, she helps guests get skis. Then she goes back to the chalet to make dinner. Sometimes she is very tired and goes to bed early.","Making holiday guests happy

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch works as a chalet girl. She tells us about her job while she makes beds and cooks nice dinners.

Sarah is 24 years old and from West Sussex. This is her second year working in a chalet. Her nickname is Pilch. She works for a company in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski. They stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah finished university last summer. She studied French and Art History.

Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a long-term job. It is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a different life. ""It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah does not live at the chalet where she works. She gets up at 7 a.m. and walks about one mile to the chalet. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her own breakfast first. Then she makes breakfast for the guests. They get a lot of food - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.

When the last guest finishes breakfast at about 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans the kitchen. Then she makes afternoon tea for the guests to eat later, or she cleans the rooms. She says cleaning the rooms is the worst part of her job.

By about 11 a.m., she is ready to go skiing. She skis as much as she can. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says. Sarah goes back to the chalet to make dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep. ""It's a bad idea if you sleep,"" she says.

Dinner has three parts and is served at 8 p.m. Coffee is ready by 10 p.m. Sarah cleans the dinner things and uses the dishwasher. ""It is very bad to see a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she says. Sometimes she talks with the guests. Other times, the guests like to be alone. ""Nice guests can make the week wonderful. But some weeks are not so good,"" she says.

Sarah meets her friends at the house where she lives. They go out at about 11 p.m. ""We often go to Bananas first, then maybe to G Jay's, and sometimes to Dick's T-Bar at the end of the night,"" she says. But Sarah never stays out very late on Saturday. Sunday is her busiest day. ""It is a terrible day,"" she says. ""You do not want to cook breakfast with a bad headache.""

On Sunday, work starts earlier than other days. Breakfast for guests who are leaving must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans everything very fast. ""We clean the whole place - we clear the breakfast, take the sheets off the beds, and get everything ready,"" she says. If she did not buy the food for the week on Saturday, she does it on Sunday.

At about 3 p.m., when the cleaning is finished, Sarah makes tea for the new guests. They arrive at about 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and ask many questions. ""I think the mountain air makes them feel this way,"" Sarah says.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop. Then someone from the shop drives her back to the chalet. Soon it is time to make dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink later, but not always. ""Sometimes I am so tired that I just go to bed early,"" she says.","Making holiday guests happy

188,"Conduct becoming 

Giving directions to an orchestra is never easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work. 

A. ANNE MANSON 

When Anne Manson, 30, asked if she could attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna, she found herself standing in for an absent assistant. She was then asked to help on another opera the next season. 'I had to take the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I always had a good attitude to standing up in front of an orchestra.' American-born Manson works with a well established London-based opera company which concentrates on modern works. She is also building a reputation in other European countries, which she has visited with financial aid from the British Arts Council, and, since that first occasion, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects. 

B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE 

The most difficult part of being a conductor is deciding how to convince people to present you with the right opportunities; saysAndrew Constantine, 31, who won a major competition in 1991, after failed attempts in two other contests. Looking back, he is grateful for the timing: 'If it had happened any earlier, I am sure I would have disappeared without trace: The competition provided many performance opportunities and a period as assistant to a well-known conductor, but Constantine is finding it difficult to lose the 'competition' label: 'If in three years' time my name is still associated with the competition then I will be worried,' he says.'But orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra who took me on after the competition are now inviting me back. If this doesn't happen,your career will gradually fall to pieces.' 

C. WASFI KANI 

Wasfi Kani, who set up Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice period which is part of any opera production. 'The music is worth four weeks' attention; says Kani, who started conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she supported herself by working in London's commercial centre until Pimlico Opera turned fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons 
with Sian Edwards was the key moment for her. 'I saw her conduct and realised she was the same size as me - I had always been taught by much bigger people which makes a huge difference.' She likes the complicated nature of opera: 'There are lots of arguments, and you've got singers' personalities to consider ... ' 

D. ROGER VIGNOLES 

'Conducting has come upon me as something of a surprise, but it holds great fascination for me,' says Roger Vignoles, 48. In fact, it's not such a strange career move. He started out as a resident musician with an opera house, and worked with good conductors. Last year he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. 'It was much less difficult than I thought. I found I knew the music well, I knew what I wanted it to sound like, and I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. Fortunately, people have respected my ability as a musician generally. I am benefiting from every piece of experience I've ever had, both in musical style and in the actual business of performing. Now I will do whatever people ask me to do so I can find out what I like doing.' 

E. WAYNE MARSHALL 

It was back in 1986 that the conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor on one of his productions and told his agent about Wayne Marshall. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, a difficult beginning. He even had to deal with some over-relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: 'I was just tough with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. A lot of orchestral musicians I've seen don't seem to need advice and instruction from a conductor. But I'm never afraid to say what I want. If people see you're worried, it gets worse. I've never studied conducting formally and no book tells you how to conduct but people have been kind to me. I am determined and I know what I like.' 
",B2,,,"**Conducting**

Leading an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis speaks with five new conductors about their jobs.

**A. Anne Manson**

When Anne Manson, who is 30, asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice in Vienna, she had to help because his assistant was not there. The next season, she was asked to help with another opera. 'I had to lead the first practice for Abbado. I was not nervous. I have always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra.' Manson is American and works with a famous London opera company that performs modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries. She has visited them with money from the British Arts Council. Since that first time, she has helped Abbado on several more projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**

'The hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right chances to work,' says Andrew Constantine, who is 31. He won an important competition in 1991 after not winning two others. He is happy he won when he did. 'If I had won earlier, I think I would not be successful now.' The competition gave him many chances to perform and to be an assistant to a famous conductor. But Constantine finds it hard that people still remember him for the competition. 'If people still connect my name to the competition in three years, I will be worried,' he says. 'But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are now asking me to come back. If this stops happening, your career will fail.'

**C. Wasfi Kani**

Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She loves the long practice time that is part of making an opera. 'The music is good, so it is worth four weeks of work,' says Kani. She began conducting seriously when she was almost 30. After university, she worked in London's business area to make money. Pimlico Opera became a full professional company two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was very important for her. 'I watched her conduct and saw she was the same size as me. My other teachers were much bigger, and that is very different.' She likes that opera is complicated. 'There are many disagreements, and you must think about the singers' personalities...'

**D. Roger Vignoles**

'Conducting was a surprise for me, but I find it very interesting,' says Roger Vignoles, who is 48. Actually, it is not a strange change for him. He first worked as a musician for an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to lead a performance of Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival. He had never done that before. 'It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well, I knew how I wanted it to sound, and I tried hard to get the performance I wanted. Luckily, people respect my skills as a musician. All my past experience helps me, both with musical style and with performing. Now I will try anything people ask me to do, so I can learn what I enjoy.'

**E. Wayne Marshall**

In 1986, the conductor Simon Rattle saw a young assistant conductor on one of his shows. He told his agent about Wayne Marshall. Marshall, now 32, soon had to conduct a musical in London with very little time to prepare. It was a difficult start. Some of the professional musicians were not paying attention and even read newspapers during the show. 'I was just strong with them. I always gave a clear beat and tried to get the best result. Many orchestra musicians don't seem to need help from a conductor. But I am never afraid to say what I want. If people see you are worried, it becomes worse. I never studied conducting in school, and no book tells you how to do it, but people have been nice to me. I know what I want, and I am determined.'",,,
189,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page. Yet very few call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. 
Rarely, if ever, are these pictures in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where, to quote the code of practice, 'there is a reasonable expectation of privacy', she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. 
That the PCC did not launch an investigation itself is a scandal. It should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the famous actress, has held back from making a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC [line 25: beginning] take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks? [line 25: end]
To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by their rivals and broadcast on TV and radio. The public would not be sympathetic and editors would have to refuse to publish such material. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. 
If the PCC decided to take on this role of 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage him or her to make a complaint? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless? In addition, celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up, and then be outraged to find it wasn't. Above all, the role itself is too enormous. How could the PCC realistically monitor the whole of the British press: national, regional and magazines? 
Then there is the embarrassment factor to consider. However seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they really want the further embarrassment of an investigation? I suspect the majority simply want to put it behind them and get on with their lives. Of course, one or two may have other reasons for keeping quiet. A worse story may exist, that they have managed to keep from the press, and they realise that this may also become public knowledge if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. 
One British comedian also suffered at the hands of the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again victims of a sneak photographer during a family holiday. His reason for this was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'fury', saying that they thought it was just a bit of fun, and that, being a film star who made comedies, they thought he had a sense of humour. This fear is understandable. People believe they will again become targets if they dare to challenge the tabloids. It is hard to see an easy solution to this serious problem. ",B2,"Every week, British newspapers show photos of famous people. The photos are private. This is not right.

Sometimes, pop stars let people take their photos. But often, they do not. The photos show private moments. This is bad for the famous people.

There is a group called the PCC. It helps with these bad photos. But not many people ask the PCC for help.

Are these photos good for people? No. They do not help stop crime. They do not keep people safe.

One famous actress was in a hotel. A hotel is a private place. But a newspaper showed her photo. She did not ask the PCC for help.

The PCC should look at these bad photos. It should also look at a story about a pop star's love life. The pop star did not ask for help. Should the PCC help anyway?

This is a good idea. Then, newspapers would stop showing bad photos. People would not like the newspapers. Photographers would not take these photos.

But there are problems. How would the PCC know which photos to look at? Should it ask the famous person? What if the famous person says no?

Also, the job is too big. There are many newspapers and magazines.

Another problem: famous people may feel bad. They may not want more people to talk about them. They want to forget about it.

Sometimes, they are scared. If they complain, the newspaper may write more bad stories. They think the newspaper will not stop.

One famous funny man was on holiday. A newspaper took photos of him and his family. He did not complain. He was scared the newspaper would write more about him.

People are scared to say no to the newspapers. This is a big problem. It is not easy to fix.",,"Every week, British newspapers show photos that go into people's private lives and break the rules for newspapers. Sometimes pop stars agree to have their photo taken, but this is not common. Usually, famous people feel very hurt when they see their private moments on the front page of a newspaper. But very few of them ask the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) for help. This organisation was created to deal with these problems.

These photos are almost never important for the public to see. Do private photos of pop stars help stop crime? How does a photo of a famous actress on a hotel balcony keep people safe? The actress has complained before about photographers taking pictures from far away. Since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain. But she did nothing.

It is wrong that the PCC did not start an investigation itself. It should also look into the recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these shameful stories?

At first, this seems like a very good idea. It would probably lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers and TV stations would report these decisions. The public would not support the newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected. They would not be able to make money by spending days waiting to take photos of famous people without them knowing.

If the PCC decided to act like a police officer, which it could, there would be some problems. How would it choose when to start an inquiry? Should it contact the victim and ask them to complain? And if the person still refused to do anything, should the PCC continue? Also, famous people and royalty might expect the PCC to investigate every story about them, and then be angry when it doesn't. Most importantly, the job is too big. How could the PCC watch all British newspapers and magazines?

We also need to think about embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy has been seriously invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? I think most people just want to forget about it and continue with their lives. Of course, some may have other reasons to stay quiet. They might be hiding a worse story from the press and worry that if they complain, this story could also become public. So, even the PCC might seem like an enemy.

A British comedian also had problems with the press. He and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He didn't complain then, or later when his family was photographed on holiday. He was afraid the newspaper would show the photos again with a new story about his anger. The newspaper might say they thought it was just fun and that, because he makes comedies, he should have a sense of humour. This fear makes sense. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the newspapers. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem.",,,

Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had only just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact, nobody to tell you that their bedsit would be vacant at the end of the month. No, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching.
For Jo, Dublin was a very big blank spot. She really felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go. Who would stay in a one-horse town, the back of beyond, the end of the world, the sticks? That's all she had heard for years. They were all going to get out, escape, see some life, get some living in, have a real kind of existence, and some of the others in her class had gone as far as the towns of Ennis or Limerick, where an elder sister or an aunt would see them settled in. But out of Jo's year, none of them were going to Dublin. She was heading off on her own.
Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel. It was run by nuns, and she would come to no harm. Her father said that he hoped they kept the place warm; hostels were well known for being freezing. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel as waitresses, said she must be off her head to have stayed a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking about her and discussing her, as she answered the advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too dear!
There wasn't a queue for this one because it wasn't so much 'Flat to Let', more 'Third Girl Wanted'. The fact that it said 'own television' made Jo wonder whether it might be too high a class for her, but the house did not look in any way overpowering. An ordinary red-brick terraced house with a basement. But the flat was not in the basement, it was upstairs. And a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and went on climbing.
'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' printed on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that toffee-nosed girl going out? I can't stand that kind, I can't stand them.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just poked around and pulled a face and sort of giggled and then said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her in here, would we, Pauline?'
Pauline had a psychedelic shirt on, so colourful it almost hurt the eyes, but even so it was only slightly brighter than her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with amazement. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I rang.' Nessa said they were just about to have a mug of tea. She produced three mugs; one had 'Nessa' and one had 'Pauline' and the other one had 'Other' written on it. 'We'll get your name put on if you come to stay,' she said generously.",B2,"It is hard to find a good flat in Dublin. It is hard to find one that is not too expensive. The best way is to know someone. If you know a person who is leaving their flat, you can take it. But Jo is new in Dublin. She does not know anyone. So she must stay in a hostel and look for a flat.

Dublin is a big, new city for Jo. She feels it is a new place for her. She does not ask why she is going. Her friends from school all said they would leave their small town. They wanted to see a big city and have a new life. Some of her friends went to other towns. But Jo is the only one going to Dublin. She is going alone.

Jo's mother likes the hostel. It is run by nuns. She thinks Jo will be safe there. Her father hopes the hostel is warm. He thinks hostels can be cold. Jo's sisters work in a hotel. They think Jo is silly to stay in a hostel for a week. But Jo does not know they are talking about her. She sees an ad for a flat. The ad says: ""Your own room. Your own TV. Share a kitchen and bathroom."" The flat is near her work at the post office. It sounds very good. Jo hopes the flat is nice. She hopes the people like her. She hopes it is not too expensive.

There is no line of people for this flat. The ad is for a ""third girl"" to live with two others. The ad says ""own TV"". Jo thinks the flat might be too nice for her. But the house looks normal. It is a red house. The flat is not in the basement. It is upstairs. A girl with a college scarf is coming down the stairs. She says, ""It is a bad place. The girls are not nice."" Jo says, ""Oh,"" and goes up the stairs.

A girl with ""Nessa"" on her shirt says hello. She says, ""Did you see that girl? I do not like her."" Jo asks, ""What did she do?"" Nessa says, ""She looked around and made a face. She laughed and said the flat was not good. We did not want her to live here. Right, Pauline?""

Pauline has a very bright shirt and bright hair. Jo sees that Pauline is a punk. Jo has seen punks on the street but has not talked to one. Jo says, ""I am Jo. I work at the post office. I called you."" Nessa says they are having tea. She has three mugs. One says ""Nessa"". One says ""Pauline"". One says ""Other"". Nessa says, ""If you live here, we will put your name on a mug.""",,"Finding a good flat in Dublin that you could afford was like finding gold in the old days. The best way was through friends: if you knew someone who knew someone who was moving out, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no friends to help. No one could tell you that their room would be free at the end of the month. So, she had to stay in a hostel and look for a place.

For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown. She felt she was going into the unknown when she took the train to work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going. Everyone she knew at school said they would leave their small town. Who would stay in such a quiet place? That's all she heard for years. They all wanted to leave, to see more of life, to live in a real way. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where a sister or aunt helped them. But no one from Jo's year was going to Dublin. She was going alone.

Jo's mother thought it was good if she stayed in the hostel. It was run by nuns, and she would be safe. Her father said he hoped the hostel was warm; he had heard hostels were often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, said she was crazy to stay a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were still talking about her. She was answering an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own TV, share kitchen and bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed perfect. Please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too expensive!

There was no line of people for this flat because it wasn't exactly 'Flat to Rent'—it was more like 'Third Girl Wanted'. The words 'own television' made Jo think it might be too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was an ordinary red-brick house with a basement. But the flat was upstairs. A cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, who had clearly not been chosen, was coming down the stairs. 'Terrible place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Very common.' 'Oh,' said Jo, and kept going up.

'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can't stand people like that.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't need to do anything. She just looked around and made a face and laughed a little and said, ""Is this all? Oh dear,"" in a fancy voice. We wouldn't want her here, would we, Pauline?'

Pauline wore a very colourful shirt, so bright it almost hurt your eyes, but it was only a little brighter than her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo saw with surprise. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called.' Nessa said they were just about to have a cup of tea. She brought out three mugs; one said 'Nessa', one said 'Pauline', and the other said 'Other'. 'We'll put your name on one if you come to live here,' she said kindly.",,,
191,"The Collectors 

Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and the reasons why so many people enjoy the same hobby.
 
I have always loved collecting and collectors and one in three adults indulges in this hobby. It is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm and delight. However, if you enter this world, remember one thing: in the end, if you do not fall in love with an object, do not collect it. 
Since the beginning of time, people have had the urge to collect. When primitive man collected pebbles, he hung them around his neck. Attracted by their shapes and colour, these pebbles represented man's first attempts to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the intervening centuries, nothing much has changed. Small boys and girls still collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. 
I have been collecting all my life. Everything from flowers such as tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was of stones picked up in my parents' garden. Aged six I had the good fortune, although it did not seem so at the time, to be sent to a school in a remote part of England, a cold and windy place surrounded by hills. When my parents came to visit me they used to take me to the local museum, which was full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. 
Surprisingly I am not alone in being interested in collecting objects. One in three adults indulges the same passion. The reasons why people collect has become a subject of great interest. The current thinking is that, for some individuals, it is the only aspect of their lives where they have complete control. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing.
One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a 'room of wonders'. This was a collection of natural and artificial curiosities. There were cups made from coconut shells, carved ivory beads and pieces of Oriental china. Another aristocrat, Catherine the Great of Russia, collected more than 4,000 paintings.
However, you do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. I have collected items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups, searching out examples of each type with incredible determination. I remember the day that I persuaded a fellow collector of tulips to part with one which I wanted to add to my collection. I planted it and watered it until one year it vanished - stolen by another collector. 
One collection that I made was of American rag dolls - 350 of them. I looked all over the USA for these dolls, searching out each variation in design with delight. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. Next morning, I stood inside the front hall and saw the remains of furniture and my collection. I am not certain which saddened me more!
It is, I suppose, the way that collections change hands that has always interested me. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king, a poet: it is this that gives value to the goods that are traded in the markets of the world. As small objects become a popular collector's item, so they begin to rise in price. The toys of the 1950s are now positively an investment, provided of course, that you did not throw away the original boxes. (Not only did I put them in the bin, I also did the same to the contents.) ",B2,,"The Collectors

Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and why many people like this hobby.

I have always loved collecting things. One in three adults also enjoys this hobby. It is a world of strong feelings and fun. But if you start collecting, remember one thing: only collect things you really love.

For a very long time, people have wanted to collect things. Early people collected small stones and wore them. They liked the shapes and colours. These stones were some of the first things people collected. Today, many things are the same. Boys and girls still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.

I have collected things all my life. I have collected flowers like tulips, pots, and pictures. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school far away in England. It was a cold and windy place near hills. When my parents visited, they took me to the local museum. The museum had many old things that people collected. I loved looking at them.

I am not the only one who likes collecting. One in three adults loves it too. People want to know why we collect. Some experts think that for some people, it is the only part of their life they can control. For me, I just like doing it.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a 'room of wonders'. It had many interesting things from nature and things people made. There were cups from coconut shells, beads from ivory, and beautiful plates from the East. Another famous collector was Catherine the Great of Russia. She collected more than 4,000 paintings.

But you do not need to be rich or important to start a collection. I have collected many different things, like tulip bulbs and cups. I looked for them with a lot of energy. I remember one day I asked another tulip collector for one of his tulips for my collection. I planted it and gave it water. But one year, it was gone. Another collector took it.

I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I looked for them all over the USA. I was happy to find each different doll. But my house had a fire, and the collection was destroyed. The next morning, I stood in my house and saw the broken furniture and my dolls. I was very sad about both.

I think it is interesting how collections move from one person to another. A silver spoon that was once a king's or a poet's is special. This makes things valuable in markets around the world. When small things become popular to collect, their price goes up. Toys from the 1950s are now a good way to make money, but only if you kept the original boxes. I did not keep the boxes. I threw them and the toys away.","The Collectors

Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and why so many people enjoy this hobby.

I have always loved collecting things and meeting other collectors. One in three adults enjoys this hobby. It is a world full of passion, excitement, and happiness. But if you decide to start collecting, remember one important rule: only collect something if you truly love it.

People have always had the desire to collect things. In ancient times, early humans collected small stones and wore them as necklaces. They were attracted by the stones’ shapes and colours. These stones were among the first objects people collected for personal enjoyment or meaning. Over the centuries, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells today because they find them beautiful.

I have been collecting things my whole life. I have collected flowers like tulips, as well as pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents’ garden. When I was six, I was sent to a school in a remote part of England. It was a cold and windy place, surrounded by hills. At the time, I didn’t enjoy it. But when my parents visited, they took me to the local museum. It was filled with objects that people had collected in the past, and I found them fascinating.

I am not the only one interested in collecting. One in three adults shares this hobby. Experts are very interested in why people collect things. Some believe that for certain people, collecting is the only part of their life where they feel in complete control. For me, it is simply something I enjoy doing.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a “room of wonders” filled with natural and man-made curiosities. It contained cups made from coconut shells, carved ivory beads, and pieces of Oriental china. Another well-known collector was Catherine the Great of Russia, who collected more than 4,000 paintings.

However, you don’t need to be rich or powerful to start a collection. I have collected many different things, such as tulip bulbs and china cups. I searched for each type with great determination.

The next morning, I stood in the hall and saw the remains of my furniture and my dolls. I am not sure which made me more upset.

What has always interested me is how collections change owners. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet becomes more valuable. When small items become popular among collectors, their price increases. Toys from the 1950s are now a good investment—but only if you kept the original boxes. I did not.

192,"It's a tough job? 

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they're as wonderful as they seem. 

A. Raquel Graham 

Raquel Graham rings from the taxi taking her to the airport. She can't make our appointment tomorrow because her boss wants her to be in Los Angeles instead. When you're personal assistant to a pop star, you're expected to jet around the world at the drop of a hat. Raquel loves her job and gets on well with her boss. 
There's just one minor problem - she can't stand flying. 'On a nine-hour trip to California I usually take sleeping tablets to help calm me down,' she admits. Her worst experience was being on Concorde. 'It seemed so shut in with those tiny windows.' 
Offices in Manchester and London occupy her when she comes down to earth. There's some mundane paperwork to get through - organising the diary, sitting in on meetings with solicitors and accountants, sorting out itineraries and making yet more travel arrangements. 
She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with the manager of a pop group led to the offer of work behind the scenes and she took a secretarial certificate at evening classes at the same time. Five years later she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. 

B. David Brown 

David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy; a man who carries a golfer's bags. On the whole, he preferred the golf. Well, so would you if golf was your passion. There were drawbacks however. A small flat fee is on offer, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between PS25,000 and PS35,000 and much of that will go on travel and hotels. 
He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're offering advice, pitting your knowledge against the elements and trying to read the course.' 
His accountancy skills were recently recognised by European Tour Productions when they made him statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyses the statistics of each day's play. The results are sought after by television commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. 

C. Martin Fern 

Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper and one of his less difficult tasks is to sample what's on offer in the finest restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge exorbitant prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's up to them,' he says. 'I'd rather spend PS120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' 
It was his talent as a cook that led to the offer of a food column from a friend who happened to edit a Saturday Review. For Martin, at the time creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful secondary income. He was 42 when another newspaper rang to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50 per cent cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to convert my passion into a profession.' 
He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. 

D. Dick Prince 

'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I had always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing had mainly been verse. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer, and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. 
So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' 
Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbling - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. 
I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.' ",B2,,"Is it a hard job?

Chris Arnot asks four people with very good jobs if they are as nice as they seem.

A. Raquel Graham

Raquel Graham calls from a taxi. She is going to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss wants her to go to Los Angeles. When you work for a pop star, you must fly to many countries very fast. Raquel loves her job and she likes her boss. There is one small problem - she is afraid of flying. ""On a long trip to California, I take pills to sleep,"" she says. Her worst trip was on the Concorde plane. ""It felt very small inside.""

When she is not flying, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does office work. She plans her boss's days, goes to meetings, and makes travel plans.

She did not ask for the job. She met the manager of a music group by chance. He gave her a job. She also went to school at night to learn office work. Five years later, her boss needed a helper, and she was there at the right time.

B. David Brown

David Brown had two jobs. He was an accountant and a golf caddy. A caddy carries a golfer's bags. He liked the golf job more. You would like it too if you loved golf. But the job had some bad parts. The money is not much. You get a little money and some money if the golfer wins. Most caddies get between £25,000 and £35,000. They spend a lot of this money on travel and hotels.

He was 31 when he first worked for the golfer Greg Norman. ""You do not only carry bags. You tell the golfer what to do. You use your knowledge about the weather and the golf place.""

Later, a company saw he was good with numbers. They gave him a new job. He looks at information from the caddies. Then he studies the numbers from each day's golf game. People on TV, golf magazines, and the golfers all want to see his work.

C. Martin Fern

Martin Fern writes about food and drink for a newspaper. One of his easy jobs is to eat food in the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that cost a lot of money? ""If people have the money, it is their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a special meal than buy a microwave.""

He is a good cook. A friend asked him to write about food for a magazine. At that time, Martin had a good job at an advertising company. The writing job gave him more money. He was 42 when a newspaper called. They offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I got half the money,"" he says. ""But I could make my hobby my job.""

He still cooks all the food at home. He rides a bike two miles to the train station to stay healthy.

D. Dick Prince

It was my first children's story in a book.""

Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy. I have to think a lot,"" he says. ""I do this in the mornings. I do not get up early. After lunch, I type for two hours. I type with one finger on an old typewriter, not on a computer.""

""I get 50 to 100 letters every week. This is the best part of being a writer. I try to answer all the letters, but now a helper answers some for me.""","Is it a difficult job?

193,"Trying to get published?

If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need.
Readers of this magazine often write in saying, 'I have written this story / book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should be researching their markets and finding out about publishers as well as practising their writing skills. Turning words into a saleable commodity takes a good deal of knowledge about the 'writing game'.
Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. There are several ways of doing this, but the best one is simply by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.
As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated as new publications are constantly appearing - editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always hungry for new blood; as writers we have to make sure we give them what they want.
To begin with you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let us say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The very first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, taking special note of who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in catering to their needs.
Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never actively discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is of publishable standard; so I have to try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint.
The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about so-called success', you usually find that the person has been in the publishing trade or journalism for some years before their current success.
When you do finally send off some of your work for the first time, immediately get on with more work while you await a reply; write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you will begin to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and your confidence will grow. Don't tear any of them up-improve them instead. Also, I would advise not showing your work to anyone else, certainly in the early stages.
Don't forget that every successful writer will have had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See whether there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group which will help you to gain ideas and confidence from mixing with other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and get that writing practice in - every day if possible.",B2,,"Do you want to publish your writing?

If you are asking, ""Where can I send my story?"" our expert Margaret Stubbs can help you.

Many people write to us and say, ""I wrote a story or a book. Who should I send it to?"" First, you need to learn about publishers. You also need to practice writing. To sell your writing, you need to know how it works.

You should learn about the places where you want to publish your work. The best way to do this is to read a lot. Go to your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading will show you what kinds of writing publishers want.

You must keep learning because things change. New magazines and books appear. Editors change jobs. Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want.

Maybe you are not sure what you want to write. For example, maybe you want to write short love stories. First, find magazines that print love stories. Then, read many of these magazines. Learn what kind of stories they buy and who reads them. The editor wants stories for their readers.

Sometimes writers send me their stories and say, ""No one wants my story. Am I wasting my time?"" I always try to be positive. But often, the writing is not ready to be published. I try to give an honest but helpful answer.

Many new writers send their work out too soon. If you have only written one story, it probably will not be published. This almost never happens. When you read about a ""new"" successful writer, you often find they have been writing for years.

When you send your work out, do not wait for an answer. Start writing more stories right away. Write ten more, or even twenty. Each story will be better. You will feel more like a writer, and you will become more confident. Do not throw your stories away. Make them better instead. Also, in the beginning, it is better not to show your work to other people.

Remember, all good writers had many ""no"" answers before they got a ""yes"". Do things to help your writing. See if there is a writing class near you. If not, join a writers' group. You can get new ideas and feel more confident with other new writers. Think of yourself as a writer and try to write every day.","Do you want to publish your writing?

I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. Cycling was a release from school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, the sheltered valleys and old villages. Coming from Scotland myself, I found the landscape familiar yet different and I still go back there today. I used to describe my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, at which I subsequently made my name.

There is a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by amateurs. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep, and alongside a canal. But there is one point on the journey that I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers spy on people at random points in their day, making a cup of tea, doing the washing up, unfolding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields and sheep and a distant grey sea. That makes me look more closely, to search for something that opens my eyes.

The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and lovely coast. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks, so crowds are largely non-existent here. They attract a few brave surfers but most visitors prefer instead to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns and wild flowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who have some property in the village of Southole.

My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, or with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in an urban environment.

I purchased Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was a question of obtaining pure peace and reconnecting with my English roots and coming home. I grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway you'd never return.That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magic, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except sea, wind and birds.

'I actually look rather good in jeans. So I rarely wear them. I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.' So runs the logic of Isabel, 'our heroine' in this refreshingly zany novel. An art student of 31, devotee of historical romances, she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. Hope, however, springs eternal - which proves to be her salvation, and that of other people in the story. Employing the staccato drama-laden pace of an early silent film, with chapter headings like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired', the author writes with terrific verve.

This is a celebration of the birth and subsequent near-death of a local radio station in America. It is the wry view of a national institution - the wireless - seen through the eyes of a weedy, intelligent child, Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station set up by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to advertise their sandwich bar. Soon the station is beaming out a motley collection of singers, preachers, soap-opera heroes and continuity announcers. This small-town American setting provides the author with huge scope for the dry humour and understated prose for which he is justly praised. He skilfully transports the reader from the present back to the gentler days of the 1940s and 1950s, an era of dime stores, oil-cloth, old-fashioned Ford motor cars and, of course, the wireless.

In the world created by the author, it is quite in order for a second husband to gossip with his wive's first husband. So, when high-flying professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poetess, he naturally confides in his wive's ex. The poetess writes rotten poetry, which troubles Richards critical conscience; she's also trying to get his support for her wrongfully imprisoned brother. However, none of these complications is half as interesting as the way the author untangles them. He moves the plot along with a robust sense of the ridiculous and dissects relationships with perceptive care. It all makes for a highly enjoyable, sophisticated and witty read.

Two sets of best friends - two women, two men - meet in the London of the sixties, and for the next quarter of a century are bound together in life and death. At the outset of this long novel, one of the four, the mysterious American tycoon, James Hudson, is launching a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The launch is crucial, but so is the fact that the woman they both adored (and that one of them married) was killed some years before... Murder, ambition, love and jealousy - it's all here, and the writing's good as well. This is one of those books, in size and range, where you can really get to know the characters and be engrossed in them.

Written by one of the very best American fiction writers, this amusing and compassionate story tells how Ian Bedloe, by way of atonement for a sin that leaves him plagued with guilt, becomes 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. What with the detritus of domesticity, he is, at 40, slowly sinking into eccentric bachelorhood. The story covers much emotional ground and highlights, in canicular, the touching, tender relationship Ian develops with the youngest child, Daphne. A lovely, warm book with exactly the right balance of pathos and laughter.

196,"BRINGING UP BADGERS

'What now?' was my immediate thought, as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago, we've established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box -- a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads.
I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her.
I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours.
Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented. Three weeks after their arrival, however, I noticed that Willow seemed lethargic, although he was still taking food as normal. It was a warning sign. I should have reacted straightaway; not realising its importance, I awoke the next morning to find him dead.
The vets post mortem revealed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle feeding any animal it is important not to let it drink too fast, as liquid can overflow into the lungs. In Willows case this had caused an infection that would have been difficult to rectify, even with the help of antibiotics, in one so small.
Disheartened by my failure, I continued rearing the others. But fate works in strange ways: six days later a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. Behind some silage bags he had discovered a single male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return; the area had been disturbed too much and already the cub was cold and hungry.
Willow II joined the fold. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females and over the next few days I discovered why his mother had left him. Never had anything been so difficult to feed. To place the bottles teat in his mouth and cajole him into drinking I had to keep moving it around and squeezing it. After a full 10 minutes he would latch on to it as if he had not drunk all day. By the end of April the females were weaned on to creamed rice and then literally anything. It was to be a different story for Willow. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food, tipping it over or just sitting in it. Eventually I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages he was ready to move on to something else.
At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast; a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. The usual diet for badgers is 60 per cent earthworms, plus beetles and bugs, baby rabbits, mice and voles and even shoots or roots of plants. Certainly my badgers were much better off than other cubs that year; the summer was exceptionally hot and digging for earthworms must have been almost impossible.
By August my foundlings had begun to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often went through the cider orchard; in its long grass, everyone was fair game. The cubs would get excited, ruffle up their fur so that they looked like snowballs and chase each other's tails. As 'human badgers' we were included in this sport. I learnt to avoid those playful charges that ended with a sharp nip, but Derek accompanied us only occasionally and so never grasped this skill: his reactions to being caught were sometimes as colourful as his bruises.
It was during two of these late-night walks in the very dry period that I spotted odder badgers in our field. Presumably they were having to extend their territories to find enough food, although badgers are very territorial and will kill others that wander into their territory. We were even warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so sheet metal was placed over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers, and such was the response that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With advice freely given, we designed our badgers' new home. Daniel, one of our sons, drew up the plans and we built a sett complete with tunnels, an enclosure and a badger gate facing the same way as their nightly walks.
It had three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass side to enable people to see into the sett from a darkened enclosure. As the sett began to take shape, the badgers would explore it before going on their walks. Eventually walks were forgotten in the excitement of climbing through the tunnels and sorting out bedding.
The cost of the building work was far more than we envisaged but a local bus company (the aptly named Badgerline) sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated building materials. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own.
Early one evening they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later I crept back to see if all was well, to be met with the sight of three badgers curled up in their chambers sound asleep.
These days my walks with them are not as regular, especially as they are not fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally (she has joined a neighbouring sett) but
Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, an area that they have come to know well and a home they have readily accepted.",C1,,"Looking After Badger Babies

""What now?"" I thought, when one of my helpers gave me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I changed our farm six years ago. Now, people can visit the animals. We are also known for helping young animals that have no mother.

A strange noise came from the box. It was a mix of a laugh and a dog's bark. I looked inside. I saw three small, grey badger babies. They were only about eight inches long. Their fur was very soft. Their little black-and-white striped faces looked up at me with milky eyes.

I had never seen badger babies before. They are usually born in winter and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die and nobody finds them. Some builders found these three. Their machines broke into the badgers' home by accident. The mother was dead, and the babies were still trying to drink her milk.

The babies were healthy but cold and crying. I cleaned them and took them to my warm kitchen. I put them near the stove. I named the two girls Primrose and Bluebell, and the boy Willow.

At first, I fed them with a small tube. Before each meal, I wiped them with a warm cloth. This felt like their mother cleaning them. It helped them go to the toilet. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours.

After a week, they could drink from a bottle. They started to walk, but they were shaky. They had each other and a warm pad to sleep on, so they were happy.

Three weeks later, Willow was very tired. He still ate his food, but it was a bad sign. I did not know how serious it was. The next morning, he was dead.

The animal doctor said Willow had a sick lung. When you feed an animal from a bottle, you must be careful. If they drink too fast, the milk can go into their lungs. For a small animal like Willow, this is very dangerous.

I was very sad, but I continued to look after the two girls. Then, six days later, a local farmer came to see me. He had found a baby boy badger behind some farm bags. The mother had left him. The place was not safe, and the baby was cold and hungry.

This new baby joined us. I called him Willow II. He was two weeks younger than the girls. I soon saw why his mother left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to move the bottle around for ten minutes before he would drink.

By the end of April, the girls learned to eat soft rice and other foods. But it was different for Willow II. He did not know how to eat without making a mess. He walked in his food, turned the bowl over, or sat in it. I gave him a sausage. He played with it, chewed it, and finally ate it. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods.

When they were nearly five months old, they ate cereal for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds in the evening. Normal badgers eat a lot of worms, insects, and small animals. My badgers had better food. That summer was very hot, so it was hard for wild badgers to find worms.

By August, my badgers started to sleep in the day and be active at night. We often walked in the apple field in the evening. The badgers got very excited. Their fur stood up, and they looked like round balls. They chased each other's tails. They played with us, too. I learned to move away when they tried to bite playfully. My husband Derek did not walk with us often, so he did not learn this. He sometimes got small bites.

On two of these night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were probably looking for food because it was so dry. Badgers usually stay in their own area and can be dangerous to other badgers. People told us they might come into our badger home and hurt the babies. So, we put metal on the gate to keep them safe.

A local newspaper took pictures of me walking with the badgers. Many people saw the story. We asked for help to build a new home for the badgers on our farm. We got free advice and made a plan. Our son Daniel drew the plans. We built a home with tunnels and a special gate.

It had three rooms. One room had a glass wall so people could look inside from a dark place. While we were building it, the badgers liked to explore the tunnels. Soon, they liked their new home more than their walks.

The building cost more money than we thought. But a local bus company called Badgerline gave us some money. Other local companies gave us building things. Everyone wanted the badgers to have their own home.

One evening, the badgers finally moved in. We watched them for a little while and then left them alone. I came back half an hour later. All three badgers were curled up in their rooms, fast asleep.

Now, I don't walk with them as often. They don't wake up until midnight. We don't see Primrose much anymore. She went to live with some badgers next door. But Bluebell and Willow II still run to say hello before they hurry away into the night. This is their home now. They know the area well and they are happy here.","Looking After Badger Cubs

""What is it now?"" I thought, when one of my helpers threw a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I changed our dairy farm in Somerset into an ""open farm"" six years ago. Since then, we have become known for caring for young animals that have lost their mothers. But the sound from the box – a mix of a laugh and a dog’s bark – was new to me. I looked inside with curiosity and saw three small, grey badger cubs. Each one was only about eight inches long. Their fur was very soft, and their milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from their little black-and-white striped faces.

I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between January and March, so they usually stay underground when they are very young. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger and are never found. These three were brought to us by builders. Their machines had dug into the badgers' home before they noticed. The mother was found dead, and the babies were still trying to drink her milk.

The cubs looked healthy but were cold and crying. After I cleaned them, I took them into the farm kitchen and put them near the stove to get warm. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe. But first, I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth. This felt like their mother cleaning them and helped them go to the toilet. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours.

After a week, the cubs could drink from a bottle and started to move around, although they were a bit shaky. They had each other and a warm pad to act like a mother, so they seemed happy. But three weeks later, I saw that Willow was very tired, even though he was eating normally. This was a bad sign. I should have done something immediately. I didn't understand how serious it was, and the next morning I found him dead.

The vet told us that Willow died from an infection in his lungs. When you feed an animal from a bottle, you must not let it drink too quickly. If it does, liquid can go into the lungs. For Willow, this caused an infection. It would have been very hard to cure, even with medicine, because he was so small.

I felt very sad about my mistake, but I continued to look after the other two. Then, something unexpected happened. Six days later, a local farmer who had heard about our cubs came to see me. He had found a single male cub behind some animal food bags. Its mother had left it. He knew she would not come back because the area was too busy, and the cub was already cold and hungry.

This new cub, Willow II, joined our group. He was six weeks old, about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother had left him. He was the most difficult cub to feed. I had to move the bottle's teat around in his mouth and gently press it to make him drink. After ten minutes, he would finally start drinking as if he was very thirsty. By the end of April, the females were eating soft rice and then other foods. But it was different for Willow. He was happy to stop using the bottle, but he couldn't learn to eat without stepping in his food, knocking it over, or even sitting in it. In the end, I gave him a sausage. He slowly chewed it, played with it, and finally ate it. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods.

When they were nearly five months old, they all ate cereal for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, eggs, and seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat mostly earthworms, as well as insects, small animals, and some plants. My badgers had a much better life than other cubs that year because the summer was very hot. It must have been almost impossible for wild badgers to dig for worms.

By August, my badgers started to be active at night. They would only go for walks in the evening or late at night. We often walked through the apple orchard. In the long grass, everyone was part of the game. The cubs would get excited, make their fur stick out so they looked like round balls, and chase each other's tails. As their human family, we were included in this game. I learned to move away when they played too roughly, which sometimes ended with a small bite. Derek only came with us sometimes, so he never learned this skill. His reactions when they caught him were as loud as the marks they left on him.

During two of these late walks in the very dry weather, I saw other badgers in our field. They probably had to travel further to find enough food. Badgers are very protective of their area and will fight others that come into it. We were even told that they might come into our badger pen and kill the cubs. So, we put metal sheets over the gate to make it very hard to get in.

A local newspaper took photos of me walking with the badgers. Many people saw them and wanted to help. We started asking for money to build a badger home on the farm. With free advice, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel made the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, a safe area, and a special gate facing the direction of their nightly walks.

The sett had three rooms. One was a bit bigger than the others, and it had a glass wall so that people could look inside from a dark area. As we built the sett, the badgers would explore it before their walks. Soon, they were more interested in running through the tunnels and arranging their bedding than going for walks.

Building the sett cost much more than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline gave us some money. Other local businesses gave us building materials. It seemed that everyone wanted the badgers to have their own home.

One evening, the badgers finally moved in. We watched them for a short time and then left them to get comfortable. I returned quietly half an hour later to check on them. All three badgers were curled up in their rooms, fast asleep.

These days, I don't walk with them as often, especially because they don't fully wake up until midnight. We only see Primrose sometimes because she has joined a badger family nearby. But Bluebell and Willow II still run to say hello before they hurry away into the night. This is their home now, an area they know well and a place they are happy to live in.","CARING FOR BADGERS

'What now?' I wondered, as one of my assistants tossed a cardboard box in my direction. Six years ago, my husband Derek and I converted our Somerset dairy farm into an 'open farm,' and we have since developed a reputation for caring for orphaned animals. However, the noise emerging from the box – a mixture between a cackle and a bark – was unfamiliar. Intrigued, I peered inside to discover three small grey badger cubs, each measuring no more than eight inches. Their velvet-like fur and milky eyes gazed up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped faces.

I had never encountered badger cubs before. Since most are born between mid-January and mid-March, they typically remain underground during their early lives. If orphaned, they generally starve and are never discovered. These three had been rescued by construction workers whose machinery had accidentally broken into the badgers' sett while installing drainage pipes. The mother was found deceased, with her cubs still attempting to nurse.

The cubs appeared healthy but were cold and whimpering. After treating them for fleas, I brought them into the farmhouse kitchen and positioned them near the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. Initially, I fed them using a syringe, but first I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic their mother's grooming. This stimulation encouraged them to relieve themselves. For the initial days, they required feeding every four hours.

Within a week, the cubs had progressed to bottle feeding and were moving around, albeit unsteadily. With each other for companionship and a heated pad serving as a substitute mother, they seemed quite content. However, three weeks after their arrival, I observed that Willow appeared lethargic, despite eating normally. This was a warning sign I should have addressed immediately. Unfortunately, I failed to recognize the seriousness, and I discovered him dead the following morning.

A post-mortem examination revealed that Willow had succumbed to a lung infection. When bottle-feeding young animals, it's crucial to prevent them from drinking too rapidly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this had caused an infection that would have been challenging to treat with antibiotics given his small size.

Discouraged by this setback, I continued raising the remaining cubs. Six days later, a local farmer who had heard about our cubs visited me. He had discovered a single male cub abandoned behind some silage bags. He knew the mother wouldn't return because the area had been significantly disturbed, and the cub was already cold and hungry.

Willow II joined our group. At six weeks old, he was approximately two weeks younger than the females, and I soon understood why his mother had abandoned him. He proved extraordinarily difficult to feed. I had to persistently maneuver the bottle's teat in his mouth and gently squeeze it to persuade him to drink. After about ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn't drunk all day. By late April, the females had been weaned onto creamed rice and would eat practically anything. Willow's situation differed considerably. While he willingly abandoned the bottle, he couldn't master eating without walking through his food, spilling it, or sitting in it. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he gradually chewed, played with, and finally consumed. After a week of sausages, he became ready to try other foods.

By five months old, they were all consuming cereal for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. A typical badger diet consists of approximately 60% earthworms, supplemented by beetles, insects, small mammals, and plant matter. Certainly, my badgers were more fortunate than other cubs that year, as the exceptionally hot summer made digging for earthworms nearly impossible.

By August, my rescued badgers had become nocturnal and would only venture out at dusk or during the night. Our regular walks through the cider orchard became an adventure in the long grass. The cubs would become excited, fluffing their fur until they resembled snowballs, and chase each other's tails. As 'human badgers,' we participated in these games. I learned to avoid their playful charges that often concluded with sharp nips, but Derek, who joined us only occasionally, never acquired this skill. His reactions to being caught were often as dramatic as his bruises.

During these late-night walks in the dry period, I spotted other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territories in search of food, despite badgers being highly territorial creatures that may kill intruders. We received warnings that they might invade our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we secured the gate with sheet metal to make it as inaccessible as possible.

The local newspaper published photographs of me walking the badgers, and the public response was so positive that we launched an appeal to construct a sett on our farm. With expert advice freely provided, we designed their new home. Our son Daniel drafted the plans, and we built a complete sett featuring tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate oriented toward their nightly walking route.

The sett contained three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass panel allowing observation from a darkened enclosure. As construction progressed, the badgers would explore the developing sett before their walks. Eventually, the excitement of navigating tunnels and arranging bedding replaced their interest in walks.

Construction costs significantly exceeded our initial estimates, but a local bus company named Badgerline sponsored part of the appeal, and local businesses donated building materials. It appeared everyone wanted these badgers to have a permanent home.

One early evening, they finally moved in. After observing them briefly, we left them to settle. When I returned quietly half an hour later, I found all three badgers curled up in their chambers, fast asleep.

These days I walk with them less frequently, particularly since they aren't fully active until midnight. We only occasionally see Primrose, who has joined a neighboring sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still rush to greet us before darting off into the night. This has become their territory now – an area they know thoroughly and a home they have fully embraced.",,
197,"Blacksmiths

THROUGHOUT the ages, iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination, and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers, because they were the sole providers of weapons, armour and farming tools.
They have also been feted as artises. Eighteenth-century smiths produced the wonderfully baroque ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The sinuous metalwork of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was always the work of a talented blacksmith.
But practitioners of these ancient skills had become almost extinct in Britain by the late 1960s, for heavy industry had ceased to have any use for them, and towerblock architects rarely used anything as graceful and pleasing as a wrought-iron handrail.
Over the past 10 years, however, there has been something of a revival - thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Even so, much of the work looks surprisingly cliched: manufacturers of gates and balconies still advertise their wares as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. You cant walk into a trendy design store without being assailed by rusty candlesticks with dangly bits.
Thankfully, alternatives exist and a series of events over the next few weeks aims to promote the blacksmiths craft. The first of these, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the
Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.
Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says: 'We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because, in a sense, both the general public and blacksmiths have had their blinkers removed.' Power tools have liberated smiths from all that labouring over a hot anvil, and they can now bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material which allows them to express themselves.'
About 250 pieces have been produced for the show, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at PS90 and climb well into four figures. Most of the money raised will go to individual makers, 'but a percentage of every sale will be retained by the Association for the promotion of good ironwork,' says Dawson.
His own contributions consist of an eight-foot gate, and a standard lamp topped with a mouth-blown glass shade.
'My style results from just allowing steel to bend and flow into shape when its hot. It's a bit like drawing with metal in space,' he says.
Many of the artists admit to being fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are relatively malleable when cold, iron and steel are a tougher, more demanding medium. Susan May, a jeweller by training, says, 'It's quite magical, because its incredibly soft when its hot, but as soon as it cools down, it becomes really rigid and immovable again.'
Ann Catrin Evans' mild steel door-knockers and handles seem to have been inspired by those bleak castles that are a stock feature of horror films. One of her designs is shaped like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love the fact that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And the way it feels as though its there forever.'
No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good, to say the least as long as we don't have to look at any more rusty Candlesticks, that is.",C1,,,"Blacksmiths

For a very long time, people have been interested in iron. The people who work with it were often seen as more than just workers. Before machines were used in factories, blacksmiths were as important as doctors. They were the only ones who made weapons, armour, and tools for farming.

They were also seen as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths made beautiful iron designs for St Paul's Cathedral. The curved metal in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was always made by a skilled blacksmith.

But by the late 1960s, there were almost no blacksmiths left in Britain. Big factories did not need them, and architects building tall blocks of flats did not use nice iron things like handrails.

However, in the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become a bit more popular again. This is because people are more interested in decorative buildings and home design. Still, a lot of the work you see is not very original. Companies that make gates and balconies often call them 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. In many modern design shops, you see the same old rusty candlesticks.

Luckily, there are other choices. Over the next few weeks, some events will try to show people the skill of blacksmithing. The first is an exhibition of ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). It started last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Alan Dawson from BABA says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age. Now, both the public and blacksmiths can see new possibilities."" Modern tools mean blacksmiths don't have to work so hard with a hot anvil. They can now bend and join metal more easily. Dawson says, ""In short, these artists now have a material that lets them be creative.""

The show has about 250 pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and go up to thousands of pounds. Most of the money will go to the artists. Dawson says, ""But some money from each sale will go to the Association to help promote good ironwork.""

Dawson has made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a handmade glass shade for the show. He says, ""My style happens when I let the hot steel bend into shape. It is a bit like drawing with metal in the air.""

Many of the artists say they love working with iron. Unlike other metals, iron and steel are hard to work with when they are cold. Susan May, who is trained as a jeweller, says, ""It's quite magical because it is very soft when it's hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and strong again.""

Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles from steel. Her designs look like things from old castles in horror films. One is shaped like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard. It feels like it will last forever.""

No other simple metal has given people so much beauty or made them feel so safe. It is very likely that iron will be used for decoration for the next thousand years – as long as we don't have to see any more rusty candlesticks.","Blacksmiths

198,"Talking shop

Ever entered a store and come away with more than you intended to buy? We reveal the selling devices shops use that are designed to make you spend, spend, spend.

A. The image of freshness 

Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They may place their fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale, to enhance this. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store. The colour of the store's fixtures may heighten the image, too - for example, green may be used because of its association with fresh produce. The bulk of what supermarkets sell -
pre-packaged grocery items such as frozen foods and washing powders - may be quite different from this image.

B. Displaying to advantage

The location of products in the store is considered all-important in determining how well a particular brand sells. Nowhere is this more developed than in supermarkets. With computerised stock-control, supermarkets can find out the parts of the store from which shoppers will select items most often. In these areas can be found products with the highest mark-ups or ones which, though less profitable, sell very quickly. 
Traditionally in retailing, 'eye-level means 'buy-level' -- shelves at eye height are eagerly sought by manufacturers, or may be reserved for certain own-brand items. 'Dump bins' containing special offers tempt those who find it hard to resist a bargain.
Increasingly popular is 'complementation' - placing dessert or salad dressings, say, over units containing ice-creams or items that may be eaten with salads such as burgers.

C. Spreading staples around the store

Supermarkets may spread low price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores and a long way from the entrance - shoppers have to pass tempting, higher-profit lines on the way. In similar vein, chainstores may locate the products they have a good reputation for as far away from the store entrance as possible. They can rely on a degree of customer loyalty towards these products, so they gamble that shoppers will go actively looking for them around the store, passing other wares that might tempt them.

D. Less sells more

Chainstores have transformed the presentation of their wares in recent years. Much of the pioneering work has been done by the Next chain, which turned away from the 'pile them high, sell them cheap' approach to popular fashion. Next stores have a 'boutique' appeal - they're noted for displaying limited fashion-wear on the shelves, giving the impression that the merchandise is exclusive. Of course, Next's clothing is not less mass-produced than that of their rivals - the company's success is as much a testament to good store design as it is to well-designed clothing.

E. Tempting totals

Food shoppers, it seems, are more responsive to the overall size of their weekly or fortnightly bill than to the prices of individual items. Supermarkets take advantage of this by stocking a mix of low mark-up staples and high mark-up items, so it shouldn't be assumed everything that a supermarket sells is cheap. Low prices are of direct appeal to the thrifty shopper.
It's often said that supermarkets deliberately lose money on certain staples to draw shoppers in - known as 'loss leaders'. More commonly, their low prices are achieved by buying in huge quantities from manufacturers, by offering them a prominent place to display their products or by exceeding sales targets - all of which attract big discounts from the manufacturers.

F. The all-important price-tag

Shoppers tend to buy fewer items in chainstores and may be more aware of individual pricing as a result. So the importance of pricing, say, a blouse at PS14.99 as opposed to PS15, still holds. (It's also a useful device, apparently, to reduce theft among the shop's own staff, who are obliged to ring up a sale in order to give the penny change.)

G. Lighting to effect

Both supermarkets and chainstores give careful thought to lighting. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible so that shoppers get a fair idea of what the colour of the clothes will be like in daylight. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.

H. Walk this way

Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'. It's not always successful - some shoppers are reluctant to stray off the routes into the sales areas. Marks and Spencer for example, use wood or marble covering for routes, encouraging shoppers to walk on to the more welcoming carpet in sales areas.

I. In-store promotion

As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you - irresistible if you've had nothing to eat before setting out on your shopping trip. In the United States, 'video trolleys' are being tried out in a number of supermarkets. Each trolley has a screen which advertises products as you shop. Sensors at the end of shelves trigger relevant advertising - so the shopper passing the cook-chill cabinets, say, may receive an ad on the screen for ready-made moussaka. Such trolleys are aimed unashamedly at the impulse shopper, and the makers claim they increase sales by around 30 per cent.",C1,"Shopping in Stores

Do you go to a store and buy more than you want? We tell you how stores make you spend more money.

A. Fresh Food

Stores know people like fresh food. They put fruits and vegetables near the door. They have a bakery in the store. The smell of fresh bread is good. The store uses green colors. Green makes us think of fresh food. But many things in the store are not fresh.

B. Where Things Are

Where things are in the store is important. Stores put popular things where people look. Things at eye level sell well. Stores have boxes with cheap things. Sometimes they put things together that people use together.

C. Cheap Things Are Far

Stores put cheap things like bread far from the door. You walk past other things to find them. Some stores put popular things far away. You walk through the store and see other things to buy.

D. Few Clothes

Some stores show only a few clothes. This makes the clothes look special. People think they are not like other clothes. But these clothes are made in big numbers. The store looks nice, and that helps them sell.

E. How Much Money

People think about all the money they spend on food. Stores sell some cheap things and some expensive things. Not everything is cheap. Sometimes stores sell things for very little money to get people to come.

F. The Price

When you buy only a few things, you look at the price. A price of $14.99 looks better than $15.00. This small difference is important.

G. The Lights

Stores think about the lights. Clothes stores use lights like the sun. This shows you the true color of the clothes. Food stores use special lights to make food look good.

H. The Floor

Many stores use different floors. One floor shows you where to walk. Another floor shows you where the things to buy are. People usually walk on the path. One store uses wood for the path. This makes people walk onto the carpet where the things for sale are.

I. Pictures in the Store

When you go into a food store, you see big pictures of nice food. This makes you hungry. In America, some stores have shopping carts with a screen. The screen shows you ads for products. When you walk near some food, an ad for that food appears. This is for people who buy things without a plan. The company says stores sell more with these carts.","**Shopping Secrets**

Have you ever gone to a shop and bought more than you planned? We will show you the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.

**A. Making Things Look Fresh**

Shops know people like fresh food. So, they put fruit and vegetables near the door. Sometimes they have a bakery inside. The smell of fresh bread makes you want to buy. They use colours like green to make you think of fresh food. But many things in the shop, like frozen food, are not fresh.

**B. Where Things Are**

Where a product is in the shop is important. Shops put things that make more money in the best spots. The shelves you see easily are the best. Shops also put special offers in big boxes. This attracts people who like a good price. Sometimes, they put things that go together nearby, like ice cream and sauce.

**C. Moving Basic Items**

Shops often put cheap things like bread and milk far from the door. You must walk past other, more expensive things to find them. Other shops do this with their popular items. They hope you will see and buy other things on your way.

**D. Less to Sell More**

Some clothes shops show only a few of each item. This makes the clothes seem special. But these clothes are often made in big factories, like other shops. The nice shop makes people want to buy.

**E. The Total Cost**

People who buy food often think about the total cost, not each price. Shops sell some things cheaply and other things for more money. Not everything is cheap. Sometimes, shops sell a few things at a very low price to bring people in. They can do this because they buy a lot.

**F. The Price Tag**

In clothes shops, people buy fewer things, so they look at the price more. A price of £14.99 seems cheaper than £15. This small difference is important.

**G. Using Light**

Shops think about their lights. Clothes shops use light like the sun. This helps you see the true colour of the clothes. Food shops use special lights to make fresh food look better.

**H. Where You Walk**

Many shops use different floors. One floor is for walking, and another is for looking at things. People usually follow the walking path. Some shops use hard floors for walking and soft carpets for shopping. This makes people move to the carpet to see products.

**I. Ads in the Shop**

When you go into a big food shop, you see big pictures of nice food. This can make you hungry and more likely to buy. In some places, shopping carts have a small screen. The screen shows you ads for products as you walk. This is for people who buy things without a plan, and it makes them buy more.","Have you ever gone into a shop and bought more than you planned? We explain the tricks shops use to make you spend more money.

A. Making things look fresh

Supermarkets know that shoppers like fresh food. They often put fruit and vegetables near the entrance, or even sell plants there. This makes the shop feel fresh. Some shops have a bakery inside, so the smell of fresh bread fills the air. The colours in the shop can also help. For example, green makes people think of fresh food. But most of what supermarkets sell is not fresh, like frozen food or washing powder.

B. Where to put products

Where a product is placed in a shop is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find the best places. They put products that make the most money or sell very fast in these spots. Products at eye level sell best. Shops also use special boxes with offers to attract people who love a good deal. Another trick is to put related items together, like ice cream and desserts.

C. Moving basic items around

Supermarkets often put cheap, basic things like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This means you have to walk past other, more expensive items to find them. Other shops do this too. They put their popular products at the back, hoping you will see and buy other things on your way.

D. Showing less to sell more

Some shops now show only a few items instead of many. For example, the Next chain shows a small amount of clothes. This makes the clothes seem special and not for everyone. In reality, these clothes are made in large numbers, just like their competitors' clothes.

E. The total bill

Shoppers often think about their total shopping bill, not the price of each item. Supermarkets use this by selling some cheap things and some expensive things. Not everything in a supermarket is cheap. Sometimes they sell certain items at a loss to bring customers in. More often, they get low prices by buying a lot from suppliers.

F. The price tag

In some shops, people buy fewer items, so they notice prices more. That's why a price like £14.99 is used instead of £15. It seems cheaper. This also helps stop staff from stealing, as they have to open the till to give change.

G. Using light

Shops think carefully about lighting. Clothes shops use light that is like daylight, so you can see the true colour of the clothes. Supermarkets use special lights (and mirrors) to make food, especially fruit and vegetables, look better.

H. Guiding customers

Many shops use different floor coverings to guide people. One type is for walking paths, and another is for areas where you can buy things. Shoppers usually follow these paths. For example, Marks and Spencer uses hard floors for paths and soft carpet in sales areas to make them feel welcoming.

I. Advertising inside the shop

When you enter a supermarket, you might see big, colourful pictures of delicious food. This is very tempting if you are hungry. In the USA, some supermarkets are testing shopping trolleys with screens. These screens show ads for products as you walk past them. For example, if you are near frozen meals, you might see an ad for one. These trolleys are for people who buy on impulse, and they can increase sales a lot.","Have you ever gone into a shop and ended up buying more than you planned? We explain the methods shops use to make you spend more money.

A. Creating a fresh image

Supermarkets know from their research that customers value fresh products. They often put fruit and vegetables near the entrance, or even plants for sale, to create this feeling. They may also have a bakery inside the store, so the smell of fresh bread spreads through the air. The colours used in the shop can also help this image – for example, green is often used because it reminds people of fresh food. However, most of what supermarkets sell – things like frozen food and washing powder – is actually very different from this fresh image.

B. Product placement

Where products are placed in a shop is very important for sales. This is especially true in supermarkets. Using computers to track products, supermarkets can find the areas where customers shop most often. They put products with the highest prices or those that sell very fast in these spots. In shops, the shelves at eye level are the most valuable. Manufacturers want their products there, or the shop may use them for their own brand. Special offer baskets attract customers who love a good deal. Another popular method is 'complementation' – for example, putting desserts near the ice cream, or salad dressings near foods like burgers.

C. Spreading basic items around

Supermarkets often place basic, low-price items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This means customers have to walk past more expensive, tempting products to find them. Similarly, chain stores put the products they are famous for far from the door. They know customers will look for these items, and on the way, they might see and want other things.

D. Less stock sells more

Chain stores have changed how they show their products in recent years. The Next chain led this change by moving away from selling lots of cheap clothes. Next shops feel more like small, stylish boutiques. They show only a few items on display, making the clothes seem special and exclusive. In reality, Next's clothes are made in large numbers, just like their competitors'. Their success comes as much from good shop design as from the clothes themselves.

E. The final bill

Food shoppers seem to care more about their total weekly shopping cost than the price of each item. Supermarkets use this by selling a mix of cheap basic goods and more expensive items. So, not everything in a supermarket is a good price. Low prices attract careful shoppers. Sometimes, supermarkets sell certain basic products at a loss to bring customers in – these are called 'loss leaders'. More often, their low prices come from buying huge amounts from suppliers, which allows them to get big discounts.

F. The price tag

People usually buy fewer items in chain stores, so they notice individual prices more. This is why shops still price a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15. It is also a simple way to prevent theft by staff, as they have to open the cash register to give the one penny change.

G. The effect of lighting

Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use lighting that is like natural daylight. This helps customers see the true colour of the clothes. In supermarkets, special lights (and mirrors) are used to make certain foods, especially fresh fruit and vegetables, look better.

H. Guiding the customer

Many chain stores use different floor coverings to guide people. One type of carpet is used for the main paths through the shop, and another marks the areas where you can buy things. Customers naturally follow these paths, which shops call the 'Yellow Brick Road'. This doesn't always work – some people don't like to leave the path to look at products. For example, Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for the walkways, which encourages shoppers to step onto the more comfortable carpet in the sales areas.

I. Advertising inside the shop

When you enter a supermarket, you often see large, colourful pictures of delicious-looking food like roasts and cakes. This is very tempting if you are shopping on an empty stomach. In the United States, some supermarkets are testing 'video trolleys'. These trolleys have a screen that shows advertisements as you shop. Sensors on the shelves make the screen show ads for products you are near. For example, if you walk past ready-made meals, you might see an ad for one. These trolleys are clearly meant for people who buy on impulse, and the companies say they increase sales by about 30%.",,
199,"From here to paternity

A. The theatre director

Because of my bizarre personal life, which I cannot be proud of, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about.
I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become a friend rather than a father.
I don't believe in physical violence. I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me. As soon as you start chasing them to ask why they have not been in touch, you impose this terrible burden of guilt. My parents did it to me and I would never do it to my children.

B. The advertising executive 

I was young when they were born, only around 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite irksome. It aged me quickly, but at the same time it kept me young, which is something I have always valued. 
As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I could have drifted away from: music, youth culture, clothes. In a funny way that has been invaluable as far as running the agency has been concerned. I have never felt out of touch. 
Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.
They get on well with a lot of our friends and they come to parties with us and advertising awards ceremonies without feeling intimidated. I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting.

C. The politician

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected onto the Greater London Council, and the others followed in quite quick succession. My wife and I vowed that we would carve out time for them but since I have become more and more politically active, time has become a real problem. 
I make it a condition that I will only accept weekend meetings and public appearances where there are facilities for one or more of the kids to come with me. If I did not they would just get squeezed out. This way they have a sense of what I do when I am not with them and there is no feeling of Daddy disappearing.
I've noticed more and more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more conscious of the need to involve our children in our lives.

D. The writer

My first marriage broke up when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I was forced to examine the whole area of fatherhood more closely than I might otherwise have done. I made enormous efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even experimented with living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wished, but I think Kate and Bonnie would say now that they found that quite confusing.
Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. It is true I was around a lot, but, like a lot of Seventies parents, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining only the other day that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more systems, more order. Instead I took this very loose approach. I regret that now.
I still worry about my elder daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way your kids never leave you.

E. The TV presenter

I was ready for kids. I'd hit 30, met my wife, we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why carry on going to the shops every Saturday spending our money on new sofas, when we could have a kid instead?""
Having my daughter Betty has forced me to come to terms with who I am and what I am. You feel you are doing something very special when you conceive a child, and you are. But you are also becoming just one more parent in a great long line of parents. It's a great leveller.
I do resent it occasionally but if ever there is a moment of irritation, it is dispelled by just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest self-preservation mechanism in the world. It can melt a grown man.",C1,,"**A. The theatre director**

My life is a bit strange, but I am happy. For 35 years, I have had small children. I loved every minute. I fed the baby this morning. For me, that is what a father does.

I am very lucky with my children. We all like the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This makes us close. Now they are mostly adults. I am more like a friend than a father.

I do not like hitting. Sometimes I was angry and I hit my children. But I do not think it is good. I know I was not a perfect father, but I was always there. They can call me if they need me. I never ask them why they don't call. My parents did that to me. It made me feel bad. I will never do that to my children.

**B. The advertising executive**

I was young when my children were born. I was about 25. It was difficult to have so much to do. It made me feel older, but it also kept me young. I like that.

When they became teenagers, they showed me new music and new clothes. This helped me with my job. I always knew about new things.

When they were young, I was very busy with my work. I missed some important days, like their first concerts. I am sad about that. But now I can do nice things with them. We can go on holiday to the south of France.

They are friends with our friends. They come to our parties and to my work events. They are not shy. I think it is good that my job is fun for them.

**C. The politician**

My first child was born when I started my job in politics. Then I had more children very fast. My wife and I wanted to be with them, but I became very busy with work. Time is a big problem.

I have a rule. I only go to work meetings on the weekend if my children can come. If I don't do this, I would not see them. This way, they know what I do when I am not at home. They don't think their dad is gone.

I see more politicians bringing their children to work. Maybe we all know now that it is good to have our children in our lives.

**D. The writer**

My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. So I thought a lot about being a father. I tried very hard to see my children. For a short time, my ex-wife and I lived next to each other. The children could go between the houses. But I think Kate and Bonnie found this confusing.

Kate says I was always there for her. But I am not sure I was a very good father. It is true I was with them a lot. But I think I treated them like adults when they were too young. Kate said recently we did not have enough rules. I think I should have had more rules. I feel bad about that now.

I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest daughter. Your children are always your children.

**E. The TV presenter**

I was ready to have children. I was 30 years old. I met my wife and we had a nice house. We thought, ""Why spend money on new things for the house? Let's have a child.""

My daughter Betty has helped me understand myself. When you have a child, you feel you are doing something very special. And you are. But you are also just another parent, like all parents. It makes everyone the same.

Sometimes I feel a little angry, but that feeling goes away when I look at her. A baby's smile is the best way to make someone happy. It can make a grown man feel soft.","**A. The theatre director**

A. The theatre director

Due to my unusual personal life, which I am not proud of, I have spent 35 years with young children and I can honestly say I have enjoyed every moment. This morning I had the pleasure of feeding the baby, and for me, that is what fatherhood is all about.
I consider myself very fortunate with my children. We all share the same interests: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, particularly now they are mostly adults and I have become more of a friend than a father.
I don't believe in physical punishment. I must admit I have slapped my children when angry, but I don't approve of it. I'm certain I haven't been a perfect father, but I've always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, but only if they contact me first. If you start questioning why they haven't been in touch, you create a burden of guilt. My parents did this to me, and I would never do it to my children.

B. The advertising executive

I was quite young when my children were born, only about 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and restrictions challenging. It made me mature quickly, yet it also kept me feeling young, which I've always valued.
As they became teenagers, they reintroduced me to aspects of life I might have lost touch with: music, youth culture, and fashion. Surprisingly, this has been extremely valuable for managing my agency. I've never felt disconnected from current trends.
Because I was focused on building my business during their early years, I missed certain milestones: first concerts, sports days. I regret that, but there are compensations now, such as being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.
They interact comfortably with our friends and join us at parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling awkward. I believe it's been beneficial that they view my career as glamorous and interesting.

Kate has stated in interviews that I was always available, but I'm uncertain whether I was a good father. While I was physically present often, like many parents in the Seventies, I think I treated my children as adults too early. Kate recently commented that we were too permissive.

200,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING

I thought everyone would be pleased, but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. 'What do you mean?' she raged. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?'
I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day, life-long smoker, and four hours later I was not, was faintly irritating. I find it curious myself.
The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago.
I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. For one thing, I wholly resented the remorseless pressure from the anti-smoking mob - and I still do. For another, I had low blood pressure and a long-living and healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and threw off colds more easily, it seemed to me, than friends with consciously healthier lifestyles.
On that unexceptional Thursday afternoon, I had simply gone along to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to give up. 'I shan't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I announced firmly. 'Since my motivation for being here is writing, not stopping, it would not be right to expect your method to work on me.'
I could not have been more reasonable. After all, I positively enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me rather knowingly.
We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wished and most of the afternoon was conducted in a room so smoke-filled that we had to open the windows.
I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others.
I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense. Just as smoking itself had become a challenge in the face of opposition, so the notion of stopping began to feel attractive.
The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world?
In many senses, it was easy. The physical craving, the pangs of desire for nicotine, in just the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two and I experienced them over only four or five days.
The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order.
Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing - and it still is.
I am increasingly coming to the view dat for me smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself.
Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes.",C1,,"The Day I Stopped Smoking

I thought everyone would be happy, but one woman at my work was very angry. ""What?"" she said loudly. ""If it was easy, why not stop before?""

I cannot say how I changed. One day I smoked a lot. A few hours later, I stopped. It is strange for me too.

The stop-smoking meeting was two months and three weeks ago. We talked in a group and someone helped us relax.

I did not want to stop smoking. I did not like people telling me to stop. I am healthy. My family lives a long time. I did not cough. I got better from colds fast.

That Thursday, I went to a meeting in Birmingham. I went to write about people trying to stop. ""I will not stop,"" I said. ""I am here to write.""

I was being fair. I liked smoking. It made me happy. The teacher looked at me in a funny way.

We could smoke a lot. The room had lots of smoke. We opened the windows.

Something was interesting. When they said ""smoke now,"" I did not want to. The other people did not want to either.

The stop-smoking ideas were good in my head. Before, I liked smoking when people said no. Now, I liked the idea of stopping.

Not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was my secret. Can I do anything?

In many ways, it was easy. The want for a cigarette went away fast. It lasted four or five days.

My work was easy without cigarettes. I thought I needed to smoke to work. I was wrong.

The hardest time is at home on Saturday and Sunday mornings. It still is.

I think I smoked when I had nothing to do. Smoking was something to do.

Yes, I miss cigarettes, but not much. New things are different now - eating out, waiting for a plane, staying in a hotel, waiting at the theatre. Before, I always smoked at these times.","The Day I Stopped Smoking

I thought everyone would be happy, but one of my work friends was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was so easy, why didn't you stop a long time ago?""

I couldn't explain how I changed from someone who smoked a lot every day to a non-smoker in just one afternoon. Even I find it strange.

The stop-smoking meeting was a mix of group talking and hypnosis. It happened exactly two months and three weeks ago.

I didn't plan to stop smoking and I didn't really want to. I didn't like people telling me I should stop - and I still don't. Also, I was healthy and my family usually lives a long time. I didn't cough or feel sick, and I got better from colds faster than my healthy friends.

That Thursday afternoon, I went to the stop-smoking meeting in Birmingham only to write about other people trying to quit. ""I won't try to stop myself,"" I said clearly. ""I'm here to write, not to stop smoking.""

I thought I was being very reasonable. After all, I really liked smoking. It made me happy. I thought the teacher looked at me like she knew something.

They told us we could smoke as much as we wanted. The room became so full of smoke that we had to open the windows.

I found it interesting that when they told me to smoke, I didn't want to - and neither did the others.

I think the stop-smoking ideas made sense in my mind. Just like smoking felt good when people said I shouldn't, now stopping started to feel good.

The idea of not being a smoker began to make me feel strong. It was my private feeling. Could I do anything now?

In many ways, it was easy. The physical need for nicotine, which feels like hunger, went away after a minute or two. This only happened for four or five days.

My work - which I thought would be very hard without cigarettes - wasn't a problem at all. I really believed I couldn't work without nicotine, but I was wrong.

Surprisingly, the hardest thing was being at home on weekend mornings - and it still is.

I'm starting to think that for me, smoking was mostly about fighting boredom. Having a cigarette was something to do.

Yes, I miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is different - eating in restaurants, waiting for planes, staying in hotels, or theater breaks. These were all times when I used to smoke.","The Day I Stopped Smoking

I thought everyone would be happy for me, but one of my co-workers was very angry. 'What are you talking about?' she shouted. 'If it was so simple, why didn't you quit years ago?'

I understand that it was a bit annoying that I couldn't explain how I changed from being a heavy smoker to a non-smoker in just one afternoon. Even I find it strange.

The stop-smoking session was a mix of group discussion and hypnotherapy. It happened exactly two months and three weeks ago.

I hadn't planned to quit, and I didn't really want to. First, I really disliked the constant pressure from people who are against smoking - and I still do. Second, I have low blood pressure and come from a healthy family that lives a long time. I didn't cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds more easily than my friends who had healthier habits.

That ordinary Thursday afternoon, I had only gone to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write about other people trying to quit. 'I won't be trying to stop myself, that wouldn't be fair,' I said clearly. 'Since I'm here to write, not to stop smoking, it wouldn't be right to expect your method to work on me.'

I thought I was being completely reasonable. After all, I really enjoyed smoking. It made me happy. I noticed the counselor looked at me as if she knew something I didn't.

We were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and most of the afternoon we spent in a room so full of smoke that we had to open the windows.

I found it interesting that when we were told to smoke, I didn't want to - and neither did the others.

I think what happened was that the reasons for stopping smoking made sense to me intellectually. Just like smoking had become a challenge when people told me not to do it, the idea of stopping started to seem appealing.

The possibility of not being a smoker was starting to make me feel strong. It was a private feeling that only concerned me. Could I achieve anything?

In many ways, it was easy. The physical need for nicotine, which feels like hunger, went away after a minute or two, and I only experienced this for four or five days.

My work - which I thought would be the hardest thing to do without cigarettes - didn't cause any problems at all. I had really believed that I wouldn't be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that for the first time I wouldn't be able to write an article when I needed to.

Surprisingly, the most difficult thing was spending relaxed weekend mornings at home - and it still is.

I'm starting to believe that for me, smoking was mainly about dealing with boredom; having a cigarette was something to do.

Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new situation as a non-smoker requires attention - eating in restaurants, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theater break. These are all important moments when I would have smoked before.",,
201,"Tapping into a food supply

In the forests of Madagascar there lives a primate with a lifestyle remarkably like a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the primate, the rare and elusive aye-aye, bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae. The woodpecker, of course, uses its beak for chiselling into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey; the aye-aye, on the other hand, uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Though the aye-aye's strange way of feeding was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only now discovered how it locates the insects hidden inside the wood.
Dr Carl Erickson, of Duke University's Primate Center, has been investigating the hunting skills of two captive males, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her infant daughter, Annabelle (Animal Behaviour, vol. 41 pp. 793-802). He first tested whether they found insects just by looking for the telltale visual signs of their presence. For example, holes on the surface might indicate sites where female insects had entered the wood and laid their eggs. Dr Erickson presented the aye-ayes with logs in which he had drilled several narrow holes. Some holes led to cavities containing mealworms while others were blank dead-ends. The aye-ayes went straight for the cavities with food, gnawing through the wood and clearly not requiring the visual clues of surface holes.
Perhaps the aye-ayes were locating the mealworms by their smell or the sounds they were making. But further tests showed that they didn't use these clues either. Logs in which the smell of the insects was prevented from leaking out presented no problem, and the aye-ayes also located dead (and therefore silent) mealworms.
If they weren't seeing, smelling or hearing the insects, how were the aye-ayes able to find them? Dr Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those containing mealworms. They could apparently sense the cavity itself.
When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. Dr Erickson suggests that the animal is echo-locating, listening and perhaps feeling for reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.
The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are birds, such as the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, which do probe for or glean insects from wood, and so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant. Not only can the aye-aye be regarded as a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat rolled into one, but it also behaves like a squirrel (indeed, it was originally classified as one). Its incisors grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has recently been observed in the wild gnawing through the shells of nuts, and extracting the meat of the nut with its elongated finger.",C1,"In Madagascar, there is a forest. In the forest, there is an animal. It is called an aye-aye. The aye-aye looks for food. A woodpecker bird also looks for food like this. They both want to eat bugs inside wood.

The woodpecker uses its beak and its long tongue. The aye-aye uses its teeth and a long finger.

A man studied the aye-aye. He is a scientist. He wanted to know how the aye-aye finds the bugs. He gave the aye-aye some wood. The wood had holes. Some holes had food inside. Some holes had no food. The aye-aye found the food. It did not use its eyes. It did not use its nose. It did not use its ears to hear the bugs.

How did it find the food? The aye-aye taps on the wood. It has big ears. It listens. It can hear if there is a hole under the wood. It can hear if a bug moves.

In Madagascar, there are no woodpeckers. The aye-aye does the woodpecker's job. But some birds also look for bugs in wood. The aye-aye is a special animal. It is like a woodpecker and a bat. It also eats nuts like a squirrel. It uses its long finger to get the food from the nut.","In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called an aye-aye. It is like a woodpecker. Both look for insects inside trees. The woodpecker uses its beak and long tongue. The aye-aye uses its teeth and a long thin finger.

A scientist studied how aye-ayes find insects. He gave them pieces of wood with small holes. Some holes had food inside, and some did not. The aye-ayes always found the food. They did not need to see holes on the wood.

They also did not use smell or sound to find the food. They could find dead insects that made no noise.

So how did they find the insects? The scientist saw that aye-ayes could find empty spaces inside the wood. When they look for food, they tap on the wood with their finger. They listen with their big ears. They can hear if there is a hole or an insect inside.

In Madagascar, there are no woodpeckers. The aye-aye does the woodpecker's job. But some birds also look for insects in trees. The aye-aye is also like a bat because it listens for echoes. It is like a squirrel too. Its teeth keep growing, and it can open nuts with its teeth and get the food inside with its long finger.","In the forests of Madagascar, there is a rare animal called the aye-aye. It is a primate, but it lives a lot like a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects that live inside trees. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to catch the insects. The aye-aye uses its front teeth to bite into the wood and a very long, thin finger to find and pull out the insects. People knew about this way of eating more than one hundred years ago, but scientists have only just learned how the aye-aye finds the insects inside the wood.

A scientist named Dr. Carl Erickson studied how aye-ayes hunt. He worked with a few aye-ayes that live in a special center. First, he wanted to know if they used their eyes to find insects. For example, maybe they looked for small holes on the wood where insects go in. He gave them logs with small holes that he made. Some holes led to food, but others did not. The aye-ayes always went to the holes with food. They did not need to see holes on the surface.

Next, the scientist thought maybe the aye-ayes used smell or sound. But more tests showed they did not need these clues either. They could find food even when they could not smell it, and they could find dead insects that made no sound.

So how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson saw that they sometimes bit into wood even when there was no food inside. They seemed to know there was a hollow space there.

When an aye-aye looks for food, it taps on the wood with its long middle finger. It also moves its very big ears forward to listen carefully. The scientist thinks the aye-aye is listening to the sound of the tap. If the wood is hollow underneath, the sound is different. It might also hear insects moving when it taps.

Some people think the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar because there are no woodpeckers there. But there are other birds that also look for insects in wood. So, maybe the woodpecker’s job is already taken. The aye-aye is special because it is like a woodpecker and a bat that uses sound to find things, all in one animal. It also acts a bit like a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing, like a squirrel’s, and people have seen it bite into nuts and use its long finger to get the food inside.","In the forests of Madagascar, there is a rare primate called the aye-aye. Its way of life is very similar to a woodpecker's. Both animals search for insect larvae by making holes in wood and checking spaces inside. The woodpecker uses its beak to break into the wood and its long tongue to catch insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its front teeth to chew through wood and its long, thin third finger to find and pull out the insects. Although scientists first described this unusual feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how the aye-aye finds insects hidden inside the wood.

Dr Carl Erickson from Duke University’s Primate Center studied the hunting skills of several aye-ayes. He first wanted to know if they found insects just by looking for signs on the surface, such as small holes. He gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes that he had made. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, chewing through the wood without needing to see any surface clues.

Next, Dr Erickson tested whether the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. But even when the smell was blocked, or the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them. So how did they do it? Dr Erickson noticed that they also chewed into empty spaces. It seemed they could sense the hollow areas inside the wood.

When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and moves its large ears forward, pointing them in front of its nose. Dr Erickson believes the aye-aye is using a kind of echolocation—listening and perhaps feeling for vibrations that show there is a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

Some scientists think the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar, where there are no woodpeckers. However, there are other birds there that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker’s role may not be empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and a bat that uses echolocation, but it also behaves like a squirrel. In fact, it was once classified as a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing like a squirrel’s, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat out.",,

CHARLES SPENCER

A. Tamburlaine the Great

Marlowe's ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending, but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands' staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe's play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. Antony Sher is in terrific form in the title role, somersaulting from the balcony, sliding down a rope head-first as he delivers a speech, demanding and getting the audience's complete attention as his eyes glint with a mad lust for power and glory. Great stuff.
Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (01789 295623)

B. Women Laughing

Welcome London transfer for the late Michael Wall's fine play, seen at the Manchester Royal Exchange in May. The first act creates an atmosphere of unsettling menace as two married couples chat on a sunny suburban lawn. In the second half the location shifts and the piece becomes a powerful, compassionate study of the devastating effects of illness. The British theatre lost a talent of great promise when Wall died at the tragically early age of 44.
Royal Court Theatre, London SW1 (0207 730 1745)

C. Amphibians

Billy Roche is the latest in the long line of Irish dramatists to have enriched the English stage. All his plays to date have been set in his native Wexford, and this latest piece explores the decline of the fishing industry with his usual mixture of rich characterisation, painful emotion and sudden moments of quirky humour. The play sprawls a bit aimlessly at times, but builds to a blistering climax.
Barbican 3 Pit Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

D. Murder by Misadventure

Traditional thriller involving our old friend, 'the perfect murder'. This time it is Gerald Harper and William Gaunt who play the crime-writing partnership intent on killing each other, and though its all rather familiar stuff; the twists and turns are handled with ingenuity.
Whitehall Theatre, London SW1 (0207 867 1119)

E. The Alchemist

London impresarios looking for a hit should board the next train to Scarborough.

One of my favourite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zcaland's South Island which I came across by chance when I was climbing. We had been flown up to near the top of a glacier and had climbed to the peak and then had to walk all the way down. When we finally reached the bottom, to my astonishment, there was this hotel.

The hotel isn't small and there are plenty of takers for the free watersports, but you can easily escape from all the other people along nine kilometres of private beach; you have only to swim a few yards out into the Indian Ocean and you can barely see the hotel for palm trees. Sit on the beach in the evening when everyone has gone and as the light drains from the sky you'll feel far away from everything.

The Hermitage Hotel is on New Zealand's South Island. It is one of my favourite hotels. I found it when I was climbing. We flew to the top of a glacier, climbed to the top of the mountain, and then walked all the way down. When we got to the bottom, I was very surprised to see a hotel. It was alone in very beautiful countryside. After the hard climb, it was amazing to find this very comfortable hotel with a man playing the piano.

The Paradis Hotel is in the south-west of Mauritius. It is on its own piece of land, in a very quiet part of the island. If you drive from the hotel, the road goes next to the coast and past empty beaches. The hotel is big and many people use the free water sports. But you can be alone on the long private beach. If you swim a short way into the sea, you can hardly see the hotel because of the trees. Sit on the beach in the evening when everyone has gone. As it gets dark, you will feel very far from everything.

The Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island is one of my favourite hotels, which I discovered by chance while climbing. We had been flown close to the top of a glacier, climbed to the summit, and then had to walk all the way down. When we finally reached the bottom, I was amazed to find this hotel. It stood alone in incredibly beautiful, wild countryside at a high altitude. After coming down the mountain, exhausted and injured, it was extraordinary to find such a luxurious place, complete with a man playing Cole Porter on the piano.

Although the hotel is large and many guests participate in the free watersports, you can easily escape the crowds along nine kilometres of private beach. If you swim just a short distance into the Indian Ocean, the hotel becomes almost invisible behind the palm trees. Sitting on the beach in the evening after everyone has left, watching the light fade from the sky, you'll feel completely removed from the world.

The hotel even maintains apartments for those who choose to settle in for several months. Its spacious grounds and scattered buildings are arranged across Nairobi Hill, providing a peaceful retreat from the city's noise.

204,"Life was getting out of hand

Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and rediscovers the joys of manual labour.

Everyone is in love with technology. It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK.
These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment.
However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor -
a PS48 call-out fee, a labour charge of PS15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.
This makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us.
So when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost.
I am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go.
Of course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were becoming too apt to collapse in front of the television, or slot in a video, I sent back the rented colour equipment and we returned to the small black-and-white portable.
It is a real strain on the eyes and concentrates the mind on what is really worth watching. We now spend a lot more time walking the dog (who never liked television anyway), reading, talking or pursuing other hobbies.
One of these, in my own case, is sewing; and here is another gadget that went by the board. My old Singer sewing machine is now an ornamental plant table, and as l cannot afford to replace it, I have taken to sewing by hand.
We have come to believe that we could not do without it, and if we do resist the notion that our lives would be unmanageable without the appliances of science we certainly do not want to relinquish them. Pity the generations whose lives were blighted by tedious and blister inducing toil. Even our brains are relieved of exertion by computers that not only perform miraculous calculations with amazing speed but now provide entertainment.
In fact, the time I now spend placidly stitching is anything but tedious, and the advantages are numerous. For a start, I can sew and listen to the radio - another rediscovered pleasure - or I can talk with family and friends. If it is a simple task, I can watch the programmes I do want to see on television, and alleviate my puritanical guilt at sitting in front of the box by doing something useful at the same time. And what a lovely, cosy feeling it is to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea for company.
Quite wrongly, I had tended to think with horror of the women who sewed elaborate garments, robes, linen and household items by hand. I thought of those long hours, the strain on the eyes and so on. 
There is a wonderfully soothing quality about executing a craft by hand, a great satisfaction in watching one's work become neater, more assured. I find things get done surprisingly quickly, and the pace of life suddenly slows down to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also freed from one of the most detestable aspects of late 20th century life the need to rush to finish an activity so that I can rush to the next.
Meanwhile I have regained control of my sink, where I plunge my hands into the suds and daydream while doing the washing up agreeable, if temporarily forgotten, activity.
The result of all this brooding is that I now prowl the house with a speculative eye. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave oven, that powered lawnmower? Come to think of it, we could save an awful lot of money by doing without electric lights!",C1,,"Life was becoming too busy.

Susan Harr stops using her machines and finds the happiness of working with her hands.

Everyone likes technology. It gives us wonderful machines that make life easy and give us more time for other things. We are told that technology is very important and that this is good.

But there are clear problems. When I use my hands, I don't use any electricity. Making things by hand does not make the environment dirty.

Recently, my computer broke. I had to pay a lot of money to fix it. This made me think that machines are often not worth the money or the problems. Do we need technology as much as we think? Slowly, I have stopped using machines in my house when they break.

This makes me ask: what 'time' does technology give us? Time to do more things, so we have to buy more machines? If that is true, then the people who sell things are very clever, but I think they are tricking us.

So when my machine started making strange noises, I stopped using it. I put it outside.

Now I am not stuck to a loud machine. I can take my time with my sewing. I was always a little scared of those fast electric machines. The best thing is, I can put everything in a bag and take it with me anywhere.

Of course, there are some machines I still want. I lived for a year without a washing machine, and I learned that it is very useful. But there are other machines I am happy to live without. I felt we were watching television too much, so I sent the big colour TV back. Now we have a small black and white one.

It is hard on the eyes, so we only watch what is really good. Now we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing other hobbies.

One of my hobbies is sewing. I stopped using my old sewing machine. Now it is a table for a plant. I cannot buy a new one, so I sew by hand.

We think we cannot live without machines. We do not want to give them up. We feel sorry for people in the past who had to do hard, boring work. Now, computers do difficult work for us and give us fun.

But the time I spend sewing is not boring at all. There are many good things about it. I can sew and listen to the radio - which I enjoy again - or I can talk with my family and friends. If the sewing is easy, I can watch a good programme on TV. I don't feel lazy because I am doing something useful. It is a nice, comfortable feeling to sit by the fire and sew, with a cup of tea.

I used to think it was terrible that women in the past sewed everything by hand. I thought about the long hours and how it hurt their eyes.

But I was wrong. There is a very calm feeling when you make something by hand. It feels good to see your work get better and neater. I am surprised how quickly I finish things. My life slows down to the speed of my own hands. I am also free from a bad part of modern life: the need to hurry to finish one thing so I can hurry to the next thing.

Now I also enjoy washing dishes by hand. I put my hands in the soapy water and daydream. It is a nice activity that I had forgotten.

Because of all this thinking, I now look around my house. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave, or the electric lawnmower? I think we could save a lot of money if we didn't use electric lights","Life was becoming too busy and complicated.

Susan Harr stops using her electronic devices and finds the happiness of doing things by hand.

Everyone loves technology. It gives us amazing gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. We have slowly been made to believe that technology is the most important thing and that this is fine.

The results are clear. When I use my hands, I don't use any electricity. Doing a craft by hand does not harm the environment.

But a recent bad experience with my broken word processor made me think gadgets are often not worth the money or the problems. It cost a lot to fix. Are we as dependent on technology as we think? Little by little, I have stopped replacing my household gadgets when they break.

This makes me ask what 'time' technology really gives us. Time to do more activities for which we need to buy more gadgets? If that is true, then the marketing experts are very clever, but I think they are tricking us.

So when my machine started making strange noises, I stopped using it. I left it in the backyard.

I felt we were watching television too much, so I sent back the rented colour TV. We now use a small black-and-white one instead.

It is hard on the eyes, so it makes us think about what is really worth watching. We now spend much more time walking the dog (who never liked TV anyway), reading, talking, or doing other hobbies.

One of my hobbies is sewing, and I stopped using another gadget for this. My old sewing machine is now a table for a plant. Because I can't afford a new one, I have started sewing by hand.

We have started to believe we cannot live without technology. We think our lives would be too difficult without these machines. We feel sorry for people in the past who had to do long, hard work. Even our brains can rest because computers do difficult work and provide fun.

In fact, the time I spend sewing calmly is not boring at all, and there are many good things about it. First, I can sew and listen to the radio - another pleasure I found again - or I can talk with my family and friends. If the sewing is easy, I can watch the TV programmes I really want to see. I feel less guilty about watching TV because I am doing something useful at the same time. It is a lovely, comfortable feeling to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea.

I used to think, wrongly, that women who sewed everything by hand had a terrible life. I thought about the long hours and the strain on their eyes.

But there is a wonderfully calming quality about doing a craft by hand. It is very satisfying to see your work become neater and better. I find that things get done quite quickly, and the speed of my life slows down to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also free from one of the worst parts of modern life: the need to hurry to finish one thing so I can rush to the next.

At the same time, I have control of my kitchen sink again. I put my hands in the soapy water and daydream while I wash the dishes. It is a pleasant activity that I had almost forgotten.

Because of all this thinking, I now look around my house and wonder. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave oven, or that electric lawnmower? Now that I think about it, we could save a lot of money if we didn't use electric lights","Life was becoming unmanageable.

Susan Harr unplugs her devices and rediscovers the satisfaction of doing things by hand.

Everyone is fascinated by technology. It provides us with incredible gadgets that simplify our lives and supposedly give us more free time. A gradual but powerful influence has convinced us that technology is essential and that this situation is acceptable.

The consequences are clear. Using my hands requires no electricity, which our society consumes excessively. Creating something by hand does not damage the environment.

However, a recent frustrating experience with my broken word processor – an expensive repair bill – confirmed my suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the cost or the hassle. Are we truly as dependent on technology as we believe? Gradually, I have allowed household appliances to remain broken when they reach the end of their short lifespans.

This makes me question what 'time' technology actually provides. Is it time to take up more activities that require us to purchase even more gadgets? If that is the case, then the marketing experts deserve credit, but I believe they are deceiving us.

So when the device started making odd noises, which continued even after a confused technician examined it, I left it in the backyard, where it now quietly murmurs to itself.

I am no longer tied to a loud, whirring machine, bent over with my back to the world. I can take my time with my sewing. In any case, I was always slightly nervous about those electric machines that speed towards your fingers. Most importantly, I can put everything into a bag and take it with me anywhere I go.

Naturally, there are some devices I would not want to live without. A year without a washing machine convinced me of its value. But there are others whose absence has brought unexpected pleasure. Concerned that we were spending too much time in front of the television, I returned the rented colour TV and we went back to using a small black-and-white portable.

It is difficult to watch for long, but it makes us focus on what is truly worth viewing. We now spend far more time walking the dog (who never enjoyed television), reading, talking, or doing other hobbies.

One of my hobbies is sewing, and this is another gadget I have stopped using. My old sewing machine now serves as a plant stand, and since I cannot afford a new one, I have started sewing by hand.

We have come to believe we cannot manage without technology, and even if we doubt that our lives would be impossible without these appliances, we certainly do not wish to give them up. We feel sorry for past generations whose lives were filled with difficult, boring work. Even our minds are spared effort by computers that perform complex tasks and provide entertainment.

In reality, the time I now spend sewing calmly is far from boring, and it has many benefits. To begin with, I can sew and listen to the radio – another pleasure I have rediscovered – or I can chat with family and friends. If the sewing is simple, I can watch the television programmes I genuinely want to see, and I feel less guilty about watching TV because I am being productive at the same time. It is a wonderfully comfortable feeling to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea nearby.

I used to think, mistakenly, with horror about the women who sewed detailed clothing and household items by hand. I imagined the long hours and the strain on their eyes.

There is a wonderfully calming quality about creating something by hand, and a deep satisfaction in seeing your work become neater and more skillful. I am surprised by how quickly things get done, and the pace of life slows down to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also free from one of the most unpleasant aspects of modern life: the constant pressure to finish one task quickly so I can hurry on to the next.

Meanwhile, I have regained control of my kitchen sink, where I plunge my hands into the soapy water and let my mind wander while washing the dishes – a pleasant, if somewhat forgotten, activity.

As a result of all this reflection, I now look around my house with a critical eye. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave, or that electric lawnmower? Now that I consider it, we could save a significant amount of money by managing without electric lights",,
205,"Ordinary people, ordinary lives

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like, the sort of people they were in their youth? The glimpses rare diaries give us are frustratingly incomplete, family anecdotes only half remembered. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional.
Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies, producing a hardback book of at least 20,000 words -- with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.
The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. 
""When I started I didn't take it nearly so seriously as I do now, having met people who genuinely will talk and have led interesting lives,"" she says. ""They would say they are doing it for their children or for posterity, but they are getting quite a lot out of it themselves. They enjoy doing it.""
The assurance of confidentiality encourages her subjects to overcome any instinct of self-censorship. 
""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost one fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were things that hurt, like my divorce, and the pain was still there.""
""I did it for my family, so that perhaps they could learn something, but I have not yet let my children - who are in their thirties - read it. They were hurt by things in my life and there are a lot of details which I don't feel I want them to know at the moment. If they insist, I'll let them. But I think I'd rather they read it after I was dead.""
He also recognised patterns laid down in childhood, which showed themselves in repeatedly making the same mistakes. It is something Ms Renier has detected in other people. ""It's amazing how many people really have been conditioned by their parents,"" she says. ""The injunctions and encouragements that were laid down in childhood have effects for the rest of their lives. They become caught in repeating patterns of behaviour. They marry the sort of people of whom their parents approved -- or go in the opposite direction as a sort of rebellion.""
""A lot of disappointments come out. Sixty years later they still are regretting or resenting things that were never resolved with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had hang-ups in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They live their lives in an attempt to impress a parent who wasn't impressed and if that fails some of them seem to be seeking permission to say 'I can't stand my mother'.""
Recorder rather than inquisitor, Ms Renier keeps her distance. ""It's not for public consumption and I'm not there as a very nosy person. People have got carried away and told me something, then said, 'I'm not sure if that ought to go in'. I put it in anyway - they can remove things when they see the draft. But generally people want to be honest, warts and all.""
""It's not vanity publishing, it's not people saying 'Gosh, I've had such an interesting life the world's got to know about it.' Things are moving much faster than at any time in history and we are losing sight of what happened in the past. It's a way of giving roots. We need some sort of link to our ancestors because people don't sit around in an extended family any more. People want a little immortality.""
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: choose your own colour of library buckram, pick your own title.
Fascinating to the private audience at which each book is aimed, the results are obviously not of the dirt-at-any-cost school of life story. Ms Renier organises her material logically and writes well, the final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each. She receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost - inevitable with the time involved -- clearly deters many people.
""I thought it would be a more downmarket product than it is,"" she says. ""But the people I've done have all been county types, readers of Harpers & Queen, which is one of the magazines where I advertise. They're the sort of people who at one time would have had their portraits painted to leave to their descendants.""",C1,,"Most of us have photos of our grandparents. But do we know about their lives? Do we know what they were like when they were young? Old diaries tell us only a little. Family stories are often not remembered well. What will our grandchildren know about us? We plan to write about our lives, but we never do. We may leave videos, but they do not show everything.

Hannah Renier has an answer. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words. You can add pictures too. She writes about everyday people, not famous ones.

She first had this idea when she talked to her family. She saw that family history was being lost.

""At first, I did not think this work was very important,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have had interesting lives. They like to talk. They say they are doing it for their children or for the future. But they also enjoy it for themselves.""

People feel safe telling her everything. They do not hide things.

A 62-year-old man told her, ""I felt I could tell the truth. Some things I said were sad, like my divorce. I still feel sad about it.""

""I did it for my family, so they could learn from my life,"" he said. ""But my children are adults, and I have not let them read it yet. Some parts of my life hurt them. There are many things I do not want them to know now. If they really want to read it, I will let them. But I think I want them to read it after I die.""

He also saw that he made the same mistakes many times. Ms. Renier sees this in other people too.

""Many people are still influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things their parents said or did when they were children affect them for their whole lives. They often marry the kind of person their parents like. Or sometimes they do the opposite, to be different.""

""Many people talk about things that make them sad. After 60 years, they still feel bad about problems with their parents. There is no age when these feelings stop. If people had problems when they were young, they often still have them when they are older. They try to make a parent proud, but sometimes it does not work.""

Ms. Renier listens but does not tell people what to do. ""The book is not for everyone. I am not there to be too curious. Sometimes people tell me something and then say, 'Maybe do not put that in the book.' But I write it down. They can take it out later when they see the first writing. Most people want to tell the true story, with the good parts and the bad parts.""

""This is not about saying 'look how great I am.' Life changes very fast now. We are forgetting the past. This is a way to remember our family. We need a link to our family from before. People do not live with their big families anymore. They want their family to remember them.""

Ms. Renier records about 30 hours of talking with each person. She uses this to write the life story. She puts the events in order. She uses a computer to make the book. You can choose the color of the cover and the title.

The books are interesting for the family. They do not tell bad secrets. Ms. Renier writes the stories in a clear way. The final book is nice because the person's life is interesting. The book does not look cheap. It costs almost £3,000. Extra copies cost £25 each. About 10 people ask about it every week, but the high price stops many people.

""I thought more normal people would want this,"" she says. ""But the people I work for are all quite rich. They read magazines like Harpers & Queen, where I put my ad. They are the kind of people who, long ago, would have a painting made of themselves to give to their family.""","Most of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were really like? Diaries don't tell us everything, and family stories are often forgotten. What will our grandchildren know about us? We plan to write about our lives, but we never do it. We might leave videos, but they still don't show everything.

Hannah Renier has a solution: she writes life stories for other people. She makes a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if they want. It's not for famous people, but for ordinary people.

She had the idea when she talked to her family and saw that family history was being lost.

""When I started, I didn't think it was so important,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have interesting lives and like to talk. They say they are doing it for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it themselves.""

People feel safe to be honest because she keeps their stories private.

A 62-year-old man said, ""I felt I could be honest. I was surprised by what I said. Some things still hurt, like my divorce.""

""I did it for my family, so they could learn from my life,"" he added. ""But my children, who are in their thirties, haven't read it yet. Some parts of my life hurt them, and there are details I don't want them to know now. If they really want to read it, I'll let them. But I think I'd prefer they read it after I die.""

He also saw that he kept making the same mistakes, patterns that started when he was a child. Ms. Renier sees this in other people too.

""It's amazing how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""Things their parents said or did when they were young affect them for their whole lives. They often marry the kind of person their parents would like—or sometimes the opposite, to rebel.""

""Many people talk about disappointments. Even after sixty years, they still feel sad or angry about problems with their parents that were never solved. If people had problems when they were young, they often still have them when they are older. They try to make a parent proud, and if it doesn't work, some just want to say, 'I can't stand my mother.'""

Ms. Renier listens but doesn't push people to talk. ""I'm not being nosy,"" she says. ""Sometimes people tell me something and then say, 'Maybe don't put that in.' But I write it down anyway—they can take it out later when they see the draft. Most people want to tell the truth, even the bad parts.""

""This isn't about showing off. People don't say, 'My life is so interesting, everyone should know.' Life is changing fast, and we are forgetting the past. This is a way to remember where we come from. We need a connection to our family history because families don't live close together anymore. People want to be remembered.""

She records about 30 hours of conversation with each person. She uses this to write the life story, changing the order of events to make it clear. With modern technology, she can make the whole book except the hard cover. People can choose the cover colour and the title.

The books are interesting for the family who read them, but they are not full of secrets. Ms. Renier organizes the stories well and writes clearly. The final book looks good—not cheap. It costs almost £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. About ten people ask about it each week, but the price is too high for many.

""I thought more ordinary people would want this,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are all quite well-off, the kind who read Harpers & Queen magazine, where I advertise. They are the sort of people who, in the past, would have had a painting made to leave to their family.""",,,
206,"WEATHERVANE MAKER

THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill, going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham's designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. 'That way I can produce a unique personalised item,' he explains. 'A lot of my customers are women buying presents for their husbands. They want a distinctive gift that represents the man's business or leisure interests.'
It's all a far cry from the traditional cockerel, the most common design for weathervanes.
It was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick that featured on the first weathervane Graham ever made. Friends admired his surprise present for his wife and began asking him to make vanes for them. 'I realised that when it came to subjects that could be made into them, the possibilities were limitless,' he says.
Graham decided to concentrate his efforts on a weathervane business. He had sewed an apprenticeship as a precision engineer and had worked in that trade for 15 years when he and his wife, Liz, agreed to swap roles - she went out to work as an architectural assistant and he stayed at home to look after the children and build up the business.
That was five years ago and he has no regrets about his new direction. 'My previous work didn't have an artistic element to it, whereas this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I really enjoy the design side.'
Graham has now perfected over 100 original designs. He works to very fine detail, always seeking approval for the design of the silhouette from the customer before proceeding with the hand-cutting.
Graham also keeps plenty of traditional designs in stock, since they prove as popular as the one-offs. 'It seems that people are attracted to hand-crafting,' Graham says. 'They welcome the opportunity to acquire something a little bit different.'
Graham has no plans for expansion, as he wants to keep the business as a rural craft.
'I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality and I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a nondescript shape turn into something almost lifelike,' he says.
'For centuries, weathervanes have kept communities in touch with the elements signalling those shifts in wind direction that bring about changes in the weather,' he explains.
'And nowadays, with more and more people moving to the country, individuals want to put an exclusive finishing touch to their properties. It has been a boost to crafts like mine.'
Graham has become increasingly busy, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide.
American and Danish buyers in particular are showing interest. 'Pricing,' he explains, 'depends on the intricacy of the design.' His most recent request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a gift with a difference.",C1,,"A person who makes weathervanes

Making weathervanes is a very old skill. It started a long time ago in Egypt. Today, this work is still done in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who cuts weathervanes by hand. Graham makes each design for one person. He makes it just for them. ""This way I can make a special, one-of-a-kind thing,"" he says. ""Many of my customers are women. They buy presents for their husbands. They want a special gift that shows the man's job or hobby.""

This is very different from the old weathervane with a cockerel on it.

The first weathervane Graham made was not a cockerel. It was a witch on a broomstick. It was a surprise gift for his wife. His friends saw it and liked it. They asked him to make weathervanes for them. ""I saw that you can make a weathervane of almost anything,"" he says.

Graham decided to start a weathervane business. Before this, he was a different kind of engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed jobs. She went to work, and he stayed home. He looked after the children and started his business.

That was five years ago. He is happy with his new work. ""My old job was not about art. This job is fun and creative,"" he says. ""I really like designing the weathervanes.""

Graham has now made more than 100 different designs. He works very carefully. He always shows the customer the design first. He only starts cutting when they say yes.

Graham also has many traditional designs ready to buy. People like these as much as the special ones. ""It seems people like things made by hand,"" Graham says. ""They like to have something a little different.""

Graham does not want to make his business bigger. He wants it to stay a small country craft.

""I have found the right work for me. People love that each piece is special. I feel very happy when a simple shape becomes a beautiful object,"" he says.

""For a long time, weathervanes have shown people which way the wind is blowing. This tells them if the weather will change,"" he explains.

""Now, more people are moving to the country. They want something special for their homes. This is good for my work.""

Graham is very busy. He sends weathervanes in boxes to people all over the world.

People from America and Denmark are very interested. ""The price changes,"" he says. ""It depends on how difficult the design is."" His last order was for a dog with curly hair. For any reason, Graham can make a special and different gift.","Weathervane Maker

Making weathervanes is a very old skill that started in ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still popular in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates each design himself to match what his customers want. ""This way I can make a special, personal item,"" he says. ""Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a unique present that shows the man's job or hobby.""

This is very different from the traditional rooster, which is the most common weathervane design.

The first weathervane Graham made was not a rooster, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked this surprise gift for his wife and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I saw that you could make a weathervane of almost anything,"" he says.

That was five years ago, and he is happy with his new job. ""My old work wasn't artistic, but this is exciting and creative,"" he says. ""I really like designing.""

Graham has now made more than 100 different designs. He pays close attention to detail and always shows the customer the design before he starts cutting it by hand.

Graham also has many traditional designs ready to sell, because they are as popular as the special orders. ""People seem to like things made by hand,"" Graham says. ""They like having something a little unusual.""

Graham does not want to make his business bigger. He wants it to stay a small, country craft.

""I have found my place. People love that each piece is unique, and I enjoy seeing a simple shape become something that looks real,"" he says.

""For hundreds of years, weathervanes have helped people know the wind direction, which tells them about weather changes,"" he explains.

""Now, as more people move to the countryside, they want something special for their homes. This has been good for crafts like mine.""

Graham is getting busier, sending weathervanes in flat boxes to customers all over the world.

Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he says. His latest order was for a dog with curly hair. Whatever the event, Graham can make a gift that is not like any other.","WEATHERVANE MAKER

The creation of weathervanes is an ancient craft that dates back to the time of the early Egyptians. Today, this tradition continues in the workshop established by Graham Smith. He belongs to a small group of people in the country who produce hand-cut weathervanes. Graham develops individual designs that are customized according to his clients' specific needs. ""In this way, I can create a unique, personalized item,"" he explains. ""Many of my customers are women purchasing gifts for their husbands. They are looking for a distinctive present that reflects the man's profession or personal interests.""

This contrasts sharply with the traditional rooster, which remains the most familiar weathervane design.

Graham's first weathervane was not a rooster but a witch riding a broomstick. After his friends admired this unexpected gift for his wife, they began requesting him to produce weathervanes for them. ""I discovered that the range of possible subjects for these creations was practically endless,"" he remarks.

Graham made the decision to focus on developing a weathervane business. Having completed an apprenticeship as a precision engineer, he had worked in that industry for fifteen years before he and his wife, Liz, agreed to exchange roles. She began working as an architectural assistant while he remained at home to care for their children and establish the business.

That was five years ago, and he feels no regret about his change in career. ""My previous profession lacked any artistic aspect, whereas this work is both exciting and creative,"" he states. ""I particularly enjoy the design process.""

To date, Graham has perfected more than one hundred original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always obtains the customer's approval for the design outline before starting the hand-cutting process.

Graham also stocks numerous traditional designs, as they remain as popular as the custom-made pieces. ""It appears that people are drawn to handcrafted products,"" Graham observes. ""They appreciate the chance to obtain something that is slightly out of the ordinary.""

Graham has no intention of expanding his business, as he wishes to maintain it as a rural craft.

""I have discovered my niche in the market. Customers value the individuality of the products, and I gain enormous satisfaction from watching a plain shape transform into something that appears almost lifelike,"" he comments.

""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities stay aware of the weather by indicating shifts in wind direction that signal changes in the climate,"" he explains.

""Nowadays, with increasing numbers of people relocating to the countryside, individuals desire to add an exclusive final detail to their properties. This has provided a welcome boost to crafts such as mine.""

Graham has been growing progressively busier, supplying flat-pack weathervanes to clients across the globe.

Buyers from the United States and Denmark have shown particular interest. ""The cost is determined by the complexity of the design,"" he clarifies. His most recent commission was for a dog with a curly coat. Whatever the event, Graham is able to produce a truly distinctive gift.",,

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who discuss their different professions: the highlights, the drawbacks and their typical working day.

ANNE'S DAY

""I get up at 6.30am, go the gym at 7am, get to work by 8am and start operating at 8.30am. I operate all Monday and Wednesday, as well as some Friday afternoons. Most standard head operations take three hours, but some operations take all day. I've worked ten hours straight through on occasion without eating or going to the loo.
Deciding when to operate, and what to do, can be stressful. I don't feel particularly stressed when operating, but sometimes I worry about what I'm going to do the next day. Brain surgery tends to be a last resort for a patient, but when it works it's tremendous, and more than makes up for the unsuccessful times. From 10am to 1pm I hold an out-patients' clinic, when I explain the operations. I enjoy this and find it quite easy to talk to the patients. If they get upset, I comfort them, but time pressure can make this difficult.
I leave work between 6pm and 8pm. Some nights and weekends I'm on call, and I always carry my bleeper. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about the people I've left behind, and at night I dream I'm operating. I'm hopeless at switching off.""

B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER

Name: Marita

Age: 31

MARITA'S DAY

""I get up at Z45am, leave the house by 8.20am, take the train to work and arrive at 9.15am. At 10.30am on Monday we meet to discuss what were doing, any problems or whether anyone needs help. We work in teams - in my team there are three senior designers, a company partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. The work usually involves ten to fifteen per cent design: the rest is production. I'll be given a brief by the client - with luck the company will have clear ideas about what they want to say, their target market and the form of the project. I then spend three or four weeks designing, researching and developing the project.
After this I present my ideas to the client and once they've agreed to them, we work out estimates and budgets, and I start commissioning photographers and illustrators. I liaise with the printers and make sure the needs of the job are being met, and on time. I spend a lot of time managing people. I have to be able to communicate with a broad range of people, and briefing them correctly is essential. When their work comes in, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Keeping several jobs going at once can send stress levels sky-high. Deadlines are always looming, and no day has a set structure.
Lunch is at 1pm for an hour, when we try to get out to the pub. Otherwise I have sandwiches and work through. It's a great feeling if the client gives a good response to the designs you've done and you know the project has worked; it's a great disappointment when you've worked really hard and the job gets rejected. I get home at 7.30pm at the earliest; often it's 8.30pm and sometimes much later. I find it hard to unwind when I get back, especially if I'm very busy.""

At 10.30 or 11am I might go for a bike ride, or swim. Because chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I have to watch my diet and exercise quite carefully. I usually have a big breakfast, though, and just have snacks during the day. People often ask me to recommend restaurants, nightclubs or shops, so I have to know my way around. Luckily, a lot of the jobs are pre-booked, so I get a chance to look routes up beforehand. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are anti-social, some arrogant, some downright rude. But most of the time people are very well behaved and I've built up a good rapport with my regular clients.
There are times when I hear a conversation in the car and have to make sure my eyes are firmly on the road and my ears shut. Sometimes the press have tried to make me talk about clients I've carried, but I won't. I work a seven-day week, up to fifteen hours a day. I have to be careful not to get too tired.

""I get up at about 7am, leave the house at 7.30am and get to my first job. My assistant and I spend most of our time maintaining gardens we originally designed and landscaped. We do a few commercial jobs but most of our work is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At about 11am we get hungry and go to a local cafe for a big breakfast. I often look at my watch and wish it was earlier and that time didn't pass so quickly. In summer I may work until 10pm; in winter until 4.30pm.
The business office is at home, so when I get back I listen to any messages and respond to any calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I'll usually arrange a consultation with them in the evening - at about 7pm or 8pm. We specialise in using old materials, such as old bricks and unusual plants, to make gardens look as if they were built a long time ago. But sometimes people have a set idea of what they want, and it can be pretty horrible. Still, its very satisfying when we do a complete landscape from start to finish and then see all the blooms come out.
It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business line when it rings. I never have any trouble sleeping because the work I do is so physical that I'm always exhausted at the end of the day. I wouldn't say I'm very strong, but I'm fit.

I check that the contractors are working to the schedule and specifications, with correct safety systems and minimum environmental impact. I help to co-ordinate the site professionals and find solutions to any problems.
The contractors start work at 6am, so my first task is to find out from the clerk of works what's been going on since I left the night before. The rest of the day is a reaction to whatever he tells me. Usually there's some paperwork from the contractors to look at, or there might be design queries to answer.
Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2pm and 2.30pm, but I tend to grab things to eat as I go along. The contractors have set mealtimes and when they're off eating it's easier to check things on site. Because we're checking their work it can cause conflict, so our relationship has to be as open as possible. I see the duty resident engineer once a day. However, if something really important comes up I don't wait to tell them before I act. I usually leave the site at about 6pm and Im on call all the time.",C1,,,"**Take Five Careers**

The builders have fixed times for meals, and when they are eating, it is easier for me to check things on the site. Because we are checking their work, it can sometimes cause arguments, so we need to have a very honest relationship. I see the main engineer once a day. But if something very important happens, I don't wait to tell them before I act. I usually leave the site at about 6 pm, and I am always on call if they need me.","Take Five Careers

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who describe their various careers: the positive aspects, the challenges, and their daily routines.

A. THE BRAIN SURGEON

Name: Anne

Age: 34

ANNE'S DAY

""I wake up at 6.30am, go to the gym at 7am, and arrive at work by 8am. I begin surgery at 8.30am. I operate throughout Mondays and Wednesdays, and occasionally on Friday afternoons. Most standard brain operations last about three hours, but some can take an entire day. I have occasionally worked for ten hours continuously without eating or taking a break.
Making decisions about when to operate and what procedure to perform can be stressful. I don't feel particularly stressed during surgery itself, but I sometimes worry about the following day's operations. Brain surgery is typically a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, the results are extraordinary and compensate for the unsuccessful cases. From 10am to 1pm, I run an outpatients' clinic where I explain surgical procedures to patients. I enjoy this part of my job and find it relatively easy to communicate with patients. When they become distressed, I comfort them, though time constraints can make this challenging.
I finish work between 6pm and 8pm. Some evenings and weekends I'm on call, and I always carry my pager. During holidays, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and at night I sometimes dream about performing surgery. I find it extremely difficult to stop thinking about work.""

B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER

Name: Marita

Age: 31

MARITA'S DAY

""I get up at 7.45am, leave home by 8.20am, take the train to work, and arrive at 9.15am. At 10.30am on Mondays we hold meetings to discuss our current projects, any issues, and whether anyone requires assistance. We work in teams - mine consists of three senior designers, a company partner who supervises everything, and a junior designer. Only about ten to fifteen percent of my work involves actual design; the remainder concerns production. Clients provide me with a brief - ideally, the company has clear objectives regarding their message, target audience, and project format. I then spend three to four weeks designing, researching, and developing the project.
After this period, I present my concepts to the client. Once they approve them, we calculate estimates and budgets, and I begin hiring photographers and illustrators. I coordinate with printers and ensure that project requirements are met on schedule. I devote considerable time to managing people. I need to communicate effectively with diverse individuals, and providing them with accurate briefs is crucial. When their work arrives, I assemble all elements and send them to the printers. Managing multiple projects simultaneously can become extremely stressful. Deadlines are constantly approaching, and no two days follow the same structure.
Lunch occurs at 1pm for one hour, when we attempt to visit a pub. Otherwise, I eat sandwiches at my desk while working. It's incredibly satisfying when clients respond positively to my designs and the project proves successful; it's deeply disappointing when extensive effort leads to rejection. I return home by 7.30pm at the earliest; frequently it's 8.30pm or later. I struggle to relax when I get home, particularly during busy periods.""

C. THE CHAUFFEUR

Name: Linda

Age: 42

LINDA'S DAY

""I typically wake up around 7am, though two or three mornings weekly I collect passengers from long-haul flights at Heathrow or Gatwick, requiring me to rise between 4.30am and 5am. Around 10.30 or 11am I might go cycling or swimming. Since chauffeuring involves prolonged sitting, I must monitor my diet and maintain a regular exercise routine. I generally have a substantial breakfast followed by snacks during the day. Clients frequently request restaurant, nightclub, or shop recommendations, so I need thorough knowledge of the area. Fortunately, many assignments are pre-booked, allowing me to research routes in advance. Not all passengers behave politely. Some are antisocial, others arrogant, and some frankly rude. However, most people conduct themselves appropriately, and I've established excellent relationships with regular clients.
There are occasions when I overhear conversations in the vehicle and must concentrate exclusively on the road while ignoring what I hear. Journalists have occasionally pressured me to discuss clients I've transported, but I consistently refuse. I work seven days per week, sometimes up to fifteen hours daily. I must guard against excessive fatigue. I aim to be in bed by 11pm.""

D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER

Name: Tracy

Age: 27

TRACY'S DAY

""I rise around 7am, depart home at 7.30am, and proceed to my first appointment. My assistant and I primarily maintain gardens that we originally designed and constructed. We undertake some commercial projects, but most work involves private gardens. We spend approximately ninety minutes at each property. Around 11am we become hungry and visit a local café for a large breakfast. I often check my watch wishing time would pass more slowly. During summer I might work until 10pm; in winter until approximately 4.30pm.
My business office is located at home, so upon returning I listen to messages and respond to calls. When clients want garden landscaping, I typically schedule evening consultations around 7pm or 8pm. We specialize in using traditional materials like antique bricks and unusual plants to create gardens that appear historically established. Occasionally clients have fixed ideas that may not be aesthetically pleasing. Nevertheless, it's immensely satisfying to complete an entire landscape project and subsequently observe the flowering results.
Evening relaxation proves difficult because I always hear the business phone ringing. I never experience sleep problems because the physical nature of my work leaves me exhausted by day's end. I wouldn't describe myself as particularly strong, but I maintain good fitness. While physically demanding, the profession allows considerable creative freedom.""

E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER

Name: Zena

Age: 27

ZENA'S DAY

""I reach the construction site by 8.30am. As assistant resident engineer, I supervise the construction of several bridges and a retaining wall designed to prevent vehicles leaving the road and entering a quarry. I verify that contractors adhere to schedules and specifications, implement proper safety systems, and minimize environmental impact. I help coordinate site professionals and develop solutions to emerging problems.
Since contractors commence work at 6am, my initial task involves consulting the clerk of works about developments since my previous departure. The remainder of my day responds to whatever information he provides. Typically I review contractor documentation or address design-related queries.
Lunch normally lasts thirty minutes between 2pm and 2.30pm, though I often eat while working. Contractors have scheduled meal breaks when site inspection becomes easier. Since we monitor their work, potential conflicts arise, necessitating completely transparent relationships. I meet the duty resident engineer daily. However, when critical situations develop, I take immediate action without waiting for consultation. I usually depart around 6pm and remain on permanent call.",,

Yvonne Coppard

Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game -- surveillance of a suspicious bookshop -- when she realises that one of its rare customers is her
Uncle Jim.
He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime, manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends, whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard.
When Emma finds her life in danger, things take a dark and compelling turn - her confinement in the cellar of a derelict house is stunningly handled.
This book reveals the minutiae of family life, the bonds of childhood friendship and warns that adults aren't always the protectors they ought to be. A vital and convincing read.

Backtrack

Peter Hunt

Two teenagers, 'peasant' Jack and Rill, a boarder at a posh girls school, join forces on realising that relatives of both were involved in an apparently inexplicable 1915 train accident, in which eight people died. Varied viewpoints and documents -- maps, first-hand accounts, hurt records, railway histories -- throw an ever-changing light on the incident, so that the reader works as hard as the two protagonists to understand what happened and why. A clever, complex novel which rewards close attention.

Pigeon Summer

Ann Turnbull

Mary Dyer doesn't really fit into her family or male-dominated culture; for one thing, she, a girl, loves her father's racing pigeons and when he must go away to find work, Mary knows enough to carry on managing the loft and winning prizes, despite increasing conflict with her harassed mother. Set believably in 1930, this readable tale has a sound basic message that 'There are different kinds of cleverness', which can't be bad. Thoughtful readers should find satisfaction here.

Yaxley's Cat

Robert Westall

Unusually, Robert Westall uses the viewpoint of a mature woman for this chilling story of rural prejudice and persecution. Rose, to escape from her materialistic life and her smug husband, rents Sepp Yaxley's cottage with her two children. A ferocious cat, and bizarre items found in cupboards, reveal the answer to why Yaxley disappeared, but the newcomers' presence arouses local hostility to the point where their own lives are at risk. By the end, the threatening violence is controlled, but Rose feels just as dismayed by the methodical ruthlessness of her teenage son. Utterly gripping.

Someone's Mother is Missing

Harry Mazer

At the poor, shambling, noisy end of the family there's Sam - fat, overtalkative and awed by his supercool and sophisticated cousin,
Lisa, from the apparently rich end of the clan. When Lisa's privileged world crumbles, it's Sam who helps her to find some balance, out of which both gain a better sense of reality and the value of family.
The pace is slightly slow in parts but there's a gentle humour and the developing closeness of the two teenagers is convincingly handled. It could be interesting to both boys and girls, which is a bit of a rarity.

Stanley's Aquarium

Barry Faville

Barry Faville writes with assurance and humour, vividly evoking his New Zealand setting and creating an intelligent and likeable first-person narrator. Robbie takes a jon gardening for elderly Stanley, finding him at first fascinating and later repellent; when she finds out what he keeps in his aquarium and what he plans to do with them, the book takes 'thrillerish' twist without losing its sharp insight into character and relationships. Unusual and compelling.

Dodger

Libby Gleeson

A painful, sad story where the troubled personal relationships plus the stormy school life of Mick are told though a skilful blend of flashback, a teacher's letters to a friend, the boys own notes and sympathetic narrative. Coming to terms with the negative expectations of others and his own poor sense of self-worth is achieved through a role in a school play and by an impressively sensitive first-year teacher.
Highly recommended, even though it's truly an agonising read, especially at the end.",C1,"Hide and Seek

In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't had time to develop any differences: genetically we're still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps.
On this grand evolutionary scale, whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art (whatever changes were needed in the human physique, brain, and sense organs) and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes.
That's a large burden to place on a relative handful of genes. It should come as no surprise, then, that modern studies of animal behaviour have been shrinking the list of attributes once considered uniquely human, so that most differences between us and animals now appear to be only matters of degree.
For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees (which use sticks as eating utensils and weapons), and sea otters (which crack open clams with rocks). As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals. But if human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, isn't it strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps?
The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art, in the form of the famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces and musical instruments.
If we're going to insist that our recent creative burst finally does set us apart, then in what ways do we claim that our art differs from the superficially similar works of animals? Three supposed distinctions are often put forward: human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Let's scrutinise these claims.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless"". The implicit meaning a biologist sees behind this quip is that human an doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes -- the evident functions of most animal behaviours. Of course, much human an is utilitarian in the sense that the artist communicates something to fellow humans, but transmitting one's thoughts or feelings isn't the same as passing on one's genes. In contrast, birdsong serves the obvious functions of defending a territory or wooing a mate, and thereby transmitting genes. By this criterion human art does seem different.
The second claim -- that only human art not is motivated by aesthetic pleasure -- also seems plausible. While we can't ask robins whether they enjoy the form or beauty of their songs, it's suspicious that they sing mainly during the breeding season. Hence they're probably not singing just for aesthetic pleasure. Again, by this criterion human art seems unique.
As for human art's third distinction -- that it's a learned rather than an instinctive activity -- each human group does have distinctive art styles that surely are learned. For example, it's easy to distinguish typical songs being sung today in Tokyo and in Paris. But those stylistic differences aren't wired into the singers genes. The French and Japanese often visit each other's cities and can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some species of birds inherit the ability to produce the particular song of their species. Each of those birds would sing the right song even if it had never heard the tune. It's as if a French baby adopted by Japanese parents, flown in infancy to Tokyo and educated there, began to sing the French national anthem spontaneously.
The role of learning in human art is also clear in how quickly our an styles change. Roman authors described geese honking 2,000 years ago, as geese still do today. But humans innovate so rapidly that even a casual museum-goer would recognise almost any twentieth century painting as having been made later than, say, the Mona Lisa. Connoisseurs can do better, of course. When shown a work with which they are not familiar, they can often identify not only when it was painted but who painted it.
Yet even connoisseurs would mistake the identity of two mid-twentieth century artists named Congo and Betsy. If judged only by their works, they would probably be identified as lesser-known abstract expressionists. In fact the painters were chimpanzees. Congo did up to 33 paintings and drawings in one day, apparently for his own satisfaction, and threw a tantrum when his pencil was taken away.
Congo and Betsy were honoured by a two-chimp show of their paintings in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art. What's more, most of the paintings available at that show sold; plenty of human artists can't make that boast.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction. You might object that human art is still different because most human artists intend their art as a means of communication. The apes, on the other hand, were so indifferent to communicating with other apes that they just discarded their paintings. But that objection doesn't strike me as fatal, since even some human art that later became famous was created by artists for their private satisfaction.",C1,,,"NATURAL TALENTS

Humans and chimpanzees separated about seven million years ago. In that time, we have not changed very much. Our genes are still more than 98% the same as a chimpanzee's.

This means that the things that make us different from animals happened very recently. Our bodies and brains are almost the same. So, the ability to make art and other things that seem special to humans must come from only a very small number of our genes.

This is a big job for just a few genes. It is not surprising, then, that scientists who study animals are finding that many things we thought only humans could do are also done by animals. Now, most of the differences between us and animals are just a matter of how much we do them, not if we can do them.

For example, humans are not the only ones who use tools. Wild chimpanzees use sticks to eat and fight. Sea otters use rocks to break open clams. Monkeys have a simple language with different calls for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These discoveries mean there are very few things that are completely different between us and animals, except for art. But if art comes from special human genes, why did our ancestors wait for 6.9 million of those 7 million years before they started making art?

The first art was probably made from wood or body paint. But we don't know for sure because those materials don't last. We only have clear proof of human art from about 35,000 years ago, when the Cro-Magnon people made cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we say that this new creativity makes us special, then how is our art different from what animals make? People often say three things: human art is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not something we are born knowing. Let's look at these ideas.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us stay alive or have children, which are the main reasons for most animal behaviour. Of course, human artists often want to share ideas or feelings, but that is not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, for example, is used to protect a territory or find a mate, which helps pass on genes. So by this idea, human art does seem different.

Second, people say that only humans make art because they enjoy beauty. We cannot ask a bird if it likes the sound of its own song. But birds sing mostly when they are trying to find a mate, so they are probably not singing just for fun. Again, by this idea, human art seems special.

Third, people say human art is learned, not something we do by instinct. Different groups of people have different art styles, and they learn them. For example, you can easily tell the difference between a song from Tokyo and one from Paris. These differences are not in our genes. A French person can go to Japan and learn a Japanese song. But some types of birds are born knowing their species' song. They can sing it correctly even if they have never heard it before. It would be like a French baby, raised in Tokyo by Japanese parents, suddenly starting to sing the French national anthem.

We can also see that learning is important in human art because our styles change so quickly. Two thousand years ago, Roman writers said that geese honked, and geese still honk the same way today. But human art changes very fast. Even someone who doesn't know much about art can see that a painting from the 1900s looks more modern than the Mona Lisa. Experts can do even better. They can often look at an unknown painting and say when it was painted and who the artist was.

But even experts might be fooled by two artists from the mid-1900s named Congo and Betsy. If you only saw their paintings, you might think they were less famous abstract artists. In fact, Congo and Betsy were chimpanzees. Congo sometimes made 33 paintings in a single day, just because he wanted to. He got very angry when someone took his pencil away.

In 1957, there was an art show in London with paintings by these two chimpanzees. Many of the paintings were sold. Many human artists cannot say the same.

So, the paintings by our closest animal relatives make the line between human art and animal activity less clear. Like human art, the ape paintings were not useful for survival. The apes made them for their own enjoyment, not to get anything. You might say that human art is still different because human artists usually want to communicate with others. The apes did not care about that and just threw their paintings away. But this is not a perfect argument, because even some famous human art was made by artists just for themselves, not to share with others.","NATURAL TALENTS

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't had enough time to develop many differences. In fact, genetically we are still more than 98% the same as chimps.  
On this large evolutionary scale, whatever makes humans different from animals is very recent. Our biological history suggests that our ability to make art—and anything else we think is special to humans—must depend on only a small number of genes.

That is a lot to ask from just a few genes. So it is not surprising that modern studies of animal behaviour have reduced the number of qualities once thought to be only human. Now, most differences between humans and animals seem to be a matter of degree, not kind.

For example, tools are not only used by humans. Wild chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys even have a simple language with different warning calls for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with very few clear differences between humans and animals—except for art. But if human art came from a special genetic ability, isn't it strange that our ancestors didn't use it for most of the seven million years after they split from chimps?

The earliest art may have been wood carvings or body painting. But if that's true, we wouldn't know, because those materials don't survive. Only with the Cro-Magnons, starting about 35,000 years ago, do we have clear proof of human art, such as cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we say that this recent creativity makes us different, then how is our art different from what animals produce? Three ideas are often suggested: human art is not useful, it is made for beauty and pleasure, and it is learned, not genetic. Let’s look at these ideas more closely.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, “All art is quite useless.” A biologist would understand this to mean that human art doesn’t help us survive or pass on our genes—unlike most animal behaviour. Of course, human art can be useful because the artist communicates with others, but sharing thoughts or feelings is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong has clear purposes: defending territory or attracting a mate, which helps pass on genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.

The second idea—that only humans create art for aesthetic pleasure—also seems reasonable. We can’t ask birds if they enjoy the beauty of their songs, but it’s noticeable that they sing mainly during breeding season. So they probably aren’t singing just for pleasure. Again, by this measure, human art appears unique.

The third idea is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Different human groups have their own art styles that are clearly learned. For example, it’s easy to tell the difference between songs sung in Tokyo and Paris. These differences aren’t in the singers’ genes. French and Japanese people can visit each other’s countries and learn each other’s songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing their species’ song. They would sing it correctly even if they had never heard it before. It would be like a French baby adopted by Japanese parents, raised in Tokyo, suddenly singing the French national anthem.

Learning’s role in human art is also clear from how quickly our art styles change. Roman writers described geese honking 2,000 years ago, just as geese do today. But human art changes so fast that even a casual museum visitor could tell that a 20th-century painting was made after the Mona Lisa. Experts can do even better. When shown an unfamiliar painting, they can often say when it was painted and by whom.

But even experts might be confused by two artists from the mid-20th century named Congo and Betsy. If judged only by their work, they might be called unknown abstract expressionists. In fact, they were chimpanzees. Congo made up to 33 paintings and drawings in a single day, apparently for his own enjoyment, and became angry when his pencil was taken away.

Congo and Betsy had their own art show in 1957 at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts. Most of the paintings available at the show were sold—something many human artists cannot say.

These paintings by our closest animal relatives make the line between human art and animal activities less clear. Like human art, the ape paintings had no practical use. They were made not for reward, but for the painter’s own satisfaction. You might argue that human art is still different because most human artists want to communicate with others. The apes, however, didn’t care about communicating and simply threw their paintings away. But that argument isn’t completely convincing, because even some famous human art was originally made just for the artist’s private enjoyment.",,
210,"Young Masters

Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks again to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man's game.

After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. Mr Spassky is even older.
Chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. A new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win.
In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense: a chess clock is used to ensure that each player completes the stipulated number of moves in the allotted time - failure to do so results in immediate loss of the game. But now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. It is significant that, of the world's ten highest-ranked players, eight are under 30.
Nor is it only the way the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess is played off the board - and not just the battle for psychological advantage that Mr Fischer wages so well. Every professional must now take seriously his pre-match preparation, not least because the age of computer databases has had a profound impact on chess. A small portable computer can hold one million chess games, and give instant access to hundreds of games of a prospective opponent.
In one recent contest, each of the protagonists employed large teams of assistants to work round the clock searching for flaws in the other's repertoire. The opening stages of a chess game are now analysed to near exhaustion. Simply being better prepared in chess opening can be the deciding factor in the game.
The chess world today boasts more first-rate players than at any stage in its history. Hundreds of grandmasters chase modest prize money the world over. Success demands physical as well as mental exertion. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension.
The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. When this occurs, each player has only seconds to make several moves or face instant forfeiture. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire. Such moments are not for reflective intellectuals. The game descends into a primeval struggle in which nerves, tenacity and an overwhelming will to win separate victor from vanquished.
At the top level of chess, the pain of losing is unbearable. Winning brings immense satisfaction and a chance to recover from the nerves and exhaustion. But one victory is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready for the struggle the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9-11 days, with play on every day, and there is an all-year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more exacting. The 1984 encounter between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be aborted after several months on the grounds of mutual exhaustion. Mr Karpov had shed around two stone (10kg) in weight.
Can Mr Fischer defy these odds? He once declared ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess.""
This sentiment made his exodus from the chess world after 1972 seem even more inexplicable. But in some respects it was a fitting end to his story. It immortalised Bobby Fischer.
If he has come back for the money, he is onto a good thing. Whatever happens in his match with Mr Spassky, each will end up several million dollars richer. But if Mr Fischer has returned in the sincere belief that he can show he is still the best player in the world, the final result could be heartbreaking.",C1,,"Bobby Fischer is playing chess again after 20 years away. He is playing against his old opponent Boris Spassky. Bobby won the first game very well. But he is now 49 years old. He is older and not in good shape for playing. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in 20 years. Now, players want only to win. Young players are very good at chess. Most of the best players in the world are under 30 years old.

Playing chess is very hard on the mind and body. Games can last for many hours. Players must think very hard all the time. They use a chess clock. If they are too slow, they lose the game. Sometimes players must move very fast at the end.

Players now use computers to help them prepare. They study many games before they play. Being well prepared can help you win.

There are more good chess players now than before. They play in many competitions around the world. Winning is very important. Losing feels very bad.

Can Bobby Fischer win again? He says he only wants to play chess. He left chess for many years, which people found strange. Now he is playing again. If he is playing for money, he will get a lot. But if he wants to be the best in the world again, he might be very sad if he loses.","Bobby Fischer is trying to return to chess, but his age is a problem. Chess is now a game for younger people.

After 20 years away, Mr. Fischer is playing chess again against his old opponent, Boris Spassky. He won the first game very well. But the next games showed he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is 49 years old and has not played for a long time. Mr. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in 20 years. It became more popular because of Mr. Fischer. Now, chess is more about winning than about art or science. The only goal for top players is to win.

In international chess, it is important to be strong in your mind and body, not just smart. The games are very stressful. Players use a chess clock. If a player is too slow, they lose the game. Now, the games are longer, and players often have no breaks. This is better for young people. In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Eight of the world's top ten players are under 30 years old.

The way players prepare for games has also changed. Players now use computers to study. A small computer can store a million chess games. Players can look at their opponent's old games.

In a recent match, both players had teams of helpers. These helpers worked day and night to find mistakes in the other player's games. The start of a chess game is now studied very carefully. Being better prepared at the start can help you win.

There are more excellent chess players now than ever before. Many grandmasters play for small prizes around the world. A single game can last up to eight hours. Players must concentrate all the time. If they lose focus, they can lose the game. So the players are always very nervous.

The chess clock makes players even more nervous. At the end of a game, players often have very little time. They must make moves in just seconds or they will lose. Their minds work fast, and their hands move quickly. This is not a time for slow thinking. It is a basic fight where the stronger mind wins.

Losing a big chess game is very painful. Winning feels great and lets the player relax. But to win a tournament, you need to win many games. Most competitions last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. There are tournaments all year. World championship matches are even harder. One match in 1984 had to be stopped after many months because both players were too tired. One player lost 10 kilograms.

Can Mr. Fischer win against these problems? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This made it strange when he left chess after 1972. But in a way, it made his story unforgettable.

If he has returned for the money, that is good for him. Whatever happens in his match with Mr. Spassky, both will become much richer. But if Mr. Fischer truly believes he can still be the best in the world, the end could be very sad for him.","Bobby Fischer is trying to return to competitive chess, but his age is a big problem. Chess is now a game that young people dominate.

After twenty years away, Bobby Fischer is playing chess again against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer's win in the first game was a brilliant performance. However, the games that followed showed he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, has not practiced recently, and is not in good physical shape. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last twenty years. Fischer's own popularity helped make the game more professional. Today, the competitive side of chess is more important than the artistic side. For modern chess masters, the only goal is to win.

In international chess, a player's mental strength and physical energy are as important as their intelligence. The pressure has always been high because of chess clocks. Players must make a certain number of moves in a set time, or they lose immediately. Now, playing sessions are longer, and many games are played without stopping. This extra pressure gives an advantage to younger players. For the past thirty years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. It is important to note that eight of the world's top ten players are under 30 years old.

The way players prepare for games has also changed. A lot of modern chess happens away from the board. Every professional player must prepare carefully before a match. This is especially true now because of computer databases. A small computer can store a million chess games and show you hundreds of games by your next opponent.

In a recent important match, both players had large teams of helpers. These teams worked day and night to find mistakes in the other player's strategies. The first part of a chess game is now studied in great detail. Sometimes, being better prepared for the opening of the game is enough to decide who wins.

There are more top-level chess players today than ever before. Hundreds of grandmasters around the world compete for prize money. To be successful, you need to be strong both mentally and physically. A single game can last up to eight hours. During this time, the chess master is in a constant mental battle. If they lose concentration for a moment, it can be a disaster. This keeps the players in a state of nervous tension.

The chess clock makes this tension even worse. Games often end in a fast ""time scramble."" At this point, players have only seconds to make several moves, or they lose immediately. With their minds racing, the masters make moves very quickly. This requires a level of coordination that any athlete would respect. This is not a time for deep thinking. The game becomes a basic struggle where nerves, determination, and a strong will to win decide the result.

At the highest level of chess, losing is extremely painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress and tiredness. But one win is not enough to win a whole tournament. A chess master must be ready to fight again the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9 to 11 days, with games every day, and there are tournaments all year. World championship matches are even harder. The 1984 match in Moscow between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov had to be stopped after several months because both players were completely exhausted. Karpov had lost about 10 kilograms.

Can Fischer succeed despite these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This statement made his decision to leave chess after 1972 very difficult to understand. But in some ways, it was a perfect ending to his story. It made him a legend.

If he has come back for the money, he has made a good choice. No matter what happens in his match with Spassky, both players will become several million dollars richer. But if Fischer truly believes he can prove he is still the best player in the world, the final result could be very sad.",,

212,"Great sports

Women on a winning streak

To excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to just a haw brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, 27, skier

""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well or it's windy and you can't see, but you just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""

B. Caroline, 22, cyclist

""Two years ago I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I am because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money I do at least four hours' training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming and running.
My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he knows the time you have to put into it -- it would be impossible otherwise.""

C. Annabel, 26, rower

""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There's no continuity so the women's squad is basically a shambles. But it's great fun and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life.""

D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker

""At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different.
The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had as far as pain is concerned. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.""

E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer

""Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages.
When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!
You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been classed as eccentrics. It's great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection always trying to get round with a perfect lap.""

F. Alison, 28, triathlete

""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I'd really be one, c) racing is very social.
Men and women usually compete together but when an event is given coverage in the press, 90 per cent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 per cent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it.""",C1,,"Great Sports

Women who keep winning

It is hard to be very good at a sport, even for men. For women, it is even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time. They cannot have a normal life, so they must give up many things. But they are working hard and breaking records. Here, we talk to some great British sportswomen.

A. Jill, 27, skier

""It feels great to fly in the air and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes you feel sick or it is very windy. But you must continue. It is not easy to have another job because we train for ten months every year. You do not see your friends much. But I chose this life. In the British team, there are six men and three women. We all do the same competitions and are treated the same.""

B. Caroline, 22, cyclist

""Two years ago, I used a friend's bike for a charity race. I won because I was faster than the others. This was amazing because I never rode a bike before! I earn good money as a professional cyclist. But I worry that people think I am successful because of how I look, not because I am a good cyclist. So now, I only think about cycling. I train for at least four hours every day. I also swim and run. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands my life.""

C. Annabel, 26, rower

""Not many girls' schools have rowing, so it is hard for girls to start. Most women start when they are 19 or 20. This makes it hard to be the best in the world. Also, our coaches often stay for only one year. This is difficult for the team. But rowing is fun, I love being fit, and I have good friends.""

D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker

""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I did not know how big it was! Britain felt too small and safe for me. I was a very strong-minded girl. I did not like people telling me what to do. Now I am more careful. Every walk is different. Walking across Australia was very painful. I walked 50 miles every day for 21 hours. I slept for only three hours in very hot weather. I had 15 blisters on each foot. But I broke the record! I had to do it because my money was going to finish after 95 days. People think women will not succeed, so it is harder for women to get money for their sport.""

E. Lisa, 26, car racer

""Some men think they are very important when they drive. You see this on the roads. When I race well, these men do not talk to me. Being a woman in this sport is not easy. When we race, men think 'I must beat her', so they often hit my car! You need to be competitive. It is very difficult to earn money. All the money I make, I use for my sport. Women have been racing since the 1920s, but people thought they were strange. Now, more women start racing every year. I love car racing because I always try to do the perfect lap.""

F. Alison, 28, triathlete

""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. On Tuesday and Thursday, I sleep late. In the evening, I cycle or run. Sometimes, I am so tired I fall asleep at work! Before a race, I feel very nervous. During the race, you must try very hard. Sometimes I ask myself why I do this. There are three reasons: 1) I am happier when I am fit, 2) I am a lazy person inside, and this sport stops me from being lazy, 3) I have a good social life with other racers. Men and women usually race together. But when the newspaper writes about the race, 90% is about the men and only 10% is about the women. The prize money for women is also less. But now we have a new women's group, and we are trying to change this.""","Great Sports

213,"Sea, Ice & Rock

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy.
In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing.
It was the first time I'd been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin's skills at climbing.
The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.
He was used to using his arms, I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down quite safely. It was during that trip to Skye that Robin and I built the foundation of a very real friendship.
His proposal that we should combine our skills on a joint trip to Greenland was just an extension, on a rather grand scale, of our voyage to Skye. Robin impressed me immensely as a leader. Traditionally, the skipper makes all the decisions.
But Robin made a point of consulting everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel you were part of the decision-making process.
To be frank, I found the sailing trying and very boring. The moments of crisis which we had on the way back were easy to deal with: the adrenaline pumps and you get all worked up. The bit I found difficult was spending day after day in the middle of the sea.
I am a land-lover and not really a do-it-yourself type of person. Robin, in contrast, is a natural sailor and seemed to enjoy tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. I was aware that Robin didn't really need me.
To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that very trying. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.
When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin's life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral -- Greenland's highest mountain - would be.
Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.
He just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.
Yet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.
The previous night I'd almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd jumped to the wrong conclusion.
While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.",C1,,"Sea, Ice and Rock

Chris Bonington is a famous mountain climber. He is 58 years old. He climbed Mount Everest in 1985. He also climbed many mountains in Britain and the Alps. He wrote books about his adventures. Robin Knox-Johnston is 53 years old. He worked on ships when he was young. In 1968-69, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat, Sunhaili. He also broke a record for sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. Chris and Robin decided to work together. They sailed and climbed in Greenland. They wrote a book about their trip called ""Sea, Ice and Rock.""

In 1979, Chris was writing a book. He called Robin to ask some questions. Robin invited Chris to go sailing. Chris could teach Robin about climbing, and Robin could teach Chris about sailing. It was Chris's first time on a sailboat. They sailed for a short time and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat. Chris and Robin went to the shore to try climbing.

The climb was not easy. Chris was surprised that Robin was very calm. Robin climbed quietly. Then they came to a very high point. Chris asked Robin if he had climbed before. Robin said no, so Chris showed him how. When Chris finished, Robin asked if he could go down the rock like he goes down ropes on his boat. Robin was strong in his arms, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Chris was a little worried, but Robin went down safely. On that trip, Chris and Robin became good friends.

Later, Robin had an idea. He asked Chris to go on a big trip to Greenland together. Chris thought Robin was a very good leader. Usually, the captain of a boat makes all the decisions. But Robin always asked the crew first. This made people feel good, even if they did not have advice.

Chris did not really like sailing. He thought it was boring. When there was a problem on the boat, it was exciting. But he did not like being on the sea for many days. Chris likes the land more. Robin, however, loves the sea. He likes to fix the boat's engine or toilet. Chris sometimes felt he was not very useful on the boat. The boat was also very small for six people. On a mountain, you have more space.

In Greenland, it was Chris's turn to lead the climb. He felt it was difficult to be responsible for Robin's life. If Robin fell, he could pull Chris down with him. Chris had to be very careful. The mountain, called The Cathedral, was harder than Chris thought. Robin is not a natural climber, so his hard work was impressive. One time, they climbed for 24 hours without stopping. On the way down, they were so tired they almost fell asleep on the steep mountain. Robin trusted Chris completely and just followed him. When Chris said they had to turn back, Robin agreed. Chris knew Robin was also worried about his boat. But Robin still wanted to try climbing the mountain again.

One time, there was almost a problem between them. On the boat going home, they took turns watching at night. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am, but Robin did not wake him. Robin thought he could do it alone. The night before, Chris was very tired and almost fell asleep. Chris felt that Robin did not trust him. He told Robin how he felt. Robin said that was not true and made Chris feel better.

After the trip to Greenland, Chris and Robin knew each other very well. Chris learned that Robin is a kind and sensitive person.","Sea, Ice and Rock

214,"POWER DRESSING

EVERY SUMMER, the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world, where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? How do they get away with it? The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues of the Open University are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try, a century after Darwin's death, to settle the matter.
Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. That is, in a crowded and hence competitive world, the individuals best suited to the circumstances - the 'fittest' - are the most likely to survive and have offspring.
But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert. The peacocks tail, by contrast, was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance, and Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'. The driving mechanism was simply that females liked -- in his words - 'beauty for beauty's sake'.
But Darwin's friend and collaborator, Alfred Russel Wallace, though in many ways more 'romantic' than Darwin, was in others even more Darwinian. 'Beauty for beauty's sake' he wanted nothing of. If peahens chose cocks with the showiest trains, he felt, then it must be that they knew what they were about. The cocks must have some other quality, which was not necessarily obvious to the human observer, but which the hens themselves could appreciate. According to Wallace, then, the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.
Now, 100 years later, the wrangle is still unresolved, for the natural behaviour of peafowl is much harder to study than might be imagined. But 200
birds at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds yet are used to human beings, offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues at
Whipsnade have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
In practice, the mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.
But whether the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down. William Hamilton of Oxford University has put forward the hypothesis that showy male birds in general, of whatever species, are the most parasite-free, and that their plumage advertises their disease-free state. There is evidence that this is so in other birds. But Dr Petrie and her colleagues have not been able to assess the internal parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks to test this hypothesis. This year, however, she is comparing the offspring of cocks that have in the past proved attractive to hens with the offspring of cocks that hens find unattractive. Do the children of the attractive cocks grow faster? Are they more healthy? If so, then the females' choice will be seen to be utilitarian after all, just as Wallace predicted. 
There is a final twist to this continuing story. The great mathematician and biologist R A Fisher in the thirties proposed what has become known as 'Fisher's Runaway'. Just suppose, for example, that for whatever reason - perhaps for a sound 'Wallacian' reason a female first picks a male with a slightly better tail than the rest. The sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This is how the runaway begins. Within each generation, the males with the longest tails will get most mates and leave most offspring, and the females predilection for long tails will increase commensurately. Modern computer models show that such a feedback mechanism would alone be enough to produce a peacocks tail. Oddly, too, this would vindicate Darwin's apparently fanciful notion - once the process gets going, the females would indeed be selecting 'beauty for beauty's sake'.",C1,,"Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Animal Park show their big, beautiful tails. The female birds watch them. This made Charles Darwin think a lot. He asked: Why do these birds have such big tails? In nature, animals must be strong to live. But the peacock's tail is very big. It seems to make life harder, not easier.

Darwin had an idea. He thought female birds like the beautiful tails. He called this ""sexual selection."" But his friend Wallace did not agree. He said the beautiful tail shows the male bird is healthy and strong.

Now, scientists at Whipsnade are studying the peacocks. They want to know two things. First, do the female birds choose the males with the best tails? Second, are those males better in other ways?

The scientists watch the birds. They see that the females like the males with the most spots on their tails. These males find more mates.

But are these males stronger or healthier? Another scientist thinks birds with nice feathers have fewer sicknesses. The scientists at Whipsnade are checking this. They are also looking at the baby birds. They want to see if the babies of the popular males grow faster and stay healthy.

There is one more idea. A scientist named Fisher said that if females like long tails, the tails will get longer over time. The males with the longest tails will have more babies. The females will like long tails even more. This could be why peacocks have such amazing tails. In this way, the females really are choosing beauty because they like it.","Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their beautiful tail feathers to the female birds. This brings up a question that interested Charles Darwin: in a world where animals compete to survive, why would birds develop something that seems unnecessary? How does this help them? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find an answer.

Darwin believed that animals change over time through a process called evolution. He said that in nature, the animals best suited to their environment are the ones most likely to survive and have babies. This is called natural selection.

However, a peacock’s tail doesn’t seem useful for survival. In fact, it might even make life harder for the bird. Darwin thought that females might choose males based on their looks alone. He called this idea ""sexual selection.""

But Darwin’s friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if female birds prefer males with impressive tails, it must be because those males have other good qualities that help them survive. The tail is like an advertisement for a healthy and strong bird.

Today, scientists are still trying to understand this. At Whipsnade, the peacocks live freely but are used to people, so they are easier to study. Marion Petrie’s team is asking two main questions: Do female birds really choose males with the most beautiful tails? And do those males have other qualities that make them better partners?

After watching the birds for a long time, researchers found that females do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails. But are these males actually healthier or stronger? Some scientists think that bright feathers might mean the bird has fewer parasites or diseases. Dr. Petrie is now studying the baby birds of attractive and less attractive males to see if the babies of the attractive ones grow faster or are healthier.

There is another interesting idea called ""Fisher’s Runaway."" It suggests that if females start preferring longer tails, this preference can grow over time. Males with longer tails will have more babies, and females will continue to prefer longer tails. This could eventually lead to very large and beautiful tails, just like the peacock’s. In this case, Darwin’s idea of ""beauty for beauty’s sake"" might also be correct.","Every summer, the male peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show off their large, colorful tails to the female peahens. This behavior presents a question that troubled Charles Darwin: in a competitive natural world, how could such a showy and impractical feature evolve? How do these birds survive with it? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are now studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, over a century after Darwin's death, to find an answer.

Darwin believed that living things evolved through natural selection. This means that in a competitive environment, the individuals best adapted to their surroundings are the most likely to survive and reproduce.

However, this idea suggests that the ""fittest"" should be the strongest, fastest, or smartest. A peacock's tail seems like a waste of energy and a disadvantage. Because of this, Darwin proposed a second evolutionary process called 'sexual selection.' He thought that females chose males simply because they found them beautiful.

Darwin's colleague, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be a practical reason. He thought the tail was like an advertisement, showing that the male had other good qualities that helped survival.

Today, the debate continues. Studying wild peafowl is difficult, but the birds at Whipsnade, which are used to people, provide a special opportunity. Marion Petrie's research focuses on two main questions. First, do peahens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? Second, do those males have other useful qualities, as Wallace thought, or is it just about appearance, as Darwin suggested?

Observations show that the males display together in certain areas, and the females compare them. Research confirms that females are indeed attracted to the males with the most ""eye"" patterns on their tails. The males with the most eye-spots get the most mates.

But are these males also better in other ways? One theory is that a showy appearance signals that a bird is healthy and free from parasites. There is evidence for this in other bird species. Dr. Petrie's team has not yet been able to check the Whipsnade peacocks for parasites. However, this year she is comparing the young of attractive males with the young of unattractive ones. Do the chicks of the attractive males grow faster? Are they healthier? If so, then the females' choice is practical, just as Wallace predicted.

There is one more interesting idea. A scientist named R.A. Fisher proposed a theory called 'Fisher's Runaway.' Imagine a female chooses a male with a slightly longer tail. Their sons will inherit the long tail, and their daughters will inherit the preference for long tails. Over many generations, males with the longest tails will have the most offspring, and the females' preference for long tails will grow stronger. Computer models show this process could create the peacock's tail. In a way, this supports Darwin's original idea—once this cycle starts, females really would be choosing beauty for its own sake.",,
215,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West?

Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Some GPs, midwives and physios use it regularly for pain relief.

A. What's it all about? 

Traditional Chinese medicine sees health as a state in which the energy of the mind, body and spirit are in harmony. According to the theory, energy or Qi (pronounced chee) flows around the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each linked to an internal organ, and lots of tiny meridians take Qi to every cell. When the flow of Oi is upset, blocked or weakened, the body is said to be out of balance: weakness or illness may result. During a consultation with a traditional acupuncturist, he or she will try to find where imbalances occur in the Qi. This is done by feeling pulses on your wrist, examining your tongue and assessing your general appearance. He or she will ask about your medical history, current health, general well-being, state of mind, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin. He or she may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians, to stimulate the flow of Qi.

B. Over three hundred points
 
The points used for acupuncture are related to meridians so won't necessarily be near the site of the complaint. People often say they feel a not unpleasant dull ache or tingling sensation when the needle is gently manipulated. This is either done by hand or by attaching the needle to an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this sensation shows the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian.
There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

C. Science tells us how

Without accepting the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, doctors here have accepted that acupuncture can work for pain relief. This is because they have been able to provide scientific explanations of how it might work. For example: 
* It has been suggested that stimulating particular nerves blocks pain signals and stops them from reaching the brain.
* Some scientists believe that stimulating acupuncture points releases natural pain-relieving substances (endorphins).

D. What type of pain can be treated?

Many people with chronic long-term pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. Back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine and post-operative pain are commonly treated with acupuncture.
Other types of pain which acupuncturists claim to treat include menstrual pain, facial nerve pain and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

E. Modern use for an ancient treatment

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, one development has been rather more recent. The use of acupuncture instead of anaesthesia during surgery only started in the 1950s. It was this that helped to convince some doctors outside China that there was more to acupuncture than mind over matter.
In China today, acupuncture is used during all sorts of operations, from tonsillectomies to caesareans, and is even used in open heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation or with drugs. It's claimed that the pain is more or less eliminated, but it varies from person to person. It's hard to imagine many of us finding the option of lying awake on the operating table very attractive. But acupuncturists say that acupuncture anaesthesia involves none of the side-effects of conventional anaesthetics (e.g. nausea), and you recover from it more quickly.

F. Always effective

As with most complementary therapies, clinical trials to evaluate acupuncture are difficult to run. But trials that have been done have shown that 50 to 80 per cent of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally quote a similar success rate. They accept that it won't work for everyone and that people vary in their responsiveness.
Traditional acupuncturists say that for chronic long-term pain it will usually take between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief. But some improvement should be felt after just two or three visits.

G. A different approach to pain

But Western and Chinese medicine view pain rather differently. Like most alternative therapists, an acupuncturist views his or her patient in a holistic way. This means not just focusing on specific symptoms. An acupuncturist spends a long time making a diagnosis, trying to find underlying weaknesses in the Oi. He or she will also want to know what external factors are causing the pain. For instance, is the pain worse in the cold, heat, damp or wind? Does it feel sharp, dull, throbbing, constant or burning? These are seen as important factors in deciding how acupuncture can be used to treat the pain. It's unlikely that your average medical doctor would take such things into account, isn't it?

H. Traditional or not?

Some medical professionals do have traditional acupuncture training. Others - including many GPs who practise acupuncture reject traditional Chinese theory and subscribe to scientific explanations.
But many traditional acupuncturists believe that only by applying traditional Chinese medicine is it possible to bring about deep changes that lead to a longer cure - something that is very difficult to assess in trials.
Care should always be taken in choosing an acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for funner investigation if necessary.",C1,,,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West?**

Acupuncture is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also uses herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. It can treat many problems, but in the West, doctors are most interested in how it helps with pain. Some family doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it often to help people feel less pain.

**A. What is it?**

Traditional Chinese medicine believes you are healthy when the energy of your mind, body, and spirit are in balance. This energy is called Qi (sounds like ""chee""). It moves through your body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ inside your body. Many small meridians carry Qi to all your cells. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, your body is out of balance, and you may feel sick or weak.

When you see an acupuncturist, they will check where your Qi is not balanced. They do this by feeling the pulse in your wrist, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, lifestyle, and how you feel. Then, they put very thin needles into your skin at certain points. Sometimes they also use warmth from herbs or pressure to help the Qi flow better.

**B. Over 300 points**

The points where the needles go are on the meridians. They are not always near the part of your body that hurts. When the needle is moved, people often feel a dull ache or a tingling feeling. This feeling means the needle has reached the Qi. There are more than 300 points on the main meridians, and many more that are used less often.

**C. Science explains how it works**

Many Western doctors agree that acupuncture can help with pain, even if they do not believe in the idea of Qi. Science can explain why it might work. For example:
* It may stop pain signals from going to your brain.
* It may help your body make its own natural pain-relieving chemicals.

**D. What kind of pain can it treat?**

Many people try acupuncture when other treatments for long-term pain do not work. It is often used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after an operation. Acupuncturists also say it can help with period pain, face pain, and pain for people who are very ill.

**E. A modern use for an old treatment**

Acupuncture is very old, but one new use started in the 1950s. In China, doctors began using it instead of anaesthesia for some operations. This made some doctors outside China believe that acupuncture really works.

Today in China, acupuncture is used in many operations, even for heart surgery. Sometimes needles are used alone, sometimes with a little electricity or with medicine. People say they feel much less pain, but it is different for everyone. Most people would not like to be awake during an operation, but acupuncturists say there are no bad side effects, like feeling sick, and you get better faster.

**F. Does it always work?**

It is hard to do perfect studies on acupuncture, but the studies we have show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps their long-term pain. Acupuncturists say the same. It does not work for everyone, and some people feel the effects more than others.

For long-term pain, you may need six or seven visits to feel much better. But many people feel some improvement after just two or three visits.

**G. A different way to see pain**

Western medicine and Chinese medicine see pain in different ways. An acupuncturist looks at the whole person, not just the pain. They spend a long time finding the real cause of the problem in your Qi. They also ask about things around you. For example, is the pain worse when it is cold, hot, wet, or windy? Does the pain feel sharp, dull, or burning? These things help them decide how to treat you. A normal doctor usually does not ask these questions.

**H. Traditional or not?**

Some doctors are trained in traditional acupuncture. Others, including some family doctors who use it, do not believe in the Qi theory and only follow the scientific explanations.

But many traditional acupuncturists believe you need the traditional ideas to make deep changes for a longer-lasting cure. This is hard to test in studies.

If you want to try acupuncture, be careful when you choose a practitioner. A good acupuncturist will tell you to see a doctor if you need more medical tests.",,,
216,"BOOK A

Steve Martin's Compelling Evidence is compelling indeed. The narrator, a lawyer struggling to build a new practice after being forced to leave a high-
powered law firm, finds himself manoeuvred into defending his boss's wife when she is tried for her husbands murder. The trial scenes are riveting, with the outcome in doubt right up to the verdict, and a really unexpected twist in the final pages. This is a terrific debut into a crowded genre.

BOOK B

Curtains for the Cardinal begins with a bang, and plunges the charismatic Sigismondo, troubleshooter for the aristocracy of the Italian Renaissance, into a turmoil of politics, clerical intrigue and high-wodety murder from which we are always confident he will emerge unscathed to disclose the guilty parties. The plot is convoluted and the book is about 50 pages overweight, but it is still great stuff.

BOOK C

File Under: Deceased introduces a refreshingly different new detective from a first novelist, Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector, ideally positioned, it seems, for a bit of investigating when a strange man falls dead at her feet. Undaunted by attacks from various quarters - perhaps tax inspectors are used to this sort of thing - and the disapproval of her handsome local detective sergeant, gutsy, versatile Leah is a winner in every way.

BOOK D

Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker sets that most literate of private investigators, Spenser, the job of assisting his friend Hawk to clear drug dealers out of a deprived estate in rundown Boston. The slick dialogue comes almost as fast as the bullets, but there are few corpses and more philosophy than usual. High-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

BOOK E

False Prophet by Faye Kellermann, features her usual pair of detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, investigating an attack and burglary at the house of a legendary film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and eye for odd human behaviour make this an entertaining mystery.

BOOK F

Husband and wife, Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, write as a team. Blood Red, Snow White features another lawyer, another female client, but the action is all outside the courtroom and the defender finds himself becoming the victim as the plot unravels. All the classic ingredients of romance, money and violence are mixed efficiently to produce an engrossing suspense novel.

BOOK G

Dead for a Ducat by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher in a new role, that of intended victim. The hilarious collection of characters are brought together to film the story of Robin Hood, but Philip isn't the only person to feel this is not the way his career should be developing. Simon Shaw never fails to entertain, but in moving his star actor from black comedy to farce, he gives a performance below his usual high standard.

BOOK H

Fall Down Easy is Lawrence Gough's best book for some time. Canadian police hunt a versatile bank robber who preys on female bank tellers. The slow, expertly-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the clever, disturbed robber raise this way above the average detective novel.",C1,"**BOOK A**

Steve Martin's book is very good. A lawyer must help his boss's wife. She is in court because people say she killed her husband. The court parts are exciting. You do not know what will happen. The end is a surprise. This is a very good first book.

**BOOK B**

This book starts fast. Sigismondo helps important people in old Italy. There is a lot of trouble and someone is killed. We know he will find the bad person. The story is long but it is very good.

**BOOK C**

This is a first book by Sarah Lacey. The detective is a tax inspector. A man dies near her. She looks for answers. People are not nice to her, but she is strong. She is a very good character.

**BOOK D**

In this book, a detective helps his friend. They want to stop bad people who sell drugs in a poor part of the city. They talk a lot and think a lot. There is not too much fighting. It is a good book.

**BOOK E**

This book has two detectives. They look into a problem at a famous person's house. Someone broke in and hurt a person. The story is easy to read and interesting.

**BOOK F**

A husband and wife write this book together. It is about a lawyer and his woman client. The story is not in a court. The lawyer has many problems. The book has love, money, and danger. It is a good story.

**BOOK G**

In this book, an actor is in a film about Robin Hood. But someone wants to hurt him. The other people in the story are funny. The book is not the writer's best work, but it is okay.

**BOOK H**

This is a good book by Lawrence Gough. Police in Canada look for a man who steals from banks. He is not a normal bad person. The story makes you feel nervous, but in a good way. It is better than many other detective books.",,"**BOOK A**

Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is a very interesting book. The main character is a lawyer. He had to leave his important job at a big law firm and is now trying to start his own business. He must defend his old boss's wife. She is on trial for killing her husband. The parts of the book about the trial are very exciting. You don't know what the final decision will be until the very end. There is also a big surprise in the last few pages. This is a very good first book in a popular type of story.

**BOOK B**

*Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, is a charming man who solves problems for rich and important people in Italy long ago. He quickly gets involved in dangerous politics, secrets in the church, and murder. We always feel sure that he will be safe and find the criminals. The story is complicated and a little too long, but it is still a very good book.

**BOOK C**

*File Under: Deceased* introduces a new and interesting detective from a first-time writer, Sarah Lacey. The detective, Leah Hunter, works for the tax office. When a strange man dies right in front of her, she is in a good position to investigate. People attack her from different places, but she is not afraid. The local police officer, who is good-looking, does not want her to help, but she doesn't listen. Brave and capable Leah is a great character.

**BOOK D**

In *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker, the private detective Spenser is a very intelligent man. His job this time is to help his friend Hawk. They must stop drug dealers in a poor part of Boston. The characters talk in a very clever and fast way. There is some shooting, but not many people die. The book also has more thoughtful ideas than usual. It is high-quality fun, which is normal for this writer.

**BOOK E**

*False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has her usual detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They are investigating a violent attack and a robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The writer has a simple and easy style. She is also very good at writing about strange human behaviour. This makes the mystery fun to read.

**BOOK F**

A husband and wife, Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, write this book together. *Blood Red, Snow White* is about another lawyer and another female client. However, the story does not happen in a courtroom. As the story continues, the lawyer finds that he is in danger and is becoming the victim. The book has all the usual parts of a good story: love, money, and violence. It is a very interesting suspense novel.

**BOOK G**

In *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw, the actor Philip Fletcher is in a new situation: someone wants to kill him. A funny group of people come together to make a film about Robin Hood. Philip is not the only person who thinks this job is bad for his career. Simon Shaw's books are always fun to read. But in this story, he changes his main character's story from a dark comedy to a silly comedy. It is not as good as his other books.

**BOOK H**

*Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a long time. Police in Canada are trying to find a clever bank robber. This criminal only robs women who work in banks. The story slowly builds a feeling of worry and fear. The writer also does a very good job of showing us the intelligent but troubled robber. This makes the book much better than most other detective stories.",,,
217,"With the trees, I planted my stake in New Zealand

JONATHON PORRITT

TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER

Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'.
I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn't have any summers. I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot, which was great, because I like winter.
My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which 'the kids', my brother, sister and I, could look after. Mother said, 'If you can take the time and trouble to plant it with trees then you can have it.' The idea was that we would always have a stake in New Zealand, which is a lovely idea as my father was actually brought up there. And they found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. It's rather poor land, really, but it's quite good for planting trees on.
I've always been very keen and enthusiastic about land. I'd spent a year in Australia working on sheep stations and helping out in different farming jobs, and so the idea of planting trees sounded like a very nice idea, and I was immediately keen. I think the rest of the family got enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres.
In New Zealand in 1968 it was one of those winters. It rained an awful lot, endlessly in fact, and in a way it's idiotic to think back on it as such an immensely happy time as it rained pretty well most days that we were planting, and I don't suppose I've ever been wetter or colder for such a prolonged period.
There was a moment of truth every morning: getting ready for the next planting session. Coming out of the Land Rover relatively warm and dry, with the rain coming down, and your anorak still clammy from the day before, boots still sodden, hands fumbling with slippery laces.
'The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts, ideas and reflections about life.'
In that first year I had a guy to work with me who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful as I'd never planted trees seriously before all this. You have a planting bag around your neck which you fill with as many trees as you possibly can, and when your bag is full it's a nightmare, and it's only as it gets lighter that life gets easier.
In a way, the most difficult bit of the entire operation was getting the lines straight. You work out what spacing you're going to plant the trees at, and then you line up a series of three poles across as long a trajectory as you can get, and those poles then determine your lines. Once you're in line, you just plant all the way down the line till you get to the end, turn around and come back again. I enjoy hard physical work, and it certainly made me fit.
After a certain point you can plant trees almost on automatic, you become used to a rhythm, and you use the minimum number of spade strokes that you need to get the hole in the ground. The rhythm is something that everybody tells you about and, of course, it's true of many agricultural jobs that you actually have to train the body into a series of quite standardised moves, and then it becomes immensely easy: so you develop an absolutely regular process of taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it in, and moving on. Mentally, it's very interesting. The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts and ideas and reflections about life - a lot of my thinking about the natural world and our place in it, all of those things that have since dominated my life, first began to pop through my head in those days.
I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees gradually grow, which has been very satisfying when you actually planted the things and you do then have a kind of stake in what happens and how they prosper.
I always dread reading in the newspapers stories of another high wind in New Zealand, or Worst Drought Ever Hits New Zealand. Such headlines make me feel extremely apprehensive. However, it worked out extremely well and those trees are now 20 years old, and in good fettle.
The only postscript I should add is that I took a term off from teaching, and I went back there in 1984, completely on my own for three months. And I wrote my first book there, Seeing Green. There's a little cabin on the tree farm which is fantastically basic, just a bed, a table and a chair. In the mornings I would do my writing; in the afternoons I would go off and prune the trees, and then do research in the evenings.
The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong. In many respects it's the place that I feel most closely identified with in terms of that link between people and the earth: it's a most powerful bond.",C1,,"A special time in my life was when I had no summers. I went to New Zealand every summer here, which is winter there. I had nine winters in a row. I liked that because I enjoy winter.

My parents had an idea. They bought a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to look after. My mother said, ""If you take the time to plant trees on it, you can have it."" The idea was for us to always have a connection to New Zealand. This was nice because my father grew up there. They found land near Auckland. The land was not very good, but it was good for trees.

I have always liked the land. I worked in Australia for a year on farms with sheep. So, planting trees sounded like a good idea to me. I was happy to do it. My family also became interested. I started in 1968. By 1972, the three of us had planted all 70 acres.

In 1968, the winter in New Zealand had a lot of rain. It rained almost every day we planted. It seems funny now, but it was a very happy time. I was often wet and cold for a long time.

Every morning was difficult. I got out of the car, which was warm and dry. The rain was falling. My coat was still wet from the day before. My boots were wet. My hands had trouble with the wet shoe laces.

In the first year, a man worked with me. He knew how to plant trees. This helped me a lot. You wear a bag around your neck and fill it with trees. When the bag is full, it is very heavy. It gets better when the bag becomes lighter.

The hardest part was making the lines of trees straight. You decide how far apart to put the trees. You use poles to make a long, straight line. Then you plant along that line. I like hard work, and this made me strong.

After a while, you can plant trees without thinking too much. You find a rhythm. You use your spade to make a hole. You take a tree from the bag, put it in the hole, push the earth down, and move to the next spot. Your mind is free to think about other things. I started to think a lot about nature and people. These thoughts became very important in my life later.

I have visited New Zealand four times since then. I watched the trees grow. It feels good because I planted them. I feel connected to them and their future.

I don't like to read news about strong winds or very dry weather in New Zealand. It makes me worried. But everything went well. The trees are now 20 years old and are healthy.

One more thing: In 1984, I stopped teaching for a few months. I went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book there, called 'Seeing Green'. There is a small, simple cabin on the land with a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote. In the afternoons, I cut parts of the trees to help them grow. In the evenings, I did research.

My connection to that place is still very strong. It is the place where I feel closest to the land. It is a powerful feeling.","Jonathon Porritt is the author of a book about the politics of ecology.

I had a very unusual time in my life when I did not have any summers. I travelled to New Zealand every summer here, which is winter in New Zealand. So I had nine winters in a row. It was great because I like winter.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was a very rainy winter. It rained a lot, almost every day while we were planting. It seems silly to remember it as a very happy time, but I do. I don't think I have ever been wetter or colder for such a long time.

Every morning was difficult. We got ready to plant more trees. We came out of the Land Rover, which was warm and dry. The rain was falling, and our coats were still wet from the day before. Our boots were still full of water, and our hands had trouble with the wet shoelaces.

Once you are in line, you plant all the way to the end, turn around, and come back. I enjoy hard physical work, and this work made me fit.

After some time, you can plant trees almost without thinking. You get used to a rhythm. You use the fewest number of spade movements to make a hole. Everyone tells you about this rhythm. It is true for many farm jobs. You train your body to do the same movements, and then it becomes very easy. You develop a regular process: take a tree from the bag, dig a hole, put the tree in, push the earth down, and move on. Mentally, it is very interesting. Your brain starts to think about many different things and ideas about life. A lot of my thoughts about the natural world and our place in it started in my head during those days.

I have been back to New Zealand four times since then. I watched the trees grow slowly. It is very satisfying because you planted them and you have a connection to what happens to them.

I always worry when I read in the newspaper about strong winds or very bad droughts in New Zealand. Those headlines make me feel very nervous. But everything worked out well. Those trees are now 20 years old and are healthy.

One more thing: I took a break from teaching in 1984. I went back to New Zealand alone for three months. I wrote my first book, ""Seeing Green,"" there. There is a small, simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote. In the afternoons, I cut branches from the trees. In the evenings, I did research.

My connection to that area is still very strong. In many ways, it is the place where I feel most connected to the link between people and the earth. It is a very powerful feeling.","Jonathan Porritt is the author of 'Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology'. He spoke with Danny Danziger.

There was a strange period in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer here, which is winter there, so I experienced nine consecutive winters. I really appreciated this because I enjoy winter weather.

My parents came up with the idea of purchasing a small piece of land that my brother, sister and I could manage. My mother told us, 'If you're willing to invest the time and effort to plant trees here, then you can have it.' The intention was for us to maintain a permanent connection to New Zealand, which was meaningful since my father had been raised there. They located a plot approximately 20 miles north of Auckland in an area called Rangitoupuni. The soil quality isn't particularly good, but it's adequate for growing trees.

I've always had a strong interest in land and nature. Having spent a year in Australia working on sheep stations and various farming jobs, the prospect of planting trees appealed to me immediately, and I became enthusiastic about the project. I believe my family grew more interested as we progressed. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had successfully planted all 70 acres.

The winter of 1968 in New Zealand was particularly challenging. It rained excessively, almost continuously, and it seems somewhat strange to recall it as such a joyful period since it rained during most of our planting days. I doubt I've ever been more wet or cold for such an extended duration.

Each morning presented a moment of truth: preparing for the day's planting. Emerging from the relatively warm, dry Land Rover into the falling rain, putting on a damp coat from the previous day, pulling on soaked boots, and struggling with slippery shoelaces.

During that initial year, I worked alongside an experienced tree-planter, which proved invaluable since I had no previous serious planting experience. You wear a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's quite challenging, and only as it becomes lighter does the work feel more manageable.

Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the entire process was maintaining straight planting lines. You determine the appropriate spacing between trees, then align three poles across the longest possible distance to establish your planting lines. Once positioned correctly, you simply plant along the line until reaching the end, then turn around and continue planting on the return journey. I genuinely enjoy demanding physical work, and this activity certainly improved my fitness.

After some time, you reach a point where tree planting becomes almost automatic. You develop a steady rhythm and learn to use the minimum number of spade movements required to create each hole. This rhythmic approach is something everyone mentions, and it applies to many agricultural tasks where you must train your body to perform standardized motions until they become effortless. You establish a consistent routine: removing the tree from your bag, digging the hole, placing the tree, firming the soil, and moving forward. Mentally, this process is fascinating. Your mind becomes free to entertain various unusual thoughts and reflections about life. Much of my thinking about the natural world and humanity's place within it—ideas that have since become central to my life—first emerged during those planting days.

I've returned to New Zealand four times since then and have observed the trees gradually maturing. This is deeply satisfying when you were personally involved in planting them and maintain a connection to their development and prosperity.

I always feel concerned when reading newspaper headlines about severe winds or record-breaking droughts affecting New Zealand. Such news makes me quite anxious. Fortunately, everything has progressed well, and those trees are now twenty years old and in excellent condition.

I should add that I took a term off from teaching and returned alone in 1984 for three months. It was during this visit that I wrote my first book, 'Seeing Green'. There's a very basic cabin on the tree farm containing only a bed, table, and chair. My routine involved writing in the mornings, pruning trees in the afternoons, and conducting research in the evenings.

My connection to that area remains incredibly strong. In many ways, it's the place where I feel most deeply connected to the relationship between people and the earth—a profoundly powerful bond.",,
218,"The long-distance runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. This gorgeous, if lonely and isolated, spot is Nanyuk: for the past three years it has been my base for mid-winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands.
But not once on those trips had I trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil. On my fourth and most recent winter training trip to Kenya, however, I broke a personal tradition. I both competed in my first-ever race in Kenya's oxygen-thin air and stayed at Kenya's national team training camp, which is where the country's top runners prepare for their annual assault on the World Cross-Country Team Championships.
I was invited by Kenya's national team coach when I finished fifth - behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan - in the World Championship 1O,000 meters race. It was an opponunity not to be missed. Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity.
These benefits have been borne out by the successes of generations of Kenyan runners.
My first African race - which came before my spell at the Kenyan team training camp - was also a first for the whole continent. Held in Nairobi, it was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil.
If nothing else, it was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but 3 were Kenyan. And I honestly felt I hadn't had a bad race!
However, I don't believe Kenyan success can entirely be put down to the altitude factor. Kenyan runners are also noted for their refreshingly uncomplicated approach to the sport. While their running style is seemingly effortless, their diet simple and their manner of conversation relaxed, they also seem to love competing.
But the least discussed aspect of the puzzle of Kenyan success was perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp soon provided the answers.
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.
It's a fairly basic affair, though: there are few comforts. The athletes live among the college's regular students and are housed six to a room in cinder-block dormitories.
The athletes' days at the camp are dominated by three work-outs: a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, followed by a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily regime began at six. We crawled from our bunks and assembled to be briefed by the coaches for the morning run.
""Run easy, you have a hard job today"", we were warned as we left by the coach who'd invited me.
The total distance covered each day was about 40 kilometres - a little short of a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, with just the one scheduled run of 20 kilometres, which certainly came as a welcome respite from the rest of the week's three daily work-outs.
Running apart, life was complication-free. A splash of water on the face and a brush of the teeth sufficed for pre-breakfast preparations. Breakfast itself consisted of tea, bread and boiled eggs, taken in a sparsely-lit, small dining area.
Lunch and dinner both had a similar menu: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach and tea. When the day's running was over, in the early evening, we would pile into a car and drive down to bathe properly in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.
By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. That success just can't be attributed to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone.
I couldn't stop myself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps these are the secrets, perhaps these are the real reasons behind Kenya's rise to the top of world distance running.",C1,,"A runner from Britain

Richard Nerurkar is a good British runner. He runs 10,000 metres. He went to a training camp in Kenya. The camp is high up in the mountains.

The camp is near Mount Kenya. It is a beautiful but quiet place. Richard has trained there before. But he never trained with Kenyan runners in Kenya.

On his last trip, he did two new things. He ran his first race in Kenya. The air is thin there. He also stayed at the training camp for Kenya's best runners. They get ready for big races there.

The coach invited him after a race. Richard thought it was a great chance. Training high up helps your body. It makes more red blood cells. This helps you use oxygen better. Kenyan runners are very successful. This training is one reason why.

His first race in Africa was also the first big international cross-country race held there. Many runners were faster than him. Almost all of them were from Kenya. Richard felt he ran well, but it was not easy.

He thinks Kenyan runners are successful for more reasons than just the altitude. They have a simple way of running and living. They eat simple food and are relaxed. They also really love to run and compete.

Richard wanted to know how they train. He found out when he stayed at their camp.

The camp is at a school on Mount Kenya. It is a simple place. The runners live in dormitories with six people in a room.

Every day, they do three runs: an easy run in the morning, a harder run later, and another run in the afternoon. They start at six o'clock. The coach told them to take it easy.

They ran about 40 kilometres every day. That is almost a marathon. On Sunday, they only ran 20 kilometres. This was a nice break.

Life was simple. They washed their face and brushed their teeth. For breakfast, they had tea, bread, and eggs. For lunch and dinner, they ate ugali (a maize food), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea.

After running, they drove to a stream to bathe.

When Richard left, he understood Kenyan success better. It is not just because of where they live or their families.

He thought about a different reason. Maybe the secret is their simple life on the mountain, their very hard training, and their strong wish to win. This is perhaps why Kenya has the best distance runners in the world.","The Long-Distance Runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's best 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyan runners' high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a small mountain track leaves the main road from Nairobi. This path is the beginning of the route up Mount Kenya, the country's highest mountain with glaciers on top. This beautiful but isolated place is called Nanyuki. For the past three years, it has been my base for winter training in Kenya's high mountains.

However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners in their own country before. During my fourth and most recent winter training trip to Kenya, I changed this. I took part in my first race in Kenya's thin mountain air and stayed at the training camp for Kenya's national team. This is where Kenya's top runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Championships.

The national team coach invited me after I finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters. It was an opportunity I could not miss. Training at high altitude helps your body produce more red blood cells, which improves how well you use oxygen.

The success of many Kenyan runners shows that this training really works.

My first race in Africa was also the first international cross-country race ever organized on the continent. It took place in Nairobi.

The race was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished before me, 38 were Kenyan. And I actually felt I had run quite well!

But I believe Kenya's success is not only because of the high altitude. Kenyan runners are also famous for their simple approach to the sport. Their running style looks effortless, they eat basic food, and they speak in a relaxed way. They also clearly enjoy competing.

However, people rarely discuss how Kenyan runners actually train. My stay at their training camp soon gave me the answers.

The national team camp is at St Mark's College, high on the slopes of Mount Kenya. It is surrounded by beautiful sports fields and thick tropical plants.

The camp is very basic and has few comforts. The athletes live with the college students, with six people sharing one room in simple dormitories.

Each day at camp includes three training sessions: a gentle morning run, a harder interval training session later in the morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Our day began at six o'clock. We got out of our beds and gathered to hear the coaches' instructions for the morning run.

""Run easily because you have a difficult session today,"" the coach who invited me warned us as we left.

In total, we ran about 40 kilometres every day, which is almost a marathon. The only exception was Sunday, when we had just one 20-kilometre run. This was a welcome break from the three daily sessions during the rest of the week.

Apart from running, life was very simple. Before breakfast, we just washed our faces and brushed our teeth. Breakfast was tea, bread, and boiled eggs, which we ate in a small, dimly lit dining room.

Lunch and dinner were similar: ugali (a dish made from maize), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. In the early evening, after the final run, we would get into a car and drive to a stream flowing from Mount Kenya's glaciers to bathe properly.

By the time I left the camp, I appreciated Kenyan success even more. It cannot be explained only by genetics, their upbringing, or the high altitude.

I began to think about a different reason: perhaps the secret is their simple mountain lifestyle, their extremely hard training, and their great passion for winning. Maybe this is the real explanation for Kenya's position at the top of world distance running.","The Long-Distance Runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's leading 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyan runners' high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a rough mountain track branches off from the quiet paved road leading from Nairobi. This track marks the beginning of the route up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-covered Mount Kenya. This stunning, though isolated, location is Nanyuki. For the past three years, it has served as my base for high-altitude training during the winter in Kenya's Central Highlands.

Away from the running, life was uncomplicated. Pre-breakfast preparations consisted of splashing water on our faces and brushing our teeth. Breakfast itself was tea, bread, and boiled eggs, consumed in a small, dimly-lit dining area.
Lunch and dinner offered a similar menu: ugali (a maize-based dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After the day's running was over in the early evening, we would all squeeze into a car and drive down to bathe properly in one of the many streams fed by Mount Kenya's shrinking glaciers.
By the time I departed from the camp, my appreciation for Kenyan success had grown even stronger. Their achievements cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone.
I found myself continually reflecting on a rather different explanation: perhaps the secret lies in the purity and simplicity of the mountain lifestyle, these extremely demanding training sessions, and this powerful passion for success.

219,"ECCENTRICS

An eccentric is by definition someone whose behaviour is abnormal, someone who refuses to conform to the accepted norms of his society. This, of course, immediately begs the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us, after all, have our quirks and oddities. It may be a passion for entering newspaper competitions, a compulsion for collecting beer mats, a tendency to write indignant letters to the press on every conceivable subject. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. Within most of us that urge is constantly in conflict with the contrary force. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity and in most of us it is conformity that is the more powerful. The desire to be accepted, loved, appreciated, to feel at one with our fellows, is stronger than the desire to stand out in the crowd, to be our own man, to do our own thing.
Notice, for example, how people who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour, tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems. The important word is 'common'. They look for other people with whom they can share what in the normal run of events is regarded by relatives, friends and neighbours as an oddity. A crowd, even a small crowd, is reassuring.
Probably all of us recognise a tension within ourselves between the two forces of individualism and conformity, for at the same time that most of us are going with the crowd, we tend to resent any suggestion that this is what we are doing. We feel a self-conscious need to assert our individuality as when the belligerent man at the bar informs his small audience, ""Well, I say what I think."" Or the wary stranger to whom we have just been introduced announces, ""You must take me as you find me. I don't stand on ceremony.""
Any of us can, at any time, reverse this trend. We can stoke the boiler of individualism, assert our own personality. Many people have made it to the top in their chosen professions, basically by doing just that. One example is Bob Dylan, the American singer, who has gone on record as saying, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk. But that self-conscious assertion of individuality is not eccentricity, at least not in the early stages. When a pop singer deliberately wears bizarre clothes to gain publicity, or a society hostess makes outrageous comments about her guests in order to get herself noticed in the gossip columns, that is not eccentricity. However, if the pop star and the society hostess perpetuate such activities until they become a part of themselves, until they are no longer able to return to what most of us consider 'normal behaviour', then they certainly would qualify. For the most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics are not people who deliberately try to be odd, they simply are odd.
The true eccentric is not merely indifferent to public opinion, he is scarcely conscious at all. He simply does what he does, because of who he is. And this marks the eccentric as essentially different from, for example, enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists and recluses. These people are all very conscious of the world around them. Much of what they do, they do in reaction to the world in which they live. Some wish to make an impression on society, some wish to escape from society, but all are very much aware of society. The eccentric alone goes on his merry way regardless.",C1,,,"ECCENTRICS

An eccentric is someone who behaves differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us ask: ""What is normal?"" After all, everyone has small strange habits. Maybe someone loves entering competitions in newspapers, or feels they must collect beer mats, or often writes angry letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is a way to show we are all different.

Inside most of us, there are two strong feelings that fight each other. One feeling is the wish to be our own person. The other is the wish to be like others and fit in. For most people, the wish to fit in is stronger. We want to be accepted, liked, and to feel we belong with other people. This is often stronger than the wish to be different and do things our own way.

For example, people with unusual hobbies or strong ideas often meet each other. They start clubs, have meetings, and organize events. There, they can talk about their shared interests. The important idea is 'shared'. They look for other people who like the same things, which their family and friends might think are strange. Being in a group, even a small one, makes them feel better.

Most of us feel this fight inside between being an individual and fitting in. Even when we are following the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We sometimes feel we must show we are different. For example, an angry man in a bar might say, ""I always say what I think."" Or a new person you meet might tell you, ""You have to accept me as I am.""

We can always change this. We can choose to be more individual and show our own personality. Many successful people have done this. One example is the American singer Bob Dylan. He once said that if you really believe in what you are doing and you keep trying, you will confuse many people.

But trying hard to show you are different is not the same as being a true eccentric. If a pop star wears very strange clothes just to get attention, or a famous woman says shocking things to be in the newspapers, that is not eccentricity. However, if they keep doing these things until it becomes a real part of who they are, and they can no longer act in a 'normal' way, then they become eccentrics. The most important part of eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics don't try to be strange; they just are strange.

A true eccentric doesn't care what other people think. In fact, they hardly even notice. They just act the way they do because of who they are. This makes them different from other people, like hobby lovers, people who play tricks, clever criminals, people who show off, or people who live alone. Those people are very aware of the world around them. They often act because of how they see society. Some want to change society, and some want to get away from it. But the eccentric just happily does their own thing, without thinking about society at all.","ECCENTRICS

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual, someone who does not follow the usual rules of their society. This makes us ask, ""What is normal?"" After all, most people have their own small strange habits. It could be a strong interest in entering newspaper contests, a need to collect beer mats, or a habit of writing angry letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is a way of showing we are unique individuals.

Inside most of us, there is a constant struggle between two forces. It is as if we have two trains facing each other on the same track, pushing against one another. One is called individualism and the other is called conformity. For most people, the force of conformity is stronger. The wish to be accepted, loved, and to feel part of a group is stronger than the wish to be different, to be independent, or to do things our own way.

For example, notice how people with unusual hobbies, strong views, or different behavior often come together. They create clubs, have meetings, and organize events where they can meet and talk about their shared interests or problems. The key word is 'shared'. They look for other people who they can share their interest with—an interest that family, friends, and neighbors usually find strange. Being in a group, even a small one, makes them feel more secure.

Most of us probably feel this inner tension between being an individual and fitting in. Even though we often follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We feel a need to show we are unique. For example, an angry man in a bar might tell the people near him, ""I always say what I think."" Or a cautious new acquaintance might say, ""You have to accept me as I am. I'm not formal.""

Any of us can change this at any time. We can choose to be more individual and express our own personality. Many successful people in their jobs have done exactly that. One example is the American singer Bob Dylan, who once said that when you truly believe in what you are doing and you keep going without giving up, you will confuse many people.

But this deliberate effort to show you are different is not true eccentricity, at least not at first. If a pop singer wears very strange clothes just to get attention, or a famous hostess says shocking things about her guests to be mentioned in the news, that is not being eccentric. However, if they continue this behavior until it becomes a real part of who they are, and they can no longer act in a way most people see as 'normal', then they could be called eccentrics. The most important part of eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be strange on purpose; they simply are strange.

A true eccentric does not just ignore what other people think; they hardly even notice it. They simply act according to their own nature. This makes the eccentric fundamentally different from, for example, enthusiasts, practical jokers, clever criminals, people who show off, or people who live alone. All these other types are very aware of the world around them. Much of what they do is a reaction to society. Some want to impress society, some want to escape from it, but they are all very conscious of it. Only the eccentric continues happily on their own path, without thinking about society at all.",,
220,"Photographing People

People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

A. GROUPING PEOPLE

Avoid straight lines in group shots. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels. Otherwise, have some of the group sitting or kneeling at the front so that you can see all the faces, or raise your own viewpoint.

B. POSING FOR PICTURES

People seldom act naturally in front of the camera. Often they stiffen up and the pose becomes rather wooden. Relax your subject by helping him to find a comfortable position. You might suggest he folds his hands or puts them in his pockets.

C. THE RIGHT APPROACH

Never try to pretend that you are not taking a picture of someone when it is clear that you are as this only creates tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to have their picture taken - perhaps after some initial protestations - and are quite flattered by it. But they are likely to become rather self-conscious and you may need to direct them. A picture can be spoiled by the fact that the subject is looking rather aimlessly out of the picture so that the interest lies elsewhere.

D. EYE CONTACT

A picture gains immediate impact if the subject appears to be looking at the viewer of the picture. Ask your subject to look into the lens - not necessarily to smile as well -- and this is the effect you will get. The subject may not be able to do this for too long: he may become self-conscious or be distracted by someone nearby. So remind him once more, just before you release the shutter. Or try saying something funny or unexpected as you take the shot for a genuine reaction rather than a meaningless stare.

E. CANDID CONCENTRATION

An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to concentrate on something within the picture area. Your subject might find this easier to do, and the viewer can follow the attention to another part of the picture. You get the impression that you are observing the subject unnoticed. Candid shots have a special fascination and the subject's expression is vital to the picture.

F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES

Expressions and the gestures that go with them tell us more about the subject of a photograph than anything else. Even if he is obviously badly treated and hungry, a laughing child provokes a smile from the viewer, whereas a sad expression produces a sympathetic sadness in the viewer, however apparently comfortable the subject may be. Look for familiar expressions for your portraits: shrugs, winks, anger, tears, thumbs-up, fist-clenching and so on. They are an instant visual language.

G. SITUATION INTEREST

Though shots which isolate a figure or face prominently have great impact, the subject's background or environment can add extra interest and information about the subject. When using a background in this way, try to exclude details that are not relevant to the subject or blur them by focusing selectively. Make sure that the subject is not overwhelmed by the background - a wide-angle lens will make your subject appear relatively larger by comparison with the background.

H. INTERACTION

Wherever two or more people are talking, arguing, haggling, joking or working together, there are opportunities for good pictures. Couples make appealing shots; so do mothers and babies, teachers and children or teams of people working or playing a sport. Look out especially for contact between the subjects - either eye-contact or physical contact, like a protective hand on the arm or a handshake. Or show how one is reacting to another by waiting for an animated expression or telling gesture.

I. PEOPLE AND PLACES

Many pictures of people are taken on holiday or during an outing - partly to show the place they were visiting. A little care will greatly improve this type of picture. To show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building (or mountain, or lake) in the frame. Ask your subjects to come fairly close to the camera and compose the picture so that the group forms a foreground interest without obscuring the background. If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be far easier to do. A good picture will show a balance between the subjects and the place they were visiting, so that both claim an equal share of the viewer's attention.

J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?

In answer to this question, first decide why you want to take the picture. If you are taking a picture to remember someone by someone you may have met briefly on holiday, for example - then you will want a good clear picture and it would be worth asking the subject to pose against a well-chosen background. Pictures of the family, on the other hand, can be very tedious if they are a succession of formal poses in front of places of interest. Candid pictures of events as they happen are far more lively, and you are more likely to get unselfconscious shots when you know the subject well. A picture taken on the spur of the moment will jog the family memory in future years far better than a posed portrait.",C1,"Taking Photos of People

People are very interesting to take photos of. A photo with a person in it is often better than a photo without a person. But people can be hard to take photos of. You need to think about how they stand, move, and look. Sometimes, when people see a camera, they act differently.

A. Photos of Groups

In group photos, don't put people in a straight line. Ask them to stand in different places. Some can stand, some can sit, and some can kneel. This way, you can see all their faces.

B. People in Photos

People often feel shy in front of a camera. They can look stiff. Help them feel relaxed. Tell them to put their hands in their pockets or to fold their arms.

C. How to Ask

Always tell people you want to take their photo. Don't hide the camera. Most people will say yes. They might feel happy about it. Tell them where to look so they don't look away from the camera.

D. Looking at the Camera

A photo is better when the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They don't have to smile. Just before you take the photo, ask them to look at the camera again. Or say something funny to get a real smile.

E. Looking at Something Else

Sometimes, the person can look at something in the photo. This can be easier for them. The person looking at the photo will see what they are looking at. This makes the photo feel more natural.

F. Faces and Hands

A person's face and hands can show how they feel. A happy child makes us smile. A sad person makes us feel sad. Look for common things like a smile, a wave, or a thumbs-up.

G. The Place in the Photo

The place behind the person can make the photo more interesting. But make sure the place is not too busy. The person should be the main thing in the photo.

H. People Together

When two or more people are talking, working, or playing, it is a good time for a photo. Look for people looking at each other or touching, like holding hands. Wait for them to laugh or talk to get a good photo.

I. People and Places

We often take photos of people on holiday. To get a good photo, stand back so you can see the person and the place, like a building or a mountain. Ask the people to stand near the camera. The place and the people should both be important in the photo.

J. To Pose or Not to Pose?

First, think about why you want the photo. If you want a clear photo of someone you just met, ask them to stand in a nice place. For family photos, it is often better to take photos when people are not posing. Photos of people doing things are more fun and help you remember the day better.","**Taking Pictures of People**

People are very interesting to take pictures of. A photo with a person is usually better than one without a person. But people can be hard to photograph. You need to watch what the person is doing. Sometimes, the camera makes people act in a strange way.

**A. Groups of People**
For group photos, do not put people in one line. Ask them to stand in different places. Some can stand, some can sit, and some can kneel. This way you can see all the faces. Or you can stand on a chair to take the photo.

**B. Posing for Photos**
People often look stiff in photos. Help them feel relaxed. Tell them to stand in a comfortable way. You can say, ""Put your hands in your pockets.""

**C. How to Ask**
Always tell people you are taking their photo. If you hide it, they can feel bad. Most people will say yes. They often like it. But they may not know what to do, so you should tell them. A photo is not good if the person is looking away.

**D. Looking at the Camera**
A photo is better if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the camera. They do not need to smile. Just before you take the photo, say ""Look here!"" Or say something funny to get a real smile.

**E. Looking at Something Else**
Another way is for the person to look at something in the picture. This is easier for them. The person who sees the photo will look at that thing too. It seems like you are watching the person without them knowing. These natural photos are very good.

**F. Faces and Hands**
A person's face and hands tell us how they feel. A happy child makes us happy. A sad person makes us sad. Look for things like a smile, a wave, or a thumbs-up. They are like a simple language.

**G. The Place Behind the Person**
A photo of a person's face is strong. But the place behind them can be interesting too. It can tell us about the person. Do not let other things in the background take attention. Make sure the person is the main part of the photo.

**H. People with Other People**
When people are talking or playing, it is a good time for a photo. Photos of two people, a mother and baby, or a sports team are nice. Look for people looking at each other or touching. Wait for a happy face or a hand movement.

**I. People and Places**
We take photos of people on holiday to remember the place. To make a good photo, step back. You need to see the whole building or mountain. Ask the people to stand near the camera. You should see the people in the front and the place behind them. If you stand on something higher, it is easier. A good photo shows the people and the place well.

**J. Posed or Natural Photos?**
First, think why you want the photo. If you want a clear picture of someone new, ask them to stand in a nice spot. But for family, many formal photos are boring. Photos of real moments are more fun. When you know the person, it is easier to get natural photos. A photo from a happy time will help you remember better than a posed picture.","Taking Pictures of People

People are the most interesting things to take pictures of. A photo with a person in it is usually more interesting than the same photo without a person. But people can also be the hardest to photograph well. The photographer needs to think about the person's actions, movements, and face. Sometimes, just having a camera there can make people act differently.

**A. Taking Photos of Groups**

In group photos, don't put people in a straight line. Ask them to stand in different ways and at different distances. If you can, have some people sit or kneel in the front so you can see everyone's face. Or, you can stand somewhere higher.

**B. Posing for Photos**

People often act strangely when a camera is on them. They can become stiff. Help your subject to relax by finding a comfortable position. You could tell them to put their hands together or in their pockets.

**C. How to Act**

Don't pretend you are not taking a photo when you clearly are. This can make people feel nervous or even angry. Most people will say yes if you ask to take their picture. They might even feel happy about it. But they might not know what to do, so you may need to tell them how to stand or look. A photo can be bad if the person is looking away from the camera, because our eyes will follow where they are looking.

**D. Looking at the Camera**

A photo is more powerful if the person is looking straight at the camera. Ask your subject to look into the camera lens. They don't always have to smile. They might find this hard to do for a long time, so remind them just before you take the photo. You could also say something funny to get a real, natural reaction from them.

**E. Looking at Something Else**

Another good idea is for the person to be looking at something else in the picture. The person might find this easier. Then, the person looking at the photo will also look at what the subject is looking at. It feels like you are watching the person without them knowing. These natural photos are very interesting, and the person's expression is very important.

**F. Faces and Body Language**

A person's face and body tell us a lot about them. For example, a happy child makes us smile, but a sad person makes us feel sad. Look for common expressions like a shrug, a wink, or a thumbs-up. These are like a language we can all understand.

**G. The Background**

A photo of just a person's face can be very strong. But the place behind the person can also add interest and tell us more about them. When you use a background, try to avoid things that are not important. Make sure the person is the main focus of the picture and not the background.

**H. People Together**

When two or more people are talking, working, or playing, it's a great chance for a good photo. Photos of couples, mothers with babies, or teams are often nice. Look for people making eye contact or touching, like a hand on an arm. Or, wait for one person to react to another with a strong expression.

**I. People in Places**

We often take photos of people on holiday to remember the place. To make these photos better, step back so you can get the whole building or view in the picture. Ask the people to stand close to the camera. The group should be in the front of the picture but not block the background. If you can stand a little higher, it will be easier. A good photo will show both the people and the place equally well.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**

First, think about why you are taking the photo. If you want a clear picture of someone you just met, it is a good idea to ask them to pose in front of a nice background. But for family photos, too many posed pictures in front of famous places can be boring. Photos of things happening naturally are more fun. It is easier to get natural photos of people you know well. A photo taken quickly of a real moment will help you remember that day much better than a formal, posed picture.","Taking Pictures of People

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture that includes a person is almost always more engaging than the same scene without anyone in it. However, people are also the most challenging subjects to photograph well. Besides thinking about technical and artistic choices, the photographer must pay attention to the person's movements, body language, and facial expressions. Often, the camera itself can make people act differently, which can ruin the photo.

A. PHOTOGRAPHING GROUPS

In group photos, avoid having people stand in a straight line. Instead, ask them to stand at different angles and distances from the camera. If you can, have them stand on different levels. Another option is to have some people sit or kneel in the front so that everyone's face is visible. You could also try taking the photo from a higher position.

B. POSING FOR PHOTOS

People often act unnaturally when they know a camera is pointing at them. They can become stiff and their pose may look awkward. Help your subject relax by suggesting a comfortable position. For example, you could tell them to put their hands in their pockets or to fold their arms.

C. HOW TO APPROACH PEOPLE

Don't pretend you are not taking someone's photo when it is obvious that you are. This can make people feel tense or even angry. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they say no at first, and they often feel pleased about it. However, they might become shy, so you may need to guide them. A photo can be ruined if the subject is looking away from the camera, making the viewer lose interest.

D. MAKING EYE CONTACT

A photo becomes more powerful if the person in it is looking directly at the camera. Ask your subject to look into the lens. They don't necessarily have to smile. The person might not be able to keep looking at the lens for a long time because they feel shy or get distracted. Just before you take the photo, remind them to look at the camera. You could also say something funny or surprising to get a real reaction instead of a blank stare.

E. NATURAL CONCENTRATION

Instead of looking at the camera, the subject can focus on something within the scene. People often find this easier, and it guides the viewer's attention to another part of the photo. This creates the feeling that you are watching the person without them knowing. These natural, unposed photos are very appealing, and the person's expression is extremely important.

F. FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND BODY LANGUAGE

A person's expression and gestures tell us more about them than anything else in a photo. For example, a laughing child makes the viewer smile, even if the child is in a difficult situation. A sad expression makes the viewer feel sympathy, even if the person seems comfortable. Look for common expressions and gestures for your portraits, like a shrug, a wink, anger, or a thumbs-up. These act like a visual language.

G. USING THE BACKGROUND

Photos that focus only on a person's face can be very strong, but the background can also add interest and information about the subject. When you include a background, try to leave out details that are not important, or make them blurry by focusing on the person. Make sure the background doesn't take attention away from the subject. Using a wide-angle lens can help your subject look larger compared to the background.

H. CAPTURING INTERACTION

Good photo opportunities happen when two or more people are talking, arguing, joking, or working together. Pictures of couples, mothers with babies, teachers with children, or sports teams are often very appealing. Look for moments of connection between people, like eye contact or physical touch, such as a hand on an arm or a handshake. You can also wait for one person to react to another with an expressive face or a clear gesture.

I. PEOPLE AND LOCATIONS

Many photos of people are taken on holiday or during trips, often to show the place they visited. With a little planning, you can make these photos much better. To show people with a famous building or a beautiful landscape, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back far enough to include the whole scene. Ask your subjects to stand quite close to the camera and arrange the photo so the group is in the foreground without hiding the background. Taking the photo from a slightly higher position can make this easier. A good photo will create a balance between the people and the place, so both are equally interesting to the viewer.

J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?

To answer this, first think about why you are taking the photo. If you want a clear picture of someone you just met, for example on holiday, it is a good idea to ask them to pose against a nice background. On the other hand, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses in front of tourist spots. Natural photos of events as they happen are much more lively. You are more likely to get relaxed photos when you know the subject well. A photo taken spontaneously will help your family remember the moment much better than a formal, posed picture.",,

Their lives are shattered when the teenage Leo viciously attacks Harriets son, Joe, in the street. After the court case both boys refuse to talk about what happened. Leo, who had been a model pupil and had never been involved in a fight before, will not explain what came over him, while Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is tortured by the effect on her son and ministering to him takes over her life. Sheila is so wracked with guilt that she requests a meeting - from which their unusual friendship grows.

By the end of the book, Aurora is forced to acknowledge the passage of time that brings a new generation to centre stage.
The author is skilful at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events.

222,"The day I drew Picasso

Richard Cork recalls how, as an 78-year-old student, he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century.

Even seen at a distance, eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour, Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student, filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. Having run out of money, I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront. But I spent much of the time drawing, and was lucky enough to be carrying an ample sketchbook when my encounter with the octogenarian artist took place.
Picasso was known to be a fairly reclusive figure who spent most of his time shut away working high in the hills. So I was doubly astonished to find him seated at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three companions. Without my friend's prompting, I would never have dared to walk over and ask for his signature. Nor did I imagine, as I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, that he would comply.
But my request was generously granted. Taking the large sheet I passed over, Picasso inscribed his name across the top of the paper. Then, as if unable to resist the blankness below, he added an exuberant linear flourish on the rest of the page. But Pcasso's art, even at its least representational, was usually anchored in observed reality. So the curves may well refer to a cloud, the wind-rippled sea or the shape assumed by Cannes harbour, dominating his lunchtime vantage point.
Delighted, I thanked him and embarked on a halting conversation. Since Picasso's English was even poorer than my French, an extravagantly dressed American woman at the table acted as our interpreter. She kept describing him as the Maestro, and it was difficult to combat her gushing interjections. But I did manage to tell Picasso of my voracious interest in art and my admiration for his work.
After a while, I resumed to the boat and proudly displayed the fruit of my visit. But the friend who had encouraged me to introduce myself to Picasso could see that the lunch party was still in progress. 'Is that all?' he asked, looking at the signature. 'Why on earth don't you go back and make the most of it? You won't get a chance like this again - and he probably wouldn't mind if you drew his portrait.'
Sketchbook under arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it wise not to ask him whether he'd mind having his portrait drawn: a refusal at this stage might have wrecked the whole delicate enterprise. So I simply stood by the table, propped my pad against an ironwork screen, got out a stick of crayon and stayed to draw.
Once he noticed, Picasso grinned like an imp and made my task wickedly difficult. He acted out a range of expressions, both ridiculous and macabre - rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue and brandishing his hand in fantastical shapes on either side of his forehead. The entire performance was carried out with the gusto of an instinctive clown.
I was tempted to give up the struggle, but the sheer high spirits of my playful sitter seemed tantamount to a challenge. However obstructive his antics, I felt that he was testing my persistence, in order, perhaps, to discover the true extent of my determination.
As if to bear this out, Picasso at last relented and lapsed into repose. For a few extraordinary minutes, he deliberately gave me the chance to study him without impediment. I noticed how tough and alert he appeared, still taut in a blue-and-white striped jersey. As compact as a wrestler, the deeply tanned figure resembled an athletic 60-year-old rather than a man who would soon be celebrating his 84th birthday.
I marvelled at the youthfulness of his clear, dark eyes, set with startling intensity in features remarkably unencumbered by the folds of slack flesh on so many elderly faces. The eyes were mesmerising, and I tried to give them the necessary forcefulness. After fastening themselves on whatever they wanted to scrutinise, they did not blink until the unwavering gaze moved elsewhere.
He also seemed curiously removed and alone, even though there was plenty of company nearby. His engaging burst of buffoonery could not disguise an underlying gravity of spirit. Content to let his friends do most of the talking, he sat in a very private and absorbed silence, pursuing his own isolated interests undisturbed.
When the American lady told me that the Maestro wanted to see his portrait, I became embarrassed and replied that it wasn't good enough to show him. Picasso insisted, however, and after I passed my sketchbook over, he gave my efforts a generous nod.
Then, to my astonishment, he announced that it was now his turn. I lost no time in giving him my crayon, and his hand applied a few swift, decisive strokes to the paper. In a matter of seconds, with beguiling assurance, he outlined a bearded face below the head which had taken me so many anxious minutes to produce.
He handed the pad back, and there was a drawing blithely at odds with my dogged strivings. Picasso had moved one eye onto my nose, and summarised my smile in a single, irresistibly vivacious line. I looked like a creature who had strayed from one of his more lighthearted mythological compositions. Perhaps he saw me as an intruder from another world, peering in at him with all the gauche curiosity of a young man amazed to find himself face-to-face with an artist he venerated.
I thanked Picasso, and asked him if he would be kind enough to sign the drawing. After consultation, the American explained that the Maestro says you already have his signature. So there were limits to the generosity he was prepared to bestow on me!
All the same, I look back now and wonder at my good fortune. Meeting Picasso and, more important, receiving his attention meant an enormous amount to me.",C1,,"The Day I Drew Picasso

Richard Cork remembers when he was a young student and met the famous artist Picasso.

I saw Picasso eating lunch outside by the sea in Cannes. I was 18 years old. I was traveling in Europe and Morocco in an old van before I started university. I had no money, so I got a job painting boats. But I liked to draw, and I had a big book for my pictures. I was lucky to have it when I met the old artist.

People said Picasso liked to be alone and work in his house in the hills. So I was very surprised to see him at a table with his wife and friends. My friend told me to go and ask for his name. I was nervous, but I walked over and gave him my book.

He was very nice. He wrote his name on the paper. Then he drew a happy, wavy line on the rest of the page. His art was often about real things. Maybe the lines were a cloud, the sea, or the harbour.

I was very happy. I thanked him and tried to talk to him. Picasso did not speak English well, and my French was bad. A woman at the table helped us talk. She called him ""Maestro."" I told him I loved art and his work.

Later, I went back to the boat and showed my friend the drawing. My friend saw that Picasso was still eating. ""Is that all?"" he asked. ""Go back and draw his picture. You will not get another chance.""

I went back to the table with my book. I did not ask if I could draw him. I thought he might say no. So I stood near the table, put my paper against a wall, and started to draw.

When he saw me, Picasso smiled and made it hard for me. He made funny faces. He moved his eyes and put out his tongue. He moved his hands near his head. He was like a funny clown.

I almost stopped, but I felt he was testing me. I thought he wanted to see if I would keep trying.

Then he stopped and sat quietly. For a few minutes, I could look at him easily. He looked strong and awake. He wore a blue and white shirt. He was small but strong, like a younger man.

His dark eyes were young and full of life. They looked at things and did not blink. He seemed like he was thinking his own thoughts, even with his friends around. His funny acting could not hide his serious mind.

The woman told me that Picasso wanted to see the picture. I was shy and said it was not good. But he asked to see it, so I gave him my book. He looked at it and nodded.

Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my pencil. In just a few seconds, he drew a face with a beard under the head I had drawn.

He gave the book back to me. His drawing was very different from mine. He put one eye on my nose and drew my smile with one happy line. I looked like a person from one of his fun stories. Maybe he saw me as a visitor from another world, a young man who was happy to meet an artist he liked.

I thanked him and asked him to write his name on the new drawing. The woman said, ""The Maestro says you already have his name."" So he would not give me another one.

Even so, I now think about that day and feel very lucky. Meeting Picasso and having him look at me was very important.","The day I drew Picasso

Richard Cork remembers how, as an 18-year-old student, he met one of the most famous artists of the century.

Even from far away, while eating lunch at a restaurant by the sea in Cannes, Picasso was easy to recognise. I was an 18-year-old student, travelling around Europe and Morocco in an old van before starting university. I had no money left, so I found a job painting boats near the water. But I spent most of my time drawing, and I was lucky to have a big sketchbook with me when I met the old artist.

Picasso usually stayed alone, working in his house in the hills. So I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three other people. Without my friend telling me to, I would never have walked over and asked for his signature. I also didn't think he would agree when I nervously introduced myself and gave him my sketchbook.

But he kindly said yes. He took the big piece of paper I gave him and wrote his name at the top. Then, as if he couldn't stop himself, he drew a lively, curving line across the rest of the page. Even when Picasso's art didn't look like real things, it was often based on what he saw. So the curves might show a cloud, the wavy sea, or the shape of Cannes harbour, which he could see from his table.

I was very happy and thanked him. We tried to talk, but it was difficult. Picasso's English was worse than my French, so a well-dressed American woman at the table helped us understand each other. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" and it was hard to stop her from talking so much. But I did tell Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work.

After a while, I went back to the boat and showed my friend the drawing. But my friend saw that Picasso and his group were still eating. ""Is that all?"" he asked, looking at the signature. ""Why don't you go back and do more? You won't get another chance like this—and he probably wouldn't mind if you drew a picture of him.""

With my sketchbook under my arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was better not to ask if I could draw him, in case he said no. So I just stood near the table, put my pad against a metal screen, took out a crayon, and started to draw.

When he noticed, Picasso smiled like a playful child and made it very hard for me. He made funny and strange faces—rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue, and moving his hands in odd shapes near his head. He did it all with the energy of a natural clown.

I almost stopped, but his playful mood felt like a challenge. Even though he was being difficult, I felt he was testing how determined I was.

Then, as if to prove this, Picasso finally became still. For a few amazing minutes, he let me look at him without any problems. I saw how strong and awake he looked, wearing a blue and white striped shirt. He was small and strong like a wrestler, and he seemed more like a fit 60-year-old than a man who would soon be 84.

I was amazed by how young his dark eyes looked. They were very clear and full of life, unlike the eyes of many old people. His eyes were fascinating, and I tried to draw them with the right strength. When he looked at something, he didn't blink until he looked away.

He also seemed quiet and alone, even with people around him. His funny behaviour couldn't hide a serious side. He let his friends do most of the talking and sat quietly, thinking his own thoughts.

When the American woman told me that the Maestro wanted to see his portrait, I felt shy and said it wasn't good enough. But Picasso insisted, so I gave him my sketchbook. He looked at my drawing and nodded kindly.

Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and with a few fast, sure lines, he drew a face with a beard below the head I had worked so hard on.

He gave the pad back to me, and the drawing was very different from my careful work. Picasso had moved one eye onto my nose and drew my smile with one lively line. I looked like a character from one of his happy mythical paintings. Maybe he saw me as someone from another world, looking at him with the awkward curiosity of a young man who couldn't believe he was meeting an artist he admired so much.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign the drawing. After talking with the American woman, she said, ""The Maestro says you already have his signature."" So there was a limit to how much he would give me!

Still, when I think about it now, I feel very lucky. Meeting Picasso and, more importantly, having his attention, meant so much to me.","The Day I Drew Picasso

Richard Cork remembers how, as an 18-year-old student, he encountered one of the most respected artists of the century.

Even from a distance, while eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes harbour, Picasso was immediately recognizable. I was an 18-year-old student, spending time before university by travelling through Europe and Morocco in an old, unreliable van. Having spent all my money, I found work painting boats along the waterfront. But I devoted most of my time to drawing, and fortunately had a large sketchbook with me when I met the elderly artist.

Picasso had a reputation for being quite private, usually working alone in his hilltop home. I was therefore extremely surprised to find him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three companions. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have approached him to request his signature. I also never expected that he would agree when I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook.

However, he generously accepted my request. Taking the large sheet of paper I handed him, Picasso signed his name across the top. Then, as if unable to resist the empty space below, he added an energetic, flowing line across the rest of the page. Even when Picasso's art wasn't realistic, it usually reflected things he observed. The curves might have represented a cloud, the wind-blown sea, or the shape of Cannes harbour, which dominated his view during lunch.

Delighted, I thanked him and began a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was even worse than my French, a flamboyantly dressed American woman at the table translated for us. She repeatedly referred to him as ""the Maestro,"" and it was challenging to interrupt her enthusiastic comments. Nevertheless, I managed to tell Picasso about my intense interest in art and my admiration for his work.

After some time, I returned to the boat and proudly showed my friend what I had obtained. However, my friend noticed that Picasso's lunch party was still continuing. ""Is that all?"" he asked, examining the signature. ""Why don't you go back and make the most of this opportunity? You'll never get another chance like this - and he probably wouldn't mind if you drew his portrait.""

Carrying my sketchbook, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided it was wiser not to ask permission to draw him, thinking a refusal might ruin the delicate situation. Instead, I simply stood near the table, leaned my pad against a metal screen, took out a crayon, and began drawing.

Once he noticed me, Picasso grinned mischievously and made my task extremely difficult. He performed a series of expressions, both comical and strange - rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue, and shaping his hands into fantastic forms beside his head. His entire performance was conducted with the energy of a natural entertainer.

I considered giving up, but his playful behavior seemed like a direct challenge. However disruptive his antics, I felt he was testing my determination, perhaps to see how serious I was about drawing him.

As if confirming my suspicion, Picasso finally relaxed and became still. For several extraordinary minutes, he deliberately allowed me to study him without interruption. I observed how strong and alert he appeared, still fit in his blue-and-white striped shirt. Compact like a wrestler, his deeply tanned figure resembled an athletic 60-year-old rather than someone approaching his 84th birthday.

I was struck by the youthfulness of his clear, dark eyes, which held remarkable intensity in a face surprisingly free of the wrinkles common in older people. His eyes were mesmerizing, and I tried to capture their powerful quality in my drawing. When they focused on something, they remained unblinking until his attention shifted elsewhere.

He also seemed strangely distant and solitary, despite being surrounded by company. His entertaining clowning couldn't completely conceal a more serious nature. Content to let his friends dominate the conversation, he sat in private silence, pursuing his own thoughts undisturbed.

When the American woman informed me that the Maestro wanted to see his portrait, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn't good enough to show him. However, Picasso insisted, and when I handed him my sketchbook, he gave my work an approving nod.

Then, to my astonishment, he announced it was his turn to draw. I immediately gave him my crayon, and his hand moved quickly across the paper with confident strokes. In just seconds, with captivating assurance, he outlined a bearded face beneath the head that had taken me many anxious minutes to complete.

He returned the pad, revealing a drawing that contrasted completely with my careful efforts. Picasso had placed one eye on my nose and captured my smile with a single, wonderfully lively line. I resembled a character from one of his more playful mythological works. Perhaps he saw me as an intruder from another world, observing him with the awkward curiosity of a young man amazed to find himself facing an artist he deeply admired.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would kindly sign the drawing. After consulting with the American woman, she explained that the Maestro said I already had his signature. Apparently, there were limits to the generosity he was willing to extend!

Nevertheless, when I look back now, I appreciate my extraordinary good fortune. Meeting Picasso and, more importantly, receiving his attention meant an enormous amount to me.",,
223,"P. D. James

Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer, whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination.

Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her, had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase, as a headmistress of a girls' school. But it is soon apparent from what she says that the authoritative mien is, in fact, a cloak for shyness. She reluctantly admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her novels, 'is, I suppose, modelled on myself - or rather, the way I would have turned out if I had been a man'. Dalgliesh prefers to unravel the complexities of crimes solo, as does his creator. 'I need time on my own, particularly when I am writing. I can write more or less anywhere as long as I have total privacy.'
She is too modest to concur with the view that she is Britain's best-known crime writer, even though her books - 12 major detective novels - are read avidly by millions all over the world. She herself is a great fan of the works of close friend Ruth Rendell. 'I particularly enjoy her psychological works, written under the name of Barbara Vine.' Books beside her bed are most likely to be by women writers such as Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner and Penelope Lively, although not to the total exclusion of male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers to have been the greatest novelists of their generation.
Success came to P.D. James late in life. Now in her seventies, she was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. Born in Oxford, the eldest of three children, Phyllis grew up mainly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11 years old. 'I met my husband there - he was a student at the university, and I have always loved the place. That is why I chose it as the setting for An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.'
Reluctantly, she reveals that from a promising start, life has been hard, even tragic at times. Her Irish doctor husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from the Second World War, during which he served with the Royal Army Medical
Corps, a very sick man. 'I had to work long hours to support him and our two young daughters, Clare and Jane. The ideas were teeming in my head, but I could do practically nothing about it - I simply hadn't the time. My husband's parents, however, were marvellous, and took my daughters under their wing, giving them a sense of security throughout those difficult years.'
While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she made good use of her enviable organisational skills. At one point, five psychiatric outpatients' clinics came under her jurisdiction. Then followed 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department, doing administration for forensic science research, and then in the Criminal Law section, in the juvenile crime division. It was while working in forensic science that she became 'quite accustomed' to the sight of corpses. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. 'It was, rather, the shape and construction involved in the writing of a crime novel that appealed. I have always enjoyed reading detective stories, and I always knew that I wanted to be a writer.'
'I didn't want to use the traumatic events of my own life in a work of fiction. The writing of a detective story appealed as a wonderful apprenticeship for someone setting out to be a serious novelist, and it was suitably remove from my own experience. As I went on, I became increasingly aware that one could stay within the constraints and indeed within the so-called formula of the classic detective story and still write a good, serious and revealing novel about human beings. Writing detective stories', she says, 'is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life - even If that life ls unlovable. Nobody really likes violence.'",C1,"P. D. James is a famous writer. She writes crime books. She looks quiet, but she has a big imagination.

224,"We changed lives for a day!

Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant and entertainment complex.

A. Amanda's story

I'd never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else!
I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first!
By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I'd remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated.
After a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say 'Pardon?', which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day!
I never realised how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shrinking violets, but in fact you definitely need to be quite bubbly, as well having the ability to keep a cool head and deal with what is known in the trade as a 'high-volume experience' - in other words, lots of customers!
I'm really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets chaotically busy. I wasn't too impressed with the pay either. Unfortunately, I must have been a lousy waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me a bean!
I must admit I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing!

B. Cindy's story

I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I'd been warned the girls were cheeky, but in my ignorance I thought I could handle it. Little did I know!
As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house and do the washing.
At 1 pm I picked up Katie, whizzed around the supermarket and then took her home for lunch. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could! I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!
After much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink, for heaven's sake? Of course, I realised it was just a ploy so they could come downstairs and watch television, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating deals with them.
I never realised how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sheer sense of responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.

Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school.

C. Rosemary's story

On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was pure luxury! But I dithered for ages about how to look. I could hardly turn up in overalls and boots, could I?
Looking at a sea of faces -- about 400 pupils -- at assembly, I hoped I melted into the background and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm.
After that it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables in unison! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails.
By lunchtime I was exhausted and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials.
Alter lunch there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practise on me, which really showed up my rusty French.
Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.
The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming, anyway!

D. Hilary's story

I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she manufactures ice-cream, yoghurt and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! At lunchtime it was time to inspect the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe which had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over they could die, so they have to he checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter!
Alter feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year!
I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't answer back! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year.
Farming seems romantic but the reality is very different. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.",C1,,"We changed lives for one day!

Have you ever wanted to be someone else for a day? Maybe you want to try something new? We helped four people do this. Read their stories.

Amanda (23) is a mother with two young girls. She swapped with her friend Cindy (30). Cindy works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.

**A. Amanda's story**

I had never been to a place like this before. It was very dark and loud. There were so many people and it felt exciting. It was very different from my quiet town. I thought, ""Can I do this?"" Being a mother is busy, but this was different!

First, I had to learn to carry a drink tray with one hand. The other waitresses did it easily. But when I tried, the drinks fell on the floor. I felt silly, but the other waitresses just laughed. They said everyone makes mistakes at first.

At 11:30, people were waiting outside. I felt nervous. I was worried about remembering orders, but a machine helped with that.

After two hours, my feet hurt. The music was always loud. I often had to say ""Pardon?"" to customers. I was very tired by 5 pm. I just wanted to put my feet in hot water. Another waitress said it was a ""quiet"" day. I was surprised!

I never knew waitressing was so tiring. You need to be friendly and calm with many customers.

I am a shy person. I could not work on a Saturday night when it is very busy. The pay was not great. I was not a good waitress. Even rich customers did not give me extra money.

I was very happy to go back to my children. It feels easier than waitressing!

**B. Cindy's story**

I was a little nervous about being a ""mum"" for the day, but I was also excited. Amanda said her girls could be difficult, but I thought I could manage them. I was wrong!

After Amanda left for the restaurant, I dressed and fed the two girls. I took Sophie to school and Katie to nursery. I thought I would have three quiet hours. Wrong! A note from Amanda said I needed to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie. We went to the supermarket and then home for lunch. But the real trouble started when Sophie came home from school. The girls jumped on the sofa and screamed very loudly. I thought they would get tired soon. Wrong again! I thought I had a lot of energy, but they had more!

At 8 pm, I finally got them to bed. But then they kept asking for glasses of water. I knew they just wanted to come downstairs and watch TV. It was tiring to talk to them all evening.

I never knew looking after two small children was so tiring. You have no time for yourself. It is a big responsibility. But I still had a good day.

Rosemary (42) has a farm with cows and sheep. She swapped with Hilary (30), a primary school teacher.

**C. Rosemary's story**

On my farm, I get up at 5:30 am. So, waking up at 7 am felt like a holiday! I thought for a long time about what to wear. I could not go to school in my farm clothes!

At school, I saw about 400 children. I hoped no one noticed me. I hoped my red face didn't show I was from a farm.

Then, I went to a maths class. The children worked in small groups. This was different from my school days. Later, I helped with a nature project. We looked at different snails.

By lunch, I was very tired. I wanted a long break, but the teachers only have five minutes to eat. They have a lot of work. I went to a teacher meeting and helped with sports trials.

After lunch, the children read quietly. That was nice! Then, we had a French lesson. The children wanted to talk to me in French. My French is not very good.

Finally, we had sports in the hall. I was very tired, but the children had lots of energy.

The hardest part was talking in front of the class. Even for two minutes, it was scary. Teachers have more holidays, but I like farming more.

**D. Hilary's story**

I arrived at the farm at 8:30 am. I was early, but Rosemary had been awake for three hours! Her farm is big. She has 100 cows, 15 young cows, and 800 sheep. She makes milk, ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell.

In the morning, I worked in the ice cream shop. I put milk into bottles and ice cream into boxes. I put labels on them. It was hard not to eat the ice cream!

At lunchtime, I went to check the sheep. I drove to a field and helped a sheep that had fallen. If a sheep falls and no one helps it for 12 hours, it can die. They must be checked every day. This must be hard in winter!

After I fed the young cows, I helped milk the cows. It took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this two times every day, all year.

I felt a little lonely. I missed the children from my school. Animals don't talk to you! The worst part is you can never leave the work. The cows must be milked twice a day, so it is hard to have a holiday. Rosemary will only have about three days off this year.

Farming seems nice, but it is hard work. The money is not always the same. I would not like to depend on the weather.","We changed lives for one day!

Have you ever wanted to trade lives with someone for a day? Maybe you think it would be fun to do something completely different? We arranged this for four people. Read about their day.

Amanda (23), a young mother with two girls, swapped with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress in a busy London restaurant.

**A. Amanda's story**

I had never been to a place like this before. I was surprised by how dark and loud it was. There were so many people and the feeling was exciting. It was very different from my quiet town, and honestly, I didn't know if I could manage! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was something new.

I only had fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was learning, the drinks fell off the tray and onto the floor. Cocktails went everywhere. I felt very silly, but the other waitresses just laughed. They said everyone makes mistakes at the beginning!

When the restaurant opened at 11:30 am, there was already a line of people outside. I started to feel very nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but that was not a problem because a computer did it for me.

After two hours, my feet hurt a lot. I also couldn't get used to the loud music. Every time a customer talked to me, I had to say ""Pardon?"" I felt so embarrassed! My work finished at 5 pm. I was completely tired and just wanted to put my feet in hot water. I was shocked when a waitress told me it had been a ""quiet"" day!

I never knew waitressing was so tiring. I always thought it was a job for quiet people, but you actually need to be friendly and stay calm when it's very busy with lots of customers.

I am a shy person, and I don't think I could work on a Saturday night when it's really crazy. I also wasn't happy with the money. I think I was a bad waitress because even the rich American customers didn't leave me a tip!

I was very happy to go back to my children. It seems much easier after being a waitress!

**B. Cindy's story**

I was a little nervous about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was also excited. Amanda told me her girls could be naughty, but I thought I could manage them. I was wrong!

After Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to dress the two girls and give them breakfast. I took Sophie to school and Katie to nursery. Then I thought I would have three quiet hours. I was wrong again! Amanda left a note that said I had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the washing.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But the real trouble started when I brought Sophie home from school. They jumped on the sofa and played a game where they screamed as loud as they could! I decided to be relaxed and thought they would get tired soon. Wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they had much more than me!

After a long time, I got them into bed by about 8 pm. But then they kept asking for glasses of water! I knew it was just a trick to come downstairs and watch TV. It was tiring to talk with them all evening.

I never knew that looking after two small children could be so tiring. You don't have a single moment for yourself, and the responsibility is huge. But, I really enjoyed the day.

Rosemary (42) has a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a primary school teacher.

**C. Rosemary's story**

On my farm, I get up at 5:30 am, so waking up at 7 am felt like a holiday! But I spent a long time deciding what to wear. I couldn't go to school in my farm clothes, could I?

At the school meeting, I saw about 400 children. I hoped I looked normal and that my red face from being outside didn't make me look different.

Next, I went to a maths class. The children worked in small groups with cards of different difficulty levels. This was very different from my school days when we all said the times tables together. Then I helped with a nature project. We identified different types of snails and fed them.

By lunchtime, I was very tired and wanted a break. But the teachers only have about five minutes to eat because there is so much work to do. I went to a teacher's meeting about student reports and then helped with sports trials.

After lunch, there was a quiet reading lesson – it was lovely! Then there was a French lesson. This was fun because all the children wanted to talk to me in French. It showed that my French is not very good anymore.

Finally, we went to the hall for PE. I was completely drained of energy, but the children seemed to have endless energy.

The most difficult part of the job was talking in front of the class. Even for two minutes, it was scary. Teachers get more holidays, but I think I will stay with farming!

**D. Hilary's story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, feeling early. But I found out Rosemary had been awake for three hours! Her farm is big and has 100 cows, 15 young cows, and about 800 sheep! She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell. I spent the morning in the ice cream shop. I put milk into bottles, filled ice cream cartons from a machine, and put labels on them. It was hard not to taste the ice cream!

At lunchtime, I went to check the sheep. I drove to a field and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If a sheep is on its back for more than 12 hours, it can die, so they must be checked every day. It must be terrible in winter!

After I fed the young cows, I started the milking. It took two and a half hours and was very tiring. Rosemary does this two times every day, starting at 6 am, every single day of the year!

I felt a bit lonely. I was surprised how much I missed the children at school – animals don't talk to you! The worst part of the job is that you can never get away from work. The cows must be milked twice a day, so it's hard to have a day off. Rosemary will only have about three days of holiday this year.

Farming seems nice, but the real life is very different. The money is not always the same, and I would not like to depend so much on the weather.",,,
225,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?

We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said.

Publisher A

Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The Book Marketing Council found some years ago that when questioned on why they had bought a particular hook, more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence (advertisements, word of mouth, bookshop display, etc.).
Authors' responses to reviews are slightly different from publishers. Both are devastated by no reviews, but publishers are usually more equable about the had reviews, judging that column inches are what matter and that a combination of denunciation and ecstatic praise can actually create sales as readers decide to judge for themselves.
Publishers probably get the most pleasure from a review which precisely echoes their own response to a book - they are often the first 'reader'.

Publisher B

While publishers and the press fairly obviously have a common interest in the nature of book review pages, one also needs to remember that their requirements substantially differ: a newspaper or magazine needs to provide its readers with appropriately entertaining material; a publishing house wants to see books, preferably its own, reviewed, preferably favourably.
Without any question, book reviewing is 'better' -- more diverse, less elitist -- than 40 years ago, when I began reading review pages. That said, there is still a long-grumbled-about tendency to neglect the book medium read by a majority -- namely paperbacks. The weekly roundups aren't really adequate even if conscientiously done. And even original paperbacks only rarely receive serious coverage.
But publishers shouldn't complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews, which after all are an economical way of getting a book and an author known. There is no question that a lively account of a new book by a trusted name can generate sales even more if there are several of them. Fame is what puts a book into the hands of readers.

Publisher C

Reviews are the oxygen of literary publishing; without them, we would be cut off from an essential life-source. Because the books we publish are generally not by 'brand-name' authors, whose books sell with or without reviews, and because we seldom advertise, we depend on the space given to our books by literary editors.
When the reviews are favourable, of course, they are worth infinitely more than any advertisement. The reader knows that the good review is not influenced by the publisher's marketing budget: it is the voice of reason, and there is no doubt that it helps to sell books. Publishers themselves often claim that they look for size rather than content in reviews.
The actual effect of reviews on sales is the inscrutable heart of the whole business. Good reviews can launch a book and a career and occasionally lift sales into the stratosphere: but never entirely on their own. There has to be some fusion with other elements -- a word-of-mouth network of recommendation, a robust response from the book trade, clever marketing.

Publisher D

The relationship in Britain between publishing and reviewing? I wish I knew! In the United States it's simple: the New York Times can make or break a book with a single review. Here, though, the people in the bookshops often don't appear to take much notice of them.
It sometimes takes 20 years of consistently outstanding reviews for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet some of the most dismally received books, or books not yet reviewed, are the biggest sellers of all. So it's all very unpredictable, though non-action is less so.
Mind you, non-fiction does allow reviewers to indulge themselves by telling us what they know about the subject of the book under review rather than about the book itself.

Publisher E

Of course, all publishers and all writers dream of long, uniformly laudatory reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography. The reviews were everything I could have craved. The book was a flop -- because everyone thought that, by reading the lengthy reviews, they need not buy the book.
Does the name of the reviewer make a difference? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, the public seemed to take note and obey their recommendations. These days, it is as much the choice of an unexpected reviewer, or the sheer power or wit or originality of the review, which urges the prospective buyer into the bookshop.",C1,,"Do reviews sell books?

We asked five important British book publishers. We asked if reviews help to sell books. Here is what they said.

Publisher A

Reviews are very important for publishers. We look at them first in the newspaper. A study found that more people buy a book because of a review. This is more than because of ads or friends.
Authors and publishers feel differently about bad reviews. Both are sad if there are no reviews. But publishers are often okay with a bad review. They think any review is good. It makes people talk about the book. This can make readers want to see the book for themselves.
Publishers are happiest when a reviewer likes the book as much as they do.

Publisher B

Publishers and newspapers both want book reviews. But they want different things. A newspaper wants to give readers fun things to read. A publisher wants its books to get good reviews.
Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago. More kinds of books get reviews. But people still say that not enough paperbacks are reviewed.
Publishers should not complain. They need reviews. A good review from someone people trust can help sell a book. Being famous helps a book find readers.

Publisher C

Reviews are very important for book publishers. We need them. We usually publish books by new writers, not famous ones. We do not often use ads. So we need newspapers to write about our books.
A good review is much better than an ad. The reader knows the reviewer is telling the truth. This helps to sell books.
It is hard to know how much reviews change sales. Good reviews can make a book and writer successful. But other things must happen too, like people telling friends about the book.

Publisher D

What is the link between making books and reviewing them in Britain? I do not know. In the United States, one review in the New York Times can make a book a big success or a big failure. But in Britain, people in bookshops often do not seem to read reviews.
Sometimes, a very good writer gets great reviews for many years before people read their books. And some books with bad reviews, or no reviews, sell very well. So it is hard to know what will happen.
Also, when reviewers write about true story books, they sometimes write more about what they know than about the book.

Publisher E

All publishers and writers want long, very good reviews. But do these reviews sell books? I once published a book about a person's life. The reviews were perfect. But the book did not sell. People thought that after reading the long reviews, they did not need to buy the book.
Is the reviewer's name important? Thirty years ago, if important reviewers liked a book, people listened and bought it. Today, a review from a surprise person, or a very smart or funny review, can also make someone go to a bookshop to buy the book.","Do Reviews Help Sell Books?

Still, publishers should not complain too much. Reviews are a cheap way to make a book and its author famous. A good review from a writer people trust can really help sell a book. Fame is what makes people pick up a book to read.

Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain important reviewers liked a book, the public listened and bought it. Today, a review from a surprising person, or a review that is very powerful, funny, or original, can also make someone go to a bookshop to buy the book.","Do Book Reviews Help to Sell Books?

We asked five major British publishers whether reviews influence a book's commercial success. Here are their responses.

Publisher A

Reviews are extremely important for publishers – they are the first section of the newspaper we read. According to a past Book Marketing Council study, when people were asked why they bought a particular book, more mentioned reviews than any other influence, such as advertising or recommendations from friends.
Authors and publishers react differently to reviews. Both are disappointed if a book receives no reviews, but publishers are generally more accepting of negative ones. They believe that any publicity is valuable, and that a combination of very negative and very positive reviews can create interest, encouraging readers to form their own opinions.
Publishers are most satisfied when a reviewer's opinion of a book matches their own. They are often the first people to read it.

Publisher B

Publishers and the press clearly share an interest in book reviews, but their goals are different. A newspaper or magazine aims to provide its readers with engaging content, while a publisher wants its books to be reviewed, and ideally, praised.
Book reviewing has definitely improved over the last 40 years; it is now more diverse and less elitist. However, a common complaint remains that paperbacks, which are the most widely read format, are often ignored. Weekly review sections are not really sufficient, even when they are well done.
Still, publishers should not complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews. Reviews are a cost-effective method for making a book and its author known. There is no doubt that an enthusiastic review from a trusted source can increase sales, especially if there are several of them. A book's fame is what ultimately leads people to read it.

Publisher C

Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would lose a vital resource. Since we usually publish books by authors who are not famous, and because we rarely advertise, we rely on literary editors to feature our books.
When reviews are positive, they are far more valuable than any advertisement. Readers understand that a good review is an independent opinion, not influenced by the publisher's marketing. There is no question that this helps to sell books. Publishers themselves often admit they prefer a long review, regardless of its content.
The actual impact of reviews on sales is the great mystery of the business. Positive reviews can launch a book and an author's career, and sometimes they can cause sales to increase dramatically. However, this never happens in isolation. Other factors must also be present, such as word-of-mouth recommendations, strong support from bookshops, and effective marketing.

Publisher D

What is the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain? I wish I knew! In the United States, it is straightforward: a single review in the New York Times can determine a book's success or failure. Here, however, booksellers often do not seem to pay much attention to reviews.
Sometimes, a talented author receives excellent reviews for twenty years before the public begins to read their work. Yet, some books that get very negative reviews, or no reviews at all, become huge bestsellers. So it is all very unpredictable, although receiving no attention is almost always a bad sign.
It is also worth noting that with non-fiction, reviewers sometimes focus more on displaying their own knowledge of the subject than on evaluating the book itself.

Publisher E

Naturally, all publishers and authors dream of receiving long, entirely positive reviews. But do these reviews actually sell books? I once published a biography that received all the praise I could have wanted. Surprisingly, the book was a commercial failure. The reason was that people felt the detailed reviews meant they did not need to buy the book.
Does the reviewer's reputation make a difference? Thirty years ago, if certain respected reviewers recommended a book, the public would take notice and follow their advice. Nowadays, it can also be the choice of an unexpected reviewer, or the review's power, cleverness, or originality that persuades a potential buyer to visit a bookshop.",,
226,"Chewing gum culture

It's fashionable, classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today's gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners which help to hold the flavour and improve the texture.
This was not always the case, though. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree, a shrub found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Grecian women, especially, favoured mastic gum to clean their teeth and sweeten their breath.
American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees when the bark was cut. Lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States in the early 1800s making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree of the Central American rainforest.
Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew, and soon a whole industry was born based on this product.
Yet repeated attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed. As the chewing gum market has grown, synthetic alternatives have had to be developed.
Today the few remaining chicle gatherers, chicleros, eke out a meagre and dangerous living, trekking for miles to tap scattered sapodilla in near-100% humidity. Conditions are appalling: highly poisonous snakes lurk ready to pounce and insects abound.
Most alarming is the unpleasant little chicle fly that likes to lodge its eggs in the tappers ears and nose.
Braving these hazards, barefooted and with only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero will shin a mature tree in minutes to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow down to a bag below.
Each chiclero must carry the liquid on his back to a forest camp, where it is boiled until sticky and made into bricks. Life at the camp is no picnic either, with a monotonous and often deficient maize-based diet washed down by a local alcohol distilled from sugar cane.
Yet, punishing though this working environment is, the remaining chicleros fear for their livelihood.
Not so long ago, the United States alone imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America. Last year just 200 tonnes were tapped in the whole of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.
Meanwhile, the world's gum producers are finding ingenious ways of marketing their products. In addition to all the claims made for gum - it helps you relax, peps you up and eases tension (soldiers during both world wars were regularly supplied with gum) - gums greatest claim is that it reduces tooth decay.
Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes this. Our saliva, which neutralises the acid and supplies minerals such as calcium, phosphate and fluoride, is the body's natural defence. Gum manufacturers say 20 minutes of chewing can increase your salivary flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavours. Glycerine and other vegetable oil products are now used to blend the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial - but some flavours still need natural assistance.
In addition, one hundred and thirty-seven square kilometres of America is devoted entirely to producing the mint that is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world.",C1,,,"Chewing gum is popular with everyone, and Americans chew 12 million pieces every day. Let's see how an old habit became a big business.

Each piece of chewing gum has less than ten calories. It is considered a food, so it must follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration.

Most gum today is made from artificial materials. It has pine resins and softeners added to keep the taste and make it feel better to chew.

But this was not always true. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked it to clean their teeth and make their breath smell nice.

American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England. They chewed the resin from spruce trees when the bark was cut. In the early 1800s, this spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States. It was the first chewing gum sold in the country.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle. Chicle is a milky liquid that comes from the sapodilla tree in Central American rainforests.

Gum made from chicle was smoother and more pleasant to chew. Soon, a whole industry grew from this product.

However, people have tried and failed to grow sapodilla trees for business. As more and more gum was needed, artificial materials had to be created.

Today, the few people who still collect chicle, called chicleros, have a difficult and dangerous job. They walk for miles in very wet weather to find sapodilla trees. The conditions are terrible. There are many poisonous snakes and insects.

A very unpleasant small fly likes to lay its eggs in the chicleros' ears and noses.

Even with these dangers, an experienced chiclero climbs a tall tree in just a few minutes. Using only a rope and an axe, he cuts the bark so the white liquid flows into a bag below.

Each chiclero must carry the liquid on his back to a camp in the forest. There, it is boiled until it is sticky and made into bricks. Life at the camp is also hard. They eat a boring diet based on corn and drink a local alcohol made from sugar cane.

Even though the work is very hard, the remaining chicleros worry about their jobs.

Not long ago, the United States bought 7,000 tonnes of chicle every year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in all of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As more gum is sold, companies use artificial materials to lower costs and meet demand.

At the same time, gum companies are finding clever ways to sell their product. They say that chewing gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress. Soldiers in both world wars were often given gum. The biggest claim is that it helps prevent cavities.

Cavities are caused by an acid that forms when we eat. Our saliva fights this acid and gives us minerals like calcium and fluoride. Gum makers say that chewing for 20 minutes makes you produce more saliva.

Companies are still working on new textures and tastes for gum. Glycerine and vegetable oils are used to make the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients.

Also, a large area in America is used only to grow mint. This mint is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world.","Chewing gum is popular with everyone, and Americans chew millions of pieces every day. Let's look at how an old tradition became a huge industry.

Each piece of chewing gum has very few calories, but it is considered a food. This means it must follow rules set by the American Food and Drug Administration. Most gum today is made from artificial materials. Producers add pine resin and softeners to make the flavour last longer and improve how it feels when you chew it.

But this is a modern development. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked using this gum to clean their teeth and make their breath smell fresh.

Later, American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed the resin from spruce trees. By the early 1800s, this spruce gum was sold in the eastern United States, becoming the country's first commercial chewing gum.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle. This is a milky liquid that comes from the sapodilla tree in Central American rainforests. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more pleasant, and more stretchy to chew. This discovery soon led to a whole new industry.

However, people have never been able to grow sapodilla trees successfully on farms. As more and more gum was needed, companies had to create artificial alternatives.

Today, the few remaining chicle collectors, called chicleros, have a difficult and risky job. They walk for miles in very humid forests to find the trees. The conditions are terrible. There are many dangerous, poisonous snakes and lots of insects. A particularly worrying problem is a small fly that tries to lay its eggs in the collectors' ears and noses.

Facing these dangers, an experienced chiclero climbs a tall tree with just a rope and an axe. In minutes, he cuts a path in the tree's bark so the white liquid can flow down into a bag. Each chiclero must then carry this heavy liquid on his back to a camp in the forest. There, it is boiled until it becomes thick and is then shaped into bricks. Life at the camp is also hard. The workers eat a boring diet based on corn and drink a strong local alcohol made from sugar cane.

Even though the work is very tough, the remaining chicleros are worried about their jobs. A while ago, the United States imported thousands of tonnes of chicle every year from Central America. Last year, only a small amount was collected in Mexico's Yucatan area. Because the demand for chewing gum is so high, companies now mostly use artificial materials to make it cheaper and to produce enough.

At the same time, gum companies are clever at marketing their products. They make many claims, such as saying that gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress. For example, soldiers in both world wars were often given gum. The biggest claim is that chewing gum helps prevent cavities.

Companies are always researching new textures and flavours for gum. They use products like glycerine and vegetable oils to create the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial, but some still need natural ingredients.

Furthermore, a large area of land in America is used just to grow the mint that goes into the world's two most popular chewing gums.",,
227,"An awfully big adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it, and lived to tell the tale.

There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialise in them -- courageous explorers with sunburnt, leathery skin and eyes narrowed by straining to see into far horizons on their journeys into the unknown. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across one of the last unexplored places on earth, the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He recalled the dangers and exhilaration of that amazing trek, in the calm atmosphere of his family home.
The team he led was composed of four Britons (one of them the party's medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese (all experts on the area), 30 camels and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before, but were long-distance lorry drivers: a misunderstanding that could have cost everyone their lives and certainly jeopardised the expedition's success. This mixed bunch set out to cross 1,200 kilometres of the world's least hospitable desert and Charles Blackmore has written a mesmerising account of their journey. 
At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He launched the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I had always assumed I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered promotion but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a tremendous gamble. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the event, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'
Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word 'kind'. The team suffered unspeakable hardships: dysentery; extremes of temperature; severe thirst and dehydration; the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our own endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never hit the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally immobilised us. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against hurdles the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily laden camels, which often rolled over onto us.
'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no contingency plan. Neither our budget no time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills we were completely on our own.
'I knew I had the mental stamina for the trip but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert and it was such an inferno that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment I was a very scared man.'
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometres you're not going to duck out. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and sinewy despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'
Midway through the book, Blackmore went on to describe lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How conscious was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievements, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've dine. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that yardstick, the desert does not measure up, does not compare.'
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were buoyed up by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.'",C1,,"A very big adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in China is one of the last places on Earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore walked across it and lived to tell his story.

There are not many big adventures left. In old children's stories, you could read about brave explorers. They had brown skin from the sun and looked far into the distance. You do not find people like that in books or in real life now. Or that is what I thought before I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's big adventure was to lead a group across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means 'you go in but you never come out'. Local people call it the Desert of Death. He told me about the dangers and the excitement of his trip. We talked in his quiet family home.

His team had four British people, one American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six men to look after the camels. Later, they learned that the camel men were not experts. They were truck drivers. This mistake could have hurt everyone and could have stopped the trip. This group of people wanted to walk 1,200 kilometres across the world's most unfriendly desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a very interesting book about their journey.

At that time, he was going to leave the army after 14 good years. He started this trip for fun, to do something new, and to learn about himself. He said, ""I thought I would be in the army all my life. I got a better job in the army, but I wanted to know who I really was. It was a big risk. My wife Tina was very scared I would not come back because no one had done this walk before. We did not know what would happen. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east. The desert was good to us.""

If you read his book about the trip, you will be surprised that he said the desert was ""good"". The team had a very hard time. They got sick. It was very hot and very cold. They were very thirsty. They lost some of their water. But Blackmore says, ""When we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found water. We did not have the very bad sandstorms the desert is famous for. We did not have the very strong cold that would have stopped us. But we had problems all the time. Sand got into everything, especially into cuts and blisters. The big sand hills were very hard to climb, for us and for the camels with heavy bags. The camels often fell on us.

""What made me continue was the need to live. We had no other plan. We did not have enough money or time for another plan. No planes flew over us. When we were in the sand hills, we were alone.

""I knew I was strong in my mind for the trip, but I was scared my body was not strong enough. I remember the first day. We sat at the start of the desert. It was so hot you could not breathe. I thought, 'We must start now!' At that time, I was a very scared man.""

If the start was so bad, how did they feel near the end? ""When you have walked 1,000 kilometres, you will not stop. You have lived through so much. We were very thin, but our bodies were strong, even though we were very tired. My body was in good shape and my legs were very strong. I could walk over anything.""

In the middle of his book, Blackmore writes about lying in the desert and looking at the moon. He was thinking about his family. Did he know how hard it was for them? ""Inside me, I am a person who wants to feel calm. When I am not sure of myself now, I think about the desert. I think, we did that. Of all the things I have done, I am most proud of that trip. But when I think about my whole life, I think about my family and our happiness. Next to that, the desert trip is not as important.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I want another big challenge. I want the big, open spaces. I liked having a clear goal. Now, I find it hard to live a normal, modern life.""","A Very Big Adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on Earth that people have not explored. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore walked across it and lived to tell his story.

There are not many big adventures left today, and not many heroes. Children's books used to be full of them – brave explorers with tanned skin who travelled to unknown places. You don't find people like that in stories or in real life anymore. At least, that's what I thought before I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was to lead a group across one of the last unexplored places on Earth: the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""go in and you never come out."" Local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing trip while sitting calmly in his family home.

His team had four British people (one was the doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six men to handle the camels. Later, they found out the camel handlers had never worked with camels before. They were actually truck drivers! This mistake could have cost everyone their lives and almost ruined the trip. This group of people tried to cross 1,200 km of the world's most unfriendly desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating book about their journey.

At that time, he was going to leave the army after 14 good years. He started the trip for fun, to do something new, and to prove something to himself. He said, ""I always thought I would stay in the army my whole life. I was offered a better job, but I suddenly wanted to know who I really was outside the army. It was a big risk. My wife Tina was very worried I wouldn't come back because no one had ever done that trip before. We didn't know what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was actually quite kind to us.""

If you read his book about the trip, you might be surprised he used the word ""kind."" The team went through terrible difficulties: sickness, very hot and very cold weather, and not enough water. They even lost some of their water supply. But Blackmore explains, ""When we were very tired and the camels had no water for seven days, we found some. We didn't have the famous sandstorms. We also didn't have the extreme cold that would have stopped us completely. That doesn't mean it was easy. Sand got into everything, especially our cuts and blisters. The tall sand dunes were very hard to climb, for us and for the camels carrying heavy loads. Sometimes the camels fell on us.""

""What kept me going more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. We didn't have enough money or time for one. No planes ever flew over us. Once we were in the sand hills, we were completely alone.""

""I knew I was strong in my mind for the trip, but I was afraid my body wasn't strong enough. I remember the first day – we sat at the edge of the desert and it was so hot you couldn't breathe. I thought, 'We have to do this now!' At that moment, I was a very frightened man.""

If it was so hard at the start, how did they feel near the end? ""When you have walked 1,000 km, you are not going to give up. You have been through so much. We were very thin, but our bodies were strong, even though we were tired. My legs felt like powerful machines. I felt I could walk over anything.""

In the middle of his book, Blackmore writes about lying in the desert, looking at the full moon and thinking of his family. Did he understand how hard it was for them? ""Inside me, there is a person who is trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think of the desert and remember that we succeeded. As a personal success, I am more proud of that trip than anything else I have done. But when I think about a whole life's achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we have. Compared to that, the desert trip is not as important.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I miss the challenge – the open space – the strong feeling of having a goal. We were lifted up by our purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of normal, modern life where everything is the same.""",,,
228,"Explore Worldwide - small groups leave few footprints

Explore Worldwide is right in the forefront of adventure travel with trips designed for people who want to get more out of their holiday than just a beach. Our emphasis is on travel to new and unusual destinations, coupled with interesting and original itineraries. Our brochure contains over 100 original adventures - tours, treks, safaris and expeditions - in more than 60 countries around the world. Most trips last from 1-4 weeks.

Small Groups

Averaging 16 people. Small informal groups, expertly led. Giving you a real opportunity to discover more about the places we visit for yourself. More personal involvement brings you closer to the local scene and the local peoples. A stimulating experience for all travellers.

Different Modes of Travel

Many different kinds of transport are used. Often on the same trip. We travel by chartered coach or local bus, by train, expedition vehicle, minibus, boat, canoe, raft, camel, light plane etc. And often on foot. Each trip takes on the character of the local terrain.

Who Travels with Explore?

Interesting people with the resilience to tackle new situations and get the most out of an original adventure. Mainly from the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the States. All our trips are designed to be within the capabilities of almost anyone who enjoys good health, is reasonably fit, and above all adaptable. The majority are aged between 25 and 55. About half are couples. The rest are enterprising individuals travelling alone.

Activities and Interests

It's not easy to describe Explore Worldwide. Each trip is completely unique. So we have divided our worldwide adventures into 8 different categories, describing some of the main activities and interests. Each category represents a special highlight that is an integral part of a particular tour, and of course trips have several different highlights. However, please bear in mind that many other factors contribute to the success of all our trips as a whole. Unique places, unusual encounters, strange customs, unpredictable events, personal involvement - all play their part in the full enjoyment of your holiday.

Cultural/Adventure

Almost all the trips in our brochure have a strong cultural feeling. But a certain number of tours have this as their primary emphasis, focusing closely on local cultures, ethnic peoples and classic sites. For example, anyone looking for destinations of outstanding cultural and historical interest should consider our trips in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala and Belize - to mention a few of the places featured in our programme! Short day walks of 2-4 hours to visit unusual or off-the-tourist-track sites are often an integral part of our trips.

Wildlife and Natural History

Our wildlife safaris visit many of the world's greatest game parks and offer a thrilling encounter with animals in their natural state. Choose from dozens of remarkable destinations. In Africa, for example, you often have the freedom to step outside your safari vehicle and tackle the wild terrain for yourself. You could track the rare silver-back mountain gorilla in Zaire, go bush walking with tribal guides in Uganda, climb Mount Kenya, ride a canoe on the Zambezi River or a traditional mokoro in the Okavango Delta. Most African safaris camp, and full camping equipment is provided. A few offer hotel and lodge accommodation throughout. Elsewhere, in Asia and South America, on trips which include game viewing - say, our tiger safari in India - we usually stay in hotels, resthouses and jungle lodges. In Darwin's famous Galapagos Islands we live aboard a small motor yacht.

Ethnic Encounters

A special highlight of an Explore Worldwide adventure is the opportunity it offers to meet ethnic or tribal peoples. These could be the 'Blue Men' or Tuareg of the Central Sahara, the Maya of Mexico, or the colourful Huli of Papua New Guinea. Some, like the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, are nomadic wanderers. Others, like the pygmies of the Ituri Forest, are hunter-gatherers; or dry rice farmers like the friendly hilltribe peoples of Northern Thailand. Many are often part of an 'Old World' culture. Their societies are often under serious threat from unscrupulous exploiters. We travel in small groups only. Our aim is to help spread tolerance and understanding between different races and peoples, with the minimum of culture and environmental disturbance.

Easy/Moderate Hiking

Many trips include a few days' easy walking through open countryside, based on rented or hotel accommodation; also village-to-village hiking which involves some trail walking with the prospect of overnighting along the way in private houses or basic village huts. You'll find such trips in Spain's Sierra Nevada, in Provence, Tuscany, Crete, Corsica, Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, Venezuela, and many other Explore Worldwide destinations. On long distance walks involving more than one day, all your main luggage is transported by a separate vehicle, or carried by porters or pack animals. You simply bring a daypack for your personal gear.

Major Treks

A limited number of major treks are offered for strong mountain walkers. These sometimes involve walking at elevations over 10,000 feet, with substantial altitude gains and losses during a single day. We may lodge with the local people or rough-camp in the world's great mountain ranges like the Atlas, Kackar, Himalayas and Andes. Or we use a mixture of well-appointed camp-sites and alpine chalets in more sophisticated mountain areas such as the Alps. Such trips usually involve support vehicles, porterage or pack animals. We rarely backpack or carry heavy gear.

Wilderness Experience

Discovering one of the world's remote wilderness areas is a thrilling and memorable experience - perhaps the ultimate travel adventure. Such places have a strong fascination for the intrepid traveller, holding out the prospect of exotic new horizons. We explore the haunting beauty of the Amazon Rainforest and experience the powerful mystique of the Sahara, Great Thor, Namib and Gobi Deserts. They offer a chance to participate in an adventure few people could ever dream of.

Sailtreks/Seatreks

These are among the most original and relaxing holidays in our brochure. We charter local boats and journey by traditional felucca sailboat through Upper Egypt; we utilise gulets (wooden motor yachts) in Turkey and island-to-island ferries in countries like Greece and Thailand. Our 2-masted schooner explores the islands of the Indonesian Archipelago, while a small motor yacht is chartered to cruise among the unique wildlife habitats of the Galapagos.

Raft and River Journeys

River journeys can last from a few hours to several days, and range from 2-person inflatables which participants paddle themselves (on the Dordogne River, for example) to all the fun, thrills and excitement of whitewater railing navigated by skilled oarsmen (such as on Peru's beautiful Urubamba River or the wild Trisuli River in Nepal). No previous experience is necessary and the appropriate safety skills are quickly learned. Our river trips in India, Africa and the Amazon offer us a unique insight into the fertile margins and exotic jungles.",C1,"Travel with Explore Worldwide. We have small groups.

229,"Careers

Six people talk about their typical working day

A. Credit Card Executive

I get up at 6 am to arrive at the office around 7.30 am. I manage all the customer development programmes for our regular credit card users. My responsibilities include the launch and management of the Membership Rewards scheme in the major European markets. I have to keep in touch with existing card users, acquire new ones and build relationships with partner companies.
I use the first 45 minutes to organise my day and then I respond to any e-mail messages. I manage all the advertising for the membership programme across Europe, so I meet with our marketing staff and the advertising agencies to establish a strategy and work on future developments. I have meetings scheduled for most of the day, but at all other times I make sure I keep my door open for anyone to come and ask me questions.
There are nine customer service units around Europe and I have to travel to the different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues that come up. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

B. Record Company Executive

I get to work for 10.00 am and go through the post - between ten and twenty demonstration tapes a day, letters from producers and information about concerts, as well as invoices from session musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing at about 10.30 am - producers, publishers and so on, and there are meetings arranged throughout the day to talk about campaigns or projects for a particular artist. This might involve the press, marketing and the managing director.
When I listen to demo tapes I am very aware that people are bringing in their life's work, so I try to be constructive. I instinctively know if the sound is appropriate for our record label. Once I've signed a band, we start on the first album - choosing the songs, producer, and additional musicians. Then I have to communicate my vision of the album to the rest of the company for marketing and selling. I also oversee budgets and spending.
I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and most evenings I go to gigs - sometimes I see as many as five new groups a night. Sometimes after a gig I'll visit an artist in the studio. Most of my socialising evolves around my work. I often don't get home until 1.00 am - when I put on a record to help me wind down.

C. Sales Director

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work to arrive at 9.30 am. I open the post, look through the diary to check if we're going to see any clients that day, then wait and see who turns up.
I love taking people round the showrooms - there's nothing better than reaching an agreement with someone, selling them a piece of furniture and knowing it's going to a good home. We sell antiques from PS1,000 to PS6,000 and buy from the London salerooms, country house sales, our private clients and overseas.
A lot of what we buy needs restoration. We have a full-time restorer in the shop, and I spend a lot of time liaising with gilders, picture framers and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while I drink coffee at odd moments, to keep in touch with what's going on in the business, and I often pop into the Victoria and Albert museum to compare furniture.
I do the accounts one day every month and every three months I do the tax returns. At 5.30 pm I go home. It usually takes me about an hour to switch off.

D. Air Traffic Controller

I work a set shift pattern, and when I'm on an early shift I leave the house at 6.00 am. At 7.00 am I relieve the night shift and take over one of the four control positions in the tower.
We have a rotating timetable, which means that I work for about an hour and a half at one of the stations, go off for half an hour and then come back to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor and the watch manager all sit near to each other and work as a team, controlling the aircraft movements.
In winter we deal with about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are much quieter, and I usually get a chance to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am.
It's important to be really switched on in this job, so even if I'm only a bit under the weather I have no qualms about being off sick. I find the work quite stressful and it can take a while to wind down at the end of a shift. Eventually I'd like to be watch manager, and then maybe even general manager of the airport.

E. Shop Manager

If I'm on an early shift, I leave the house by 8.00 am. The first thing I do is get the electronic point-of-sale system up and running.
I always make sure there's someone to watch the till and I co-ordinate people's lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers, finding and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, although it can be a bit annoying if they come in waving reviews and expect you to run around gathering a pile of books for them.
Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm most weekdays, publishers' reps come into the shop and I spend some time discussing new titles for the months ahead. I have to consider how many, if any, of a particular title the shop is likely to sell. When we want to feature a new title, it's essential that I make sure it's delivered in time.
The early shift finishes at 5.45 pm. Two days a week I do a late shift, and then I close down the computer system, lock up and go home.

F. Financial Analyst

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to arrive at work at 8.45 am. First I get in touch with our freelance reporters to find out what is happening in the region I'm responsible for.
I assess financial risk for multi-national companies operating abroad, so it is my job to try to warn clients well in advance of anything that could go wrong in that country. I provide three services: an on-line executive preview, or newsflash; a security forecast, which is an extended preview plus a forecast for the next six months; and a travel information security guide.
From 9.15 am to 9.30 am I meet with our editors to discuss the stories I'm going to follow. My first executive preview has to be on-line by 10.00 am and my second deadline is 11.00 am, so I have to be quick chasing up stories. I type them, send them through to my editor, who edits and approves them, then I re-check and make any necessary alterations before they go through the system. 
I travel to Africa about three times a year, to report on specific events or just to keep up with what is happening. I leave work at around 6.00 pm. It's quite difficult to switch off and most evenings I'm still awake at 1.00 am.",C1,,"**A. Credit Card Manager**

I get up at 6 am. I arrive at the office at 7:30 am. My job is to look after our credit card customers. I start new programmes for them. I also talk to other companies we work with. I need to find new customers and make our current customers happy.

First, I plan my day for 45 minutes. Then I answer my emails. I also plan the advertisements for our programmes in Europe. I meet with the marketing team and advertising people. We talk about our plans. I have meetings most of the day. But my door is always open for questions.

We have customer service teams in nine countries in Europe. I travel to see them once or twice a week. When I am in London, I finish work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Music Company Manager**

I start work at 10:00 am. I open the mail. I get ten to twenty music tapes every day. I also get letters from music makers and information about concerts.

The phone starts ringing at 10:30 am. I talk to music makers and other people. I have meetings all day. We talk about our music artists.

When I listen to the music tapes, I try to be nice. The music is very important to the people who make it. I know if the music is good for our company. When I choose a band, we make their first album. I tell the company my ideas for the album. I also check how much money we spend.

I leave work at 7:00 pm at the earliest. Most evenings I go to see new bands play. Sometimes I visit a singer in the music studio after the show. I often get home at 1:00 am. Then I listen to music to feel calm.

**C. Sales Manager**

I get up at 8:00 am. I drive to work. I arrive at 9:30 am. I open the mail. I check my diary to see if I am meeting any customers.

I love showing people our showrooms. The best part of my job is selling a piece of furniture. I like knowing the customer will be happy. We sell old furniture. It costs from £1,000 to £6,000. We buy from sales in London, from big houses, from people, and from other countries.

A lot of the furniture we buy needs to be fixed. We have a person in the shop who fixes things. I also talk to other people who help us repair the furniture. I read a special newspaper about old furniture when I drink coffee. I also often go to a museum to look at the furniture there.

One day every month I do the money papers. Every three months I do the tax papers. I go home at 5:30 pm. It usually takes me about an hour to feel calm.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work at different times. On an early day, I leave home at 6:00 am. At 7:00 am, I start my work. I take over from the night team. I sit in the control tower.

We change where we sit often. I work at one place for about an hour and a half. Then I have a break for half an hour. Then I go to a different place. We work as a team to tell the planes what to do.

In winter, we have about 1,000 planes a day. In summer, we have more. Night work is quieter. Between 12 am and 4 am, I usually have time to read about new rules for planes.

You must look carefully in this job. If I feel a little sick, I do not go to work. I find the work hard and it takes time to feel calm after my day. Later, I would like to be a manager in the tower. Maybe one day I will be the airport manager.

**E. Shop Manager**

On an early day, I leave home before 8:00 am. The first thing I do is turn on the computer for the cash machine.

I make sure someone is always at the cash machine. I also plan the lunch times for the workers. In the morning, I help customers find and order books. I like helping customers. But sometimes it is not nice when they want me to find many books for them very fast.

On most weekdays, between 2:00 pm and 4:00 pm, people from book companies visit the shop. We talk about new books for the next few months. I decide how many copies of a new book we should buy. When we want to show a new book in the shop, I must make sure it comes on time.

The early day finishes at 5:45 pm. Two days a week I work a late day. Then I turn off the computer, lock the shop, and go home.

**F. Money Adviser**

I listen to the news at 7:00 am. Then I get up and take a taxi to work. I arrive at 8:45 am. First, I talk to our news people. I learn about the news in the countries I look after.

I help big companies. I tell them about money problems in other countries. I tell my customers if something bad might happen in a country. I do three things: I write a short news story, a six-month safety plan, and a travel safety guide.

From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with the editors. We talk about the stories I will write. My first news story must be online by 10:00 am. My second story must be ready by 11:00 am, so I have to work fast. I type the stories and send them to my editor. He checks them and I make changes before they go online.

I travel to Africa about three times a year. I write about things that happen there. I leave work at about 6:00 pm. It is difficult to stop thinking about work. Most evenings I am still awake at 1:00 am.","**Careers**

Six people talk about their normal working day

**A. Credit Card Manager**

I wake up at 6 am and get to the office at about 7.30 am. I am in charge of programmes for our regular credit card users. My job is to start and manage the Membership Rewards programme in big European countries. I need to talk to current card users, find new ones, and work with other companies.
I use the first 45 minutes to plan my day and then I answer emails. I manage all the advertising for the membership programme in Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising companies to make plans. I have meetings for most of the day, but when I am free, I keep my door open so people can come and ask me questions.
There are nine customer service offices around Europe and I travel to them once or twice a week to talk about problems. When I am in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Manager**

I start work at 10.00 am and look at the post. I get between ten and twenty demo tapes a day, letters from producers, information about concerts, and bills from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing at about 10.30 am. I get calls from producers, publishers, and others. I have meetings during the day to talk about plans for an artist. People from the press, marketing, and the boss are often in these meetings.
When I listen to demo tapes, I know that people are sharing their important work, so I try to be helpful. I know quickly if the music is right for our company. After I choose a band, we start work on their first album. We choose the songs, the producer, and other musicians. Then I tell the rest of the company about my ideas for the album so they can sell it. I also check the money we spend.
I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest. Most evenings I go to concerts. Sometimes I see five new groups in one night. Sometimes after a concert I visit an artist in the studio. Most of my friends are from my work. I often get home at 1.00 am. Then I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Manager**

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work. I arrive at 9.30 am. I open the post, check the diary to see if we are meeting clients, and then wait to see who comes to the shop.
I love showing people around the showrooms. The best thing is agreeing with a customer, selling them furniture, and knowing it will go to a good home. We sell old furniture from £1,000 to £6,000. We buy from London sales, big house sales, private people, and from other countries.
A lot of the furniture we buy needs to be fixed. We have a person who fixes things in the shop. I also spend time talking to people who work with gold, picture frames, and paper. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette when I drink coffee to know what is happening in the business. I often go to the Victoria and Albert museum to look at furniture.
I do the accounts for one day every month and the tax returns every three months. I go home at 5.30 pm. It usually takes me about an hour to relax.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work different shifts. When I have an early shift, I leave home at 6.00 am. At 7.00 am, I start work and take over from the night team. I sit at one of the four control positions in the tower.
We have a timetable that changes. I work for about an hour and a half at one station, then I have a break for half an hour, and then I go to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a boss, and the manager all sit near each other and work as a team to control the planes.
In winter, we have about 1,000 planes a day, and more in summer. Night shifts are much quieter. I usually have time to read about new rules for air traffic between 12 and 4.00 am.
It is very important to pay attention in this job. So, if I feel even a little ill, I stay at home. I find the work quite stressful and it can take time to relax after a shift. In the future, I would like to be a manager, and then maybe the boss of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**

If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. The first thing I do is turn on the computer system for the tills.
I always make sure someone is at the till. I also organise people's lunch breaks. In the morning, I help customers and find and order books for them. I like helping customers, but it can be annoying if they come in with a newspaper review and want me to find many books for them.
Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm on most weekdays, people from book publishers come to the shop. I talk to them about new books for the next few months. I have to think about how many copies of a book we can sell. When we want to show a new book, I need to make sure it arrives on time.
The early shift finishes at 5.45 pm. Two days a week I have a late shift. Then I turn off the computer, lock the shop, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work. I arrive at 8.45 am. First, I contact our reporters to find out what is happening in the countries I am responsible for.
I check the financial risks for big companies that work in other countries. My job is to tell clients about problems that could happen in those countries. I offer three services: a fast online news report; a security report for the next six months; and a travel security guide.
From 9.15 am to 9.30 am I meet with our editors to talk about the stories I will write. My first news report must be online by 10.00 am and my second one by 11.00 am, so I have to work quickly. I type the stories and send them to my editor. He checks and approves them. Then I check them again and make changes before they go online.

Six people describe their typical working day

**A. Credit Card Executive**

I wake up at 6 am to get to the office by 7.30 am. I am in charge of all the customer development programmes for our regular credit card users. My job involves launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in the main European markets. I need to stay in contact with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies.
I use the first 45 minutes to plan my day and then I answer emails. I manage all the advertising for the membership programme across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to create a strategy and plan future projects. I have meetings for most of the day, but when I'm free, I always keep my door open so people can come and ask me questions.
There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different countries once or twice a week to discuss any problems. When I'm in London, I finish work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**

I start work at 10.00 am and look through the post – I receive between ten and twenty demo tapes a day, letters from producers, information about concerts, and bills from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing at about 10.30 am – calls from producers, publishers, and others. I have meetings during the day to talk about campaigns or projects for specific artists. These meetings can include people from the press, marketing, and the managing director.
When I listen to demo tapes, I remember that people are sharing their life's work, so I try to be helpful. I can usually tell if the music is right for our record label. After I sign a band, we start working on their first album – choosing songs, a producer, and other musicians. Then I have to explain my ideas for the album to the rest of the company for marketing and sales. I also manage budgets and spending.
I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest, and most evenings I go to concerts – sometimes I see up to five new groups in one night. Sometimes after a concert I visit an artist in the studio. Most of my social life is connected to my work. I often don't get home until 1.00 am – then I listen to music to help me relax.

**C. Sales Director**

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work to arrive at 9.30 am. I open the post, check the diary to see if we are meeting any clients that day, and then wait to see who comes in.
I really enjoy showing people around the showrooms – there's nothing better than making a deal, selling someone a piece of furniture, and knowing it's going to a good home. We sell antiques from £1,000 to £6,000 and we buy from London sales, country house sales, private clients, and from overseas.
A lot of the furniture we buy needs to be repaired. We have a full-time restorer in the shop, and I spend a lot of time working with gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while I drink coffee when I have a free moment, to stay informed about the business. I also often visit the Victoria and Albert museum to compare furniture.
I do the accounts one day every month and the tax returns every three months. At 5.30 pm I go home. It usually takes me about an hour to relax.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**

I work a fixed shift pattern. When I'm on an early shift, I leave home at 6.00 am. At 7.00 am, I take over from the night shift at one of the four control positions in the tower.
We have a rotating schedule, which means I work for about an hour and a half at one station, have a half-hour break, and then return to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager all sit close together and work as a team to control the aircraft.
In winter, we handle about 1,000 aircraft movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are much quieter, and I usually have a chance to read about new air traffic rules between 12 am and 4.00 am.
It's very important to be fully focused in this job, so if I feel even a little unwell, I don't hesitate to take a sick day. I find the work quite stressful and it can take some time to relax after a shift. In the future, I would like to become a watch manager, and maybe even the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**

If I'm on an early shift, I leave home by 8.00 am. The first thing I do is start the electronic point-of-sale system.
I always make sure someone is at the till, and I organise people's lunch breaks. I spend the morning helping customers, finding and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, although it can be a bit annoying when they come in with reviews and expect you to quickly find a lot of books for them.
Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm on most weekdays, publishers' representatives visit the shop, and I spend some time discussing new books for the coming months. I have to decide how many copies of a particular book the shop is likely to sell. When we want to promote a new book, it's very important that I make sure it arrives on time.
The early shift finishes at 5.45 pm. Two days a week I work a late shift, and then I shut down the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to arrive at work by 8.45 am. First, I contact our freelance reporters to find out what is happening in the region I'm responsible for.
I assess financial risk for multi-national companies that work abroad, so my job is to warn clients in advance about anything that could go wrong in a country. I provide three services: an online executive preview, or newsflash; a security forecast, which is a longer preview plus a forecast for the next six months; and a travel information security guide.
From 9.15 am to 9.30 am I meet with our editors to discuss the stories I'm going to research. My first executive preview must be online by 10.00 am and my second deadline is 11.00 am, so I have to work quickly to get the stories. I type them, send them to my editor, who edits and approves them, then I check them again and make any necessary changes before they are published.

230,"Is your office working ok?

Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices, to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist, who studies people's working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. Here are their verdicts.

Office A. Advertising Agency

Building Health Consultant: This office is about as simple as it could possibly be; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows opening straight onto the street. It is difficult to see why this space works but the occupants who are part of a small, dynamic team, appear to have few complaints. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators -- pretty much, perhaps, as they do in their own homes. This may be the key: a team of seven people have crated a happy, homely working environment and do not have to put up with any externally imposed bureaucracy.
Ergonomist: The furniture here has evolved; no two pieces match. Much of it actually creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable and many are broken. Although in that way this environment is poor, the personnel have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, out meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom and muscular problems.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are delighted with the variety of work and the versatility of the office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to be able to be on your own and focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, simultaneously conveying images of efficiency and creativity.

Office B. News Service

Building Health Consultant: While the office may not be very exciting, it appears comfortable and is not disliked by the staff. The air quality and general maintenance standards appear to be good. This is helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: I was not surprised to learn that the company had already employed the services of an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space provision is good, although the layout could be improved. But the environments is impersonal and unstimulating, with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare apart from year planners and a poster describing maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years and relationships are satisfactory. The office could be improved if the desks were positioned to make the sharing of information easier. Proof of success or information on forthcoming projects could be displayed on the walls.

Office C. Bank

Building Health Consultant: An office that produces mixed reactions from those working in it. The feeling inside is akin to being in a glass case, viewed by, and viewing, countless similar exhibits. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a relatively small space, the air did not appear to be stale. Even standing only 1.5 metres away from a smoker, it was not possible to smell his cigarette. 
Ergonomist: The office area is, sadly, very standard and totally uninspiring. The desks are adequate, but only just. Not all the chairs being used for computer operation conform to requirements but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desk units with lowered keyboard shelves; this is no longer considered appropriate for modern equipment.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are mutually supportive and well served by technology. Numerous communications awards are on display. The wood coloured panelling and brown carpet give a slightly sombre effect. The office is a buzz of activity.

Office D. Newspaper

Building Health Consultant: It is difficult to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning control is very crude, resulting in large variations in temperature. The space is cluttered and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is very dusty -- there are plenty of places for dust to lodge. The shed-type roof also collects dust, which, if disturbed, showers those sitting below.
Ergonomist: The furniture would be more at home in a carpentry workshop than in a high-tech industry. Most of the chairs are of little value to keyboard users, particularly those who are shorter than about 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack suitable adjustment and have armrests that prevent the user from getting sufficiently close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, soiled carpets, dust and dirt everywhere. A lot of scope for improvement -- the place needs a good tidy-up, individual success could be more recognised, air conditioning needs to be improved immediately -- there are so many smokers. Few conversations were going on when we visited; everybody seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt a policy of team-working.",C1,"Is your office good?

A new study says fresh air and good chairs make workers happy and healthy. We visited four different offices to see if they are good places to work. We asked three experts for their opinions: a building health expert, a person who studies how people work, and a work psychologist. Here is what they said.

**Office A: Advertising Company**

Building Health Expert: This office is very simple. There is no central heating. The windows open to the street. It is a small, busy team. The workers are happy. They open doors and windows when it is hot. They turn on heaters when it is cold. They work like they are at home. This is a happy office.

Work Expert: The furniture is old. The chairs are old and broken. They are not good for sitting. But the workers do different things. They work in the office, meet clients, and give talks. This is good. They do not get bored or tired.

Work Psychologist: The workers like their jobs and their office. The office is not too big and not too small. They can work alone or with others. The office looks fun and creative.

**Office B: News Company**

Building Health Expert: The office is comfortable. The workers like it. The air is clean. No one smokes inside.

Work Expert: The chairs are very good. The lights and computers are good. There is a lot of space. But the walls are grey and empty. It is not a fun place.

Work Psychologist: The walls are empty. The workers have worked here for a long time. They get along well. The office could be better. They could put desks together to talk more. They could put pictures on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**

Building Health Expert: People have different feelings about this office. It has a lot of glass. You can see other people. Smokers and non-smokers work together, but the air is okay. You cannot smell the smoke.

Work Expert: The office is normal and not exciting. The desks are okay. The chairs for the computers are not all good. The computer tables are too small.

Work Psychologist: The workers help each other. They have good technology. They have won awards. The office has brown walls and carpet. It looks a little dark. The office is very busy.

**Office D: Newspaper Company**

Building Health Expert: This building is not good. The air conditioning is bad. It is too hot or too cold. The office is messy. People do not have enough desk space. It is very dusty.

Work Expert: The furniture is old, like in a workshop. The chairs are not good for people who use computers. Many chairs are old and broken. The armrests are a problem.

Work Psychologist: The office has old brown chairs and dirty carpets. It is dusty. They need to clean it. They need to say ""good job"" to workers more. The air conditioning must get better because many people smoke. When we visited, people were quiet and busy. They need to work more as a team.","Is your office a good place to work?

A new study says fresh air and good chairs help workers be happy and healthy. We went to four different offices to see how good they are for people. We asked three experts: a building expert, a work expert, and a people expert. Here is what they said.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

Building Expert: This office is very simple. It has no central heating. The windows open to the street. It is hard to understand why it is good, but the small team is happy. They change things with the seasons, like opening doors or using heaters, like at home. This might be why it works: the seven people made a nice, home-like office.
Work Expert: The furniture is all different. Most of it is not good for sitting well. The chairs are old, many are broken, and you cannot change them. But the people do different kinds of work — in the office, with clients, giving talks. This change helps them not get tired.
People Expert: The workers like the different jobs and the office space. They said the office is a good size — small enough to know your coworkers, but big enough to work alone. I thought the office was nice and fun. It looked good for work and new ideas.

**Office B: News Service**

Building Expert: This office is not exciting, but it is comfortable and the workers like it. The air is good and the office is clean. This is because no one can smoke inside.
Work Expert: The company asked a work expert before. The chairs are very good. The lights and computers are good too. There is enough space, but the way it is set up could be better. The office feels a bit boring, with grey walls.
People Expert: The walls have almost nothing on them. Most workers have been there for over five years and are friends. The office could be better if the desks were closer so people can talk more. They could put news about their work on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**

Building Expert: People in this office have different feelings about it. Inside, it feels like you are in a glass box, and you see other people in boxes too. Some people smoke and some do not, but the air felt okay. Even standing near a smoker, you could not smell the smoke.
Work Expert: This office is very normal and not interesting. The desks are okay, but only just. Not all the chairs for computer work are the right kind, but the workers chose them. The computer screens are on small desks, which is not good.
People Expert: The workers help each other and have good computers. You can see many awards on the walls. The brown wood and carpet make the office feel a little dark. The office is very busy.

**Office D: Newspaper**

Building Expert: It is hard to say good things about this building. The air conditioning is very simple, so the temperature changes a lot. The space is messy and most people do not have enough desk space. The office is very dusty — dust can go in many places. The roof also has dust, and if it moves, it falls on people below.
Work Expert: The furniture looks like it is for a workshop, not an office. Most chairs are not good for people who use keyboards, especially short people. Many chairs are old, you cannot change them, and the armrests stop you from sitting near the desk.
People Expert: There are old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. This place needs to get better. It needs a big clean. They should say when people do good work. The air conditioning must get better now because many people smoke. When we visited, few people were talking; everyone seemed stressed because they had a lot of work to do. The company should help people work in teams.","Is your office a good place to work?

A new study says that fresh air and good chairs are very important for a happy and healthy team. We visited four different offices to see how good they are for people's health and happiness. Our team of experts included a building health expert, a person who studies how people work, and a workplace psychologist. Here is what they thought.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

**Building Health Expert:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no special air system. The windows open to the street. It is hard to understand why this place works well, but the small, busy team seems happy. They change things for the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, just like they might do at home. This could be the reason it works: a team of seven people has made a happy, comfortable office without a lot of rules from others.

**Workplace Expert:** The furniture is all different. Most of it is not good for your posture. The chairs are old, many cannot be adjusted, and some are broken. Even though the furniture is bad, the people have different kinds of work that they control – like office tasks, meeting clients, and giving talks. This variety helps them avoid feeling tired, bored, or having muscle pain.

**Psychologist:** The staff are very happy with the different types of work and the flexible office space. They said the office is 'just the right size' – small enough to know what your coworkers are doing, but big enough to be alone and focus. I thought the office was nice and fun. It felt both efficient and creative.

**Office B: News Service**

**Building Health Expert:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and general condition seem good. A 'No Smoking' rule helps with this.

**Workplace Expert:** I was not surprised to hear the company already asked a workplace expert for advice. The chairs are excellent. The lighting and computer equipment are good. There is enough space, but the arrangement could be better. The environment is not personal or interesting, with plain grey walls.

**Psychologist:** The walls are mostly empty, except for some calendars and a poster. Most staff have worked there for at least five years and get along well. The office could be better if the desks were arranged to help people share information more easily. They could also put success stories or news about new projects on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**

**Building Health Expert:** People in this office have different feelings about it. Inside, it feels like you are in a glass box, looking at many other similar offices. Even though some people smoke in a small space, the air did not feel bad. Standing only 1.5 metres from a smoker, you could not smell the smoke.

**Workplace Expert:** Sadly, the office area is very standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but only just. Not all the chairs for computer work are the right type, but this is the users' choice. Computer screens are often on small desks with low keyboard shelves, which is not good for modern equipment.

**Psychologist:** The staff help each other and have good technology. You can see many awards for good communication on the walls. The wood-coloured walls and brown carpet make it feel a bit serious. The office is full of activity.

**Office D: Newspaper**

**Building Health Expert:** It is hard to find anything good about this building. The air conditioning is very basic, so the temperature changes a lot. The space is messy, and most people do not have enough room on their desks. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to collect. The roof also collects dust, and if it is moved, it falls on the people below.

**Workplace Expert:** The furniture looks like it belongs in a workshop, not a modern company. Most chairs are not good for people who use a keyboard, especially if they are shorter than 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, cannot be adjusted well, and have armrests that stop you from sitting close to the desk.

**Psychologist:** There are old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot to improve. The place needs a good clean. They should recognise people's successes more. The air conditioning needs to be fixed right away because there are many smokers. When we visited, few people were talking; everyone seemed stressed and busy with their work. The company should encourage people to work more as a team.",,,
231,"Plugging in the home

Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She recounts here how she was able to transform the family home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last I turned 37 and realised that time was running out if I wanted to resurrect a career in journalism - which I believed had been washed down the plug-hole ... the technological plug-hole.
A quick glance at my curriculum vitae showed that I was shamefully stuck in the 1980s, when a piece of carbon wedged in between several sheets of paper in a typewriter was the state of the art. It seemed that only a madman would let me loose on a computer in his newsroom. And why did most of the jobs advertised ask for experience in desktop publishing - which I didn't have?
I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar in nuclear physics than attempting to lay out a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators were a mystery to me and I still don't know how to use the timer on the video.
Clearly, there was a gaping hole in what was left of my career and I had to act quickly. Leaving home before the children did would be fraught with obstacles, or so I thought until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a success story you read or hear about that only ever happens to other people, my family and I won a computer package.
Supplied with a laptop computer to free my husband from his desk, and a personal computer for us all, we dived in at the deep end into a strange new world and terms such as cyberspace, Internet and surfing became commonplace in our vocabulary. We took to chatting like old pals via the Internet to strangers around the world. The children forsook the television and I set up a mini-office in a corner of the kitchen with a telephone-answering facility, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem linking me into the information superhighway.
I had everything I would need for working from home - and I could still manage to take the children to school. They were confident with computers from the start, already well versed in them from school. I was much more hesitant, convinced that all my work would disappear without trace if I pressed the wrong button. I could not have been more wrong.
Though far from being adroit, I did manage to learn the basic skills I needed - il was all so logical, easy and idiot-proof. And, like everything that you persevere with, you learn a little more each day.
I recently began freelancing for a magazine, contributing about two articles a month, and I have become smug in the knowledge that I have the best of two worlds.
So how has the computer helped me? Since my schooldays I have always worked at a desk that can only be described as a chaotic mess. 
Consequently, I was always losing scraps of paper containing vital bits of information. The computer has transformed me into an organised worker, particularly when it comes to office administration.
Spreadsheets help keep a record of income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads have saved me a lol of time and effort. For a journalist, getting on-line with the Internet means I can research stories, ask for further information on the bulletin board in the journalism or publishing forums and even discuss the pros and cons of working from home with people from all over the world.
If all this sounds too good to be true, there is a dark side to computing from home. You can be in isolation from physical human contact. There are the distractions of putting urgent jobs about the house first, and when the children are home there are power struggles in our house over whose turn it is to use the computer.
However, there is a growing band of people who have recently bought multi-media PCs, not just for the educational, leisure and entertainment facilities. In my street alone there appears to be a new type of technical cottage industry evolving from the sheer convenience of not having to join the commuter struggle into the city each day. So what characterises home workers as we move into the next century?
A report entitled PC Usage in UK Homes provides the following profile of the millennium computer user: 38 and well educated; 93% own a personal computer and 32% have a CD-ROM device; 38% have a laser printer and 50% a modem.
Taking this into account, I seem to be well ahead of schedule. And who knows, one day I might be e-mailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or, better still, publishing my own magazine from home. It seems the sky, or should I say cyberspace is the limit.",C1,,"Georgina McGuinness did not work as a journalist for a long time. She did not know about new technology. Here, she tells how she made her home a good place to work.

Two Christmases ago, I was 37. I knew I needed to start my job again soon. I thought my career was finished because of new technology.

I looked at my old jobs. They were from a long time ago. In the 1980s, I used a typewriter. I thought no one would give me a job because I could not use a computer. Many jobs asked for computer skills. I did not have them.

I thought learning about computers was very hard. I did not like technology. I could not use a simple calculator. I also did not know how to use the video player.

I knew I had a big problem with my job. I needed to do something fast. I thought it was difficult to work in an office because of my children. But then, I entered a competition in a local newspaper. My family won a computer. It was a big surprise.

We got a small computer for my husband and a big computer for the family. We started to learn about this new thing. We learned words like 'Internet'. We started talking to people in other countries on the computer. My children watched less TV. I made a small office in the kitchen. I had a phone, a fax machine, and a modem for the Internet.

Now I had everything to work from home. I could also take my children to school. My children were good with computers from the start. They learned at school. I was slow. I was scared to press the wrong button and lose my work. But I was wrong.

I was not very good, but I learned the basic things. It was easy. When you try every day, you learn more.

Now, I write two stories each month for a magazine. I am happy because I can work and be at home.

How did the computer help me? In school, my desk was always messy. I often lost important papers. The computer helped me become a tidy worker.

I use the computer to write down my money. I use it to write bills and letters. This saves me time. As a journalist, I use the Internet to find information for my stories. I can ask questions online. I can talk to people everywhere about working from home.

But working from home on a computer is not always good. Sometimes, you can feel alone. Sometimes, I clean the house when I should work. When my children are home, we sometimes argue about who can use the computer.

More people are buying computers now. They do not just use them for fun or school. On my street, people are starting to work from home. They do not need to go to the city for work.

A report tells us about people who use computers at home. They are often 38 years old and went to college. Most have a computer. Many have other things like printers.

I think I am doing well. Maybe one day I will send my work by computer to a newspaper in another country. Or maybe I will make my own magazine from home. Anything is possible.","Getting back to work at home

Georgina McGuiness had not worked as a journalist for a long time and she felt she didn't understand new technology. Here, she explains how she changed her family home into a good place to work.

Two Christmases ago, I was 37 years old. I realised that if I wanted to be a journalist again, I needed to do it soon. I thought my career was completely finished because of technology.
When I looked at my CV, I saw that my skills were very old. They were from the 1980s, when typewriters were the best technology. I thought no newspaper would let me use their computer. And why did so many job advertisements ask for 'desktop publishing' skills? I didn't have them.
I felt I had a better chance of teaching a class about nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was the person in my family who was worst with technology. Even simple calculators were difficult for me. I still don't know how to set the timer on the video player.
It was clear there was a big problem with my career, and I needed to do something fast. I thought it would be very difficult to get a job outside the home before my children were older. But then, I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a lucky story that you think only happens to other people, my family won a computer.
We got a laptop for my husband, so he didn't always have to work at his desk, and a PC for the family. We started learning about a strange new world. Words like 'cyberspace', 'Internet' and 'surfing' became normal for us. We started talking to people all over the world online, like they were old friends. The children watched less TV. I made a small office in a corner of the kitchen. I had an answering machine, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet.
I had everything I needed to work from home, and I could still take my children to school. They were confident with computers from the beginning because they used them at school. I was much more nervous. I was sure I would lose all my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I was completely wrong.
I wasn't very skilled, but I did learn the basic things I needed to know. It was all very logical, easy and safe to use. And, like with anything you keep trying, you learn a little more every day.
I recently started working for myself, writing for a magazine. I write about two articles each month. I feel very pleased because I have the best parts of both my work life and my home life.
So, how has the computer helped me? Since I was at school, my desk has always been very messy.
Because of this, I was always losing small pieces of paper with important information. The computer has made me an organised worker, especially for office jobs.
I use spreadsheets to keep a record of the money I earn and spend. Ready-made invoices and letter paper have saved me a lot of time and work. For a journalist, using the Internet means I can research stories, ask for more information on special websites, and even talk to people everywhere about the good and bad things about working from home.
If this all sounds too perfect, there are some problems with working on a computer from home. You can feel alone because you don't see other people. It is also easy to do jobs around the house first instead of your work. And when the children are home, we often argue about whose turn it is to use the computer.
However, more and more people are buying computers. They don't just use them for learning and fun. On my street, it seems a new type of home business is starting because it is so convenient. People don't have to travel to the city for work every day. So, what are home workers like as we get closer to the next century?
A report about computer use in UK homes gives this picture of a typical computer user: 38 years old and well educated; 93% have a PC and 32% have a CD-ROM; 38% have a laser printer and 50% have a modem.

Georgina McGuiness had taken an extended break from her career in journalism and felt she had fallen behind with technological developments. In this account, she describes how she managed to turn her family home into a productive workplace.

Two Christmases ago, I celebrated my 37th birthday and understood that time was limited if I wanted to revive my career in journalism – a career I believed had been destroyed by advancing technology.
A quick review of my CV revealed that my skills were embarrassingly outdated, rooted in the 1980s when typewriters represented the latest technology. It seemed unlikely that any employer would trust me to use a computer in a modern newsroom. Furthermore, I noticed that most job advertisements required desktop publishing experience, which I completely lacked.
I felt I would have an easier time leading a seminar on nuclear physics than attempting to design a page on a computer. Within my family, I was known as the technophobe; even basic calculators confused me, and I still had no idea how to program the video recorder.
It was clear that my career prospects were limited, and I needed to take immediate action. I assumed that leaving home for work before my children went to school would present numerous challenges. My perspective changed when I entered a competition organized by a local newspaper. Much like those success stories you hear about that never happen to you, my family unexpectedly won a complete computer system.
Equipped with a laptop to free my husband from his desk and a personal computer for family use, we suddenly found ourselves in an unfamiliar digital world. Terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became regular parts of our vocabulary. We began communicating with strangers worldwide through online chats. The children reduced their television viewing, and I established a compact office in a kitchen corner, complete with an answering machine, fax machine, CD-ROM drive, and a modem connecting me to the information superhighway.
I now possessed everything necessary to work from home while maintaining my ability to take the children to school. They adapted to computers immediately, having gained experience at school. I approached technology with much greater caution, convinced that pressing the wrong key would erase all my work permanently. This assumption proved completely incorrect.
Although I never became particularly skilled, I successfully learned the essential functions I needed – the system proved logical, straightforward, and designed to prevent user errors. As with any skill you practice consistently, my understanding improved gradually each day.
I recently began working as a freelance contributor for a magazine, producing approximately two articles monthly. I feel particularly satisfied knowing I've achieved an ideal balance between my professional and personal life.
How exactly has the computer transformed my work? Since my school years, I've always maintained an extremely disorganized workspace. Consequently, I frequently misplaced important notes containing crucial information. The computer has revolutionized my working habits, especially regarding administrative tasks.
Spreadsheets help me monitor income and expenditures, while pre-designed invoices and letterheads save considerable time and effort. As a journalist, Internet access enables me to research stories, request additional information through specialized forums, and debate the advantages and disadvantages of remote work with people across the globe.
If this sounds excessively positive, working from home with computers does present certain challenges. The physical isolation from colleagues can become difficult. Household chores often distract from urgent work assignments, and when the children return home, we frequently negotiate whose turn it is to use the computer.
Nevertheless, increasing numbers of people are purchasing multimedia computers for purposes beyond education and entertainment. On my street alone, a new form of home-based industry appears to be emerging, made possible by avoiding the daily commute to the city. What characteristics will define homeworkers as we approach the new century?
A report titled ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" outlines the profile of typical computer users around the millennium: 38 years old with higher education; 93% own personal computers while 32% have CD-ROM drives; 38% use laser printers and 50% have modems.
Considering these statistics, I appear to be ahead of current trends. Perhaps someday I'll be emailing columns to newspapers in Melbourne or, even better, publishing my own magazine from home. The possibilities appear limitless – or perhaps I should say, cyberspace is the limit.",,

Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home.

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain's least-known ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of 'green' men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second, appropriately enough, is Britain's greenest dwelling, the 'autonomous house', designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, together with that of their three teenage children and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. You could easily miss the traditional-looking house, roofed with clay pantiles, on a verdant corner plot 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to echo the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and won approval from the planners even though it is in a conservation area.
Ring the solar-powered doorbell and there is total silence. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off (at Robert's insistence), there is a monastic stillness. It is a sunny summer's day, the windows are closed and the conservatory is doing its normal job of warming the air before it ventilates the house. Vale apologises and moves through the house, opening ingenious ventilation shafts and windows. You need to create draughts because draught-proofing is everywhere: even Edison and Faraday have their own air-locked miniature door. 
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They began by designing a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. Then they got carried away and decided to do without mains water as well. They designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water, which they pass through two filters before use. Water from washing runs into the garden (the Vales don't have a dishwasher because they believe it is morally unacceptable to use strong detergents). Most details have a similar statement in mind. 
'We wanted people to see that it was possible to design a house which would be far less detrimental to the environment, without having to live in the dark,' says Robert. 'It would not be medieval.' The house's only medieval aspect is aesthetic: the hall, which includes the hearth and the staircase, rises the full height of the building.
The Vales pay no water bills. And last winter the house used only nine units of electricity a day costing about 70p -- which is roughly what other four bedroomed houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less, when PS20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and generating equipment arrive and are erected in the garden. The house will draw electricity from the mains supply for cooking and running the appliances, but will generate a surplus of electricity. There will even be enough, one day, to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales claim not to use except in the very coldest winter.
So is it warm in winter? One night in February when I happened to call on him, Robert was sitting reading. It was too warm to light the fire, he said. The room temperature on the first floor was 18C, less than the generally expected temperature of living areas, but entirely comfortable, he claimed, because there are no draughts, no radiant heat loss, since everything you touch is at the same temperature. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady in the early years of the twentieth century was entirely comfortable at 12.5C, he says, because of the insulation provided by her clothing. Those people who live in pre-1900 housing, he suggests, should simply go back to living as people did then. Somehow, it is difficult to think of this idea catching on. 
The house's secret is that it is low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build -- it cost the same price per square metre as low-cost housing for rent. Not surprisingly, the commercial building companies are determinedly resisting this idea.",C1,,"Solar Survivor

Charles Clover visits Britain's most green home.

Southwell in Nottinghamshire has two special things. First, there is an old church called Southwell Minster. Second, there is Britain's greenest house. Robert and Brenda Vale made this house.

The Vales use rain water for washing and drinking. They make their waste into garden food. They heat their house with heat from machines and from their bodies. Their three children and two cats also help to heat the house. The house looks like other old houses. It has a clay roof. It is near the church. The house is the same colour as the town's old buildings.

The house is very quiet inside. It has special windows that stop sound. You must take off your shoes inside. On a sunny day, the house gets warm from the sun. Vale opens windows and special holes to let air move. The house has no cold air coming in. Even the cats have their own small door.

The Vales teach building design at a university. They cared about the earth before other people did. They wrote a book about green houses many years ago. They wanted to build a house that did not make bad air. They also decided not to use city water. They use rain water, which they clean. Water from washing goes into the garden. They do not have a dishwasher because they think cleaning liquids are bad.

Robert says, ""We wanted to show people that you can make a house that is good for the earth. You don't have to live in a dark place. It is not like a very old house."" The house has one big room that goes up to the roof. This is the only part that looks old.

The Vales do not pay for water. Last winter, the house used only a little electricity. Soon, they will put sun panels in the garden. The house will make more electricity than it needs. One day, they might even power an electric car. They have a small wood fire for heat, but they almost never use it.

Is the house warm in winter? One cold night, Robert was reading inside. It was too warm to light the fire. The air was 18C. This feels warm because there is no cold air. Robert says people long ago were warm in colder houses because they wore more clothes. But people today probably don't want to do this.

The house is simple and does not use new machines. Everything came from a local shop and local workers built it. This made the house cheap to build. Big building companies do not like this idea.","Solar Survivor

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, cared about the environment long before it became a political issue. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called The Autonomous House. They started by designing a building that produced no carbon dioxide. Then they decided to also live without public water supply. They designed composting toilets, put rainwater tanks in the basement, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean, which they filter twice before using. Water from washing goes into the garden (the Vales don't own a dishwasher because they think it's wrong to use strong cleaning chemicals). Most details in the house have a similar purpose.

'We wanted to show that it was possible to design a house that was much better for the environment, without having to live in darkness,' says Robert. 'It wouldn't be like the Middle Ages.' The only old-fashioned feature is the design: the main hall, with the fireplace and stairs, goes all the way up to the roof.

The Vales don't pay for water. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity per day, costing about 70p – similar to what other four-bedroom houses use without heating. Soon it will use even less, when expensive solar water heating panels and electricity equipment are installed in the garden. The house will take electricity from the public supply for cooking and appliances, but will produce extra electricity. One day, there might even be enough to power an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales say they only use in the coldest weather.

So is the house warm in winter? One February evening when I visited, Robert was sitting and reading. He said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature upstairs was 18°C, lower than in most homes, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no drafts and everything you touched was the same temperature. How warm you feel depends on these things. He explained that a woman in the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggests that people living in houses built before 1900 should live as people did then. It's hard to imagine this idea becoming popular.

The secret of the house is that it uses simple technology and very little can break. Almost everything was bought from a building supplier and put in by local workers. This made the house cheap to build – it cost the same per square metre as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies strongly oppose this idea.",,

Health farms and country house hotels offering spa facilities report that business is booming. We asked five journalists to check out some of the places that are available.

A. HENLOW GRANGE

I welcomed the opportunity to go to Henlow Grange for six days as I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the main part of the huge 18th-century house was the most comfortable possible and I was instantly soothed.
On Day One I did nothing and slept lots. But from Day Two I started going to body conditioning and doing as many classes as I could (stretch and tone, yoga, body alignment, to name but a few). All the instructors are highly trained. I couldn't believe how supple I began to feel as the week progressed.
They have every possible treatment, including aromatherapy (I've never been so relaxed), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial, which lasts for an hour, really does make you feel like a new person.
The staff in the treatment rooms deserve a bouquet. T hey couldn't have been friendlier, nicer or more professional. The whole atmosphere is one of vitality and enthusiasm. Henlow are planning a major refurbishment this year, which will include a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available and you can ride around the grounds. If you're not feeling energetic and the weather's on your side, grab a magazine or enjoy a peaceful walk in the garden.
During my stay, my mood improved and so did my appetite. l left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted for ages. I'm definitely due another visit. This is the perfect break for the stressed working woman. Save
Room 5 for me!

B. SHRUBLAND HALL

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was evident from the moment I climbed the vast staircase into the reception area. The Hall has an impressively decorated library, a charming conservatory and lots of space, so you don't have to speak to anyone if you don't want to.
On arrival everybody is given a medical, which includes an examination and a check on weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which I found a bit disquieting as I'm in good health. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem discovered in the examination was immediately passed on to the fitness instructor and we worked on it in the group workshops and also in an extra session of individual instruction.
Each patient is given a specific diet to follow. Although I lost weight without fasting, I was still hungry enough to develop a fierce headache on the second day. A typical daily menu for me was a breakfast of grapefruit and honey, hot lemon and boiled water; a choice of salads for lunch; and a mixture of exotic fruit, yoghurt and a flask of hot broth for supper. If you're not fasting or on a light diet, then you'll eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and nicely presented, so you needn't suffer too much! You have a massage or water therapy on alternate days. All extra treatments are competitively priced.

C. CAREYS MANOR

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't pretend to be. It's a fine old manor farm with inviting log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're counting calories, you'll have to miss out on the gourmet food. Rich sauces and delightful creamy confections are conjured up by the French chef. It's a good job the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and soft-water pool so I could work off some of the tempting indulgences. (You can opt for a 'health-conscious' diet if you really want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got an expert opinion on an old, sometimes painful, shoulder injury. The physiotherapist recommended good posture, remedial exercises and massage. Carey's manages to be comfortable and luxurious, laid-back and sedate. If you want to break out, there is great surrounding countryside to explore.

Cliveden is a majestic country home and is also a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and much more. There are stunning woodland walks and gardens around the 376-acre National Trust estate.
And there's Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant with dishes to make you clutch your stomach. In ecstasy. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu; the choice was staggering. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice-cream. I climbed into bed a happy woman!
Next morning I dutifully spent a few hours in the gym playing with exercise equipment to burn off a few calories in time for my next meal. In the Pavilion I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils. Then I had an aromatherapy massage. 
I thought of all the other reports my fellow journalists would make, about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone and firm the body. Cliveden has all these if you want to use them -- before indulging yourself at Waldo's.

E. SPRINGS HYDRO

The best and the worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it really is the most delicious I've ever tasted. The worst, because it's a huge slab of 360 calories, which sets you back if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the fabulous aromatherapy massage. I chose the relaxing oils blend, dropped off to sleep twice during the massage, floated back to my room and had my most refreshing night's sleep in years.
The premises are modern and purpose-built, efficiently run, with up-to-the-minute facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are plenty of therapists and beauty rooms so there's little difficulty in scheduling appointments. A variety of treatments are on offer, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are an eclectic mix -- from entire football teams to mums and daughters, best friends and singles. Ideally, I would have a break here about once a month.

Health farms and hotels with spas say business is very good. We asked five writers to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**

I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to rest. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable and I felt calm straight away.
On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. But from the second day, I started going to exercise classes. I tried as many as I could, like stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. All the teachers are very good. I was surprised how flexible I felt by the end of the week.
They offer many treatments, like aromatherapy (I felt very relaxed), seaweed baths, and manicures. The facial takes an hour and makes you feel like a new person.
The staff in the treatment rooms are excellent. They were very friendly, kind, and professional. The whole place feels full of energy. Henlow is planning some changes this year. They will add a smaller Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can use bicycles to ride around the grounds. If you don't want to be active and the weather is nice, you can read a magazine or take a quiet walk in the garden.
During my stay, I felt happier and I ate more. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy for a long time. I really want to visit again. This is the perfect holiday for a busy working woman. Please keep Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**

This big, old house felt calm and relaxing as soon as I walked up the big stairs to reception. The Hall has a beautiful library, a nice conservatory, and lots of space, so you can be alone if you want.
When you arrive, everyone has a health check. They check your weight and blood pressure. They called us 'patients', which I didn't like because I am healthy. But I was pleased that when they found a problem with my shoulder, they told the fitness instructor. We worked on it in group classes and in a special one-to-one lesson.
Everyone gets a special diet to follow. I lost weight without stopping eating, but I was still hungry and got a bad headache on the second day. My daily food was usually grapefruit and honey for breakfast, a salad for lunch, and fruit with yoghurt and hot soup for dinner. If you are not on a special diet, you eat in the main dining room. The food there is delicious and looks nice, so you won't be too unhappy! You get a massage or water therapy every other day. All other treatments have good prices.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**

Careys is not a health farm and does not say it is. It is a nice old manor house with cosy log fires and a big lounge. If you are watching your weight, you will find the food difficult. The French chef makes rich sauces and lovely creamy desserts. It's a good thing the hotel has a gym and a pool so I could do some exercise. (You can choose a healthy diet if you really want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A popular feature is the sports injury clinic. I got expert advice about an old shoulder injury that sometimes hurts. The physiotherapist told me to have better posture, do special exercises, and have massage. Carey's is comfortable and luxurious, but also relaxed and quiet. If you want to go out, there is beautiful countryside to explore.

Cliveden is a grand country house and a five-star hotel that treats its guests very well. It offers health and beauty treatments, a good gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens in the large National Trust park.
There is also Waldo's, a famous restaurant with amazing food. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice-cream. I went to bed a very happy woman!
The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym using the equipment to burn some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I had a facial with gentle heat and essential oils. Then I had an aromatherapy massage.
I thought about the other reports from the writers, about fitness tests, workouts, and beauty treatments to make your body firmer. Cliveden has all these things if you want them -- before you enjoy a big meal at Waldo's.

A. HENLOW GRANGE

I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to rest. My room in the main part of the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable and I felt calm immediately.
On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. But from the second day, I started going to body conditioning classes and tried to do as many classes as possible (such as stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment). All the teachers are very well trained. I was surprised how flexible I started to feel as the week went on.
They offer every possible treatment, including aromatherapy (I have never felt so relaxed), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial, which takes an hour, really makes you feel like a new person.
The staff in the treatment rooms deserve special thanks. They were extremely friendly, kind, and professional. The whole atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning a big renovation this year, which will include a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available and you can ride around the grounds.

B. SHRUBLAND HALL

The calm and relaxing feeling of this large house was clear from the moment I walked up the big staircase to the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a nice conservatory, and lots of space, so you can avoid talking to people if you prefer.
When you arrive, everyone has a medical check, which includes an examination and checks on weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which I found a bit strange because I am healthy. However, I was pleased that a shoulder problem found during the check was immediately told to the fitness instructor. We worked on it in group classes and also in an extra personal session.
Each patient is given a special diet to follow. Although I lost weight without stopping eating, I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. A typical daily menu for me was breakfast with grapefruit and honey, hot lemon and boiled water; a choice of salads for lunch; and a mix of exotic fruit, yoghurt, and a flask of hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a strict or light diet, you will eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and looks good, so you won't suffer too much! You have a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work.

A.
What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires, an agent of change, a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better, as the early theorists believed. It's not simply about intelligence, either. Pat Dixon, author of the book Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace, says that leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as enhuastic and interested as you are'.
Enthusiasm is a key element and, to convey it and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak out articulately and with conviction. 'It's having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"", maintains Dixon.

B.
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says, 'Most people have a far greater potential for leadership than they realise. The process of becoming a leader is recognising those latent talents, developing them and using them.'
In one sense, we are all born leaders - we just need the right circumstances in which to flourish. While it's quite easy to recognise leadership in the grand sense -- be it in the form of figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Ghandi or even Richard Branson - it may be more difficult to relate it to our own workplace. And yet this quality is now regarded as the cornerstone of effective management.
 

C.
Consider the best and worst boss you've ever had. They may have been equally good at setting objectives, meeting deadlines and budgets. But what about how they achieved them? The best leader will have motivated you and may have given you support. The worst leader would have made you feel like a small cog in the corporate machinery and kept information from you, and then when things went wrong would have reacted as if it were your fault. The first led (very well); the second simply managed (very badly).

D.
Leaders and managers can be seen as different animals. Managers tend to enjoy working according to set boundaries. Leaders create their own horizons. 'A good manager can keep even an inefficient company running relatively smoothly,' writes Micheal Shea, the author of Leadership Rules. 'But a good leader can transform a demoralised organisation - whether it's a company, a football team or a nation.' 

E.
Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. There are definite lessons to be learnt: 
* Leadership is something we do best when we choose to do it. So find out where your passions and convictions lie. Next time you feel inspired to lead, harness the energy it gives you and act on it.
* Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a powerful part of you. Recognise it.
* Collaboration can be fine, but there will be times when firm leadership is required. Experiment with your style. If you are a natural transactor, try being the negotiator. If you always ask for the views of others, try taking the lead. Watch how the outcome is changed by this change in you.
* You have to set goals, then beat them. Look at the demands of your job and define those where being a leader will greatly enhance your effectiveness and career prospects.

F. 
* Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes. Learn how to delegate and motivate; organise and chastise; praise and raise.
* Don't assume that your way of leading will immediately win over colleagues. It may even alienate them. Keep working on your communication skills. You don't have to be liked - but your ideas and accomplishments do.
* Be visible and accessible to those who are important. But bear in mind * You don't have to lead all the time. Be clear on where your contribution is vital and how you can help others to develop as leaders.",C1,"**A. What is a good leader?**

A good leader helps people. A leader helps a team change and do better. It is not about being tall or very smart. A writer, Pat Dixon, says a leader makes things happen with people who like the work.

A good leader is happy about the work. They speak clearly and believe what they say. They say ""I believe"" and not just ""I think"".

**B. You can be a leader**

A teacher, John van Maurik, says many people can be leaders. They need to learn how. We all can be leaders. We need a good place to learn.

We know big leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst. But leaders are important at work too. It is a big part of a good boss.

**C. Your best boss and worst boss**

Think about your best boss and your worst boss. They could both do the work. But how did they do it?

The best boss helped you and made you feel happy. The worst boss made you feel bad. They did not tell you things. When there was a problem, they said it was your fault. The first was a good leader. The second was a bad boss.

**D. Leaders and bosses are not the same**

Bosses and leaders are different. A boss likes to work with rules. A leader makes new rules.

A writer, Michael Shea, says a good boss can make a bad company work. But a good leader can change a sad team. This can be a company or a football team.

**E. Learn to be a better leader**

You can learn to be a better leader. Here are some ideas:

*   Be a leader when you want to be. Do work that you like. Use your happy feelings to lead.
*   Think ""I am a leader"". It is a strong part of you.
*   It is good to work with others. But sometimes you must be the leader. Try new ways. If you talk a lot, try to listen. If you listen a lot, try to talk. See how things change.
*   Make goals. Then do better than your goals. See where you can be a leader at work. It will help you.

**F. More ideas for leaders**

*   You learn to lead by leading. You must try and sometimes be wrong. Learn to give work to other people. Learn to help your team. Learn to say ""good"" and ""no"".
*   Your team may not like your way at first. Keep talking to them. They do not have to like you, but they must know your ideas.
*   Be with your team. Talk to them. But remember: you do not have to lead all the time. Know when your help is very important. Help other people be leaders too.",,"Career Power

Get ahead - encourage yourself to take full control at work.

A.
What makes a good leader? A leader is someone who inspires others, makes changes, and shows the way forward. Leadership is not about where you come from or how tall you are. It is also not just about being clever. Pat Dixon, who wrote the book Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace, says that leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as excited and interested as you are'.
Being enthusiastic is very important. To share this feeling and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak clearly and with strong belief. 'It's having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"",' says Dixon.

B.
John van Maurik, who runs a course on Leadership in Management, says, 'Most people can be better leaders than they think. Becoming a leader means finding those hidden skills, making them better, and using them.'
In a way, we are all born leaders - we just need the right situation to grow. It is easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson. But it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. Still, this quality is now seen as very important for good management.

C.
Think about the best and worst boss you have ever had. They may have both been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines and budgets. But how did they do it? The best leader would have motivated you and given you support. The worst leader would have made you feel unimportant, kept information from you, and blamed you when things went wrong. The first was a true leader; the second was just a manager.

D.
Leaders and managers can be very different. Managers usually like working within clear rules. Leaders create their own path. 'A good manager can keep a company running well, even if it is not very efficient,' writes Michael Shea, the author of Leadership Rules. 'But a good leader can change an unhappy organisation - whether it is a company, a football team, or a country.'

E.
Whether you are the boss or a manager, you can do better by improving your leadership skills. Here are some important things to learn:
* We are best at leadership when we choose to do it. So find what you really care about. Next time you feel ready to lead, use that energy and do something.
* Start to see yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a strong part of who you are. Believe in it.
* Working with others is good, but sometimes you need to be a strong leader. Try different ways of leading. If you usually make deals, try to be the one who finds solutions. If you always ask others for their opinions, try making the decisions yourself. See how this changes the results.
* You need to set goals and then do better than them. Look at your job and see where being a leader will help you do better and improve your career.

F.
* Leadership does not just appear. It grows when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from your mistakes. Learn how to give tasks to others and encourage them; organise and correct; praise and help people improve.
* Do not think that your way of leading will make your colleagues agree with you straight away. It might even make them not like it. Keep improving how you talk to people. You do not need everyone to like you - but they should respect your ideas and what you achieve.
* Be easy to find and talk to for the people who matter. But remember: You do not have to lead all the time. Be clear about where you are really needed and how you can help others become leaders too.",,,
235,"Science flying in the face of gravity

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories.

It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft.
But appearances were deceptive and the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel.
There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places with the air of condemned men.
For 12 months, they had competed with other students from across the continent to participate in the flight. The challenge, offered by the European Space Agency, had been to suggest imaginative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions.
Those with the best ideas won a place on this unusual flight, which is best described as the most extraordinary roller-coaster ride yet devised. For the next two hours the Boeing's flight would resemble that of an enormous bird which had lost its reason, shooting upwards towards the heavens before hurtling towards Earth.
The intention was to achieve a kind of state of grace at the top of each curve. As the pilot cuts the engines at 3,000 metres, the aircraft throws itself still higher by virtue of its own momentum before gravity takes over and it plummets earthwards again.
In the few silent seconds between ascending and falling, the aircraft and everything inside it become weightless, and the 13 students would, in theory, feel themselves closer to the moon than the Earth. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor.
Then the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. For 20 seconds we conducted a ghostly dance in the unreal silence:the floor had become a vast trampoline, and one footstep was enough to launch us headlong towards the ceiling.
We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else.
After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.
Our first curve completed, there were those who turned green at the thought of the 29 to follow. Thirty curves added up to ten minutes 'space time' for experiments and the Dutch students were soon studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, hoping to discover how it is that cats always land on their feet.
At the appropriate moment the device they had built to investigate this was released, floating belly-up, and one of the students succeeded in turning it belly-down with radio-controlled movements. The next curve was nearly its last, however, when another student landed on top of it during a less well managed return to gravitational pull.
Next to the slightly stunned acrobatic robocat, a German team from the University of Aachen investigated how the quality of joins in metal is affected by the absence of gravity, with an eye to the construction of tomorrow's space stations.
Another team of students, from Utah State University, examined the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened in ultra-violet sunlight. Their flight was spent attempting to produce the films under microgravity. They believe that once the process is perfected, satellites could be equipped with solar sails that use the sun's radiation just as a yacht's sails use the wind. 
After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.
This was a feeling that would stay with us for a long time. 'It was an unforgettable experience,' said one of the students. 'I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more.'",C1,,,"Science against gravity

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness.

From the outside, it looked like a normal airplane. The pilot told the young people that it was made in 1964. It was a Boeing KC-135, a plane that gives fuel to other planes, and it was based on a Boeing 707 passenger plane.
But the outside was misleading. The 13 students from Europe and America who got on the plane were about to have a very special flight. Inside, the plane was like a long, white tunnel.
There were almost no windows. Light came from the soft walls, making it look strange. Most of the seats were gone, except for a few at the back. The young scientists, who looked a bit scared, sat there.
For a year, they had tried to win a competition against other students from Europe. The European Space Agency asked for creative experiments to do without gravity.
The students with the best ideas won a seat on this special flight. It was like the most amazing roller coaster ever made. For two hours, the plane flew like a crazy bird, going high up into the sky and then falling down fast towards the ground.
The goal was to reach a moment of weightlessness at the highest point of each climb. The pilot turned off the engines at 3,000 meters. The plane kept going up because of its speed, and then gravity pulled it down again.
For a few quiet seconds between going up and falling down, the plane and everything inside it had no weight. The 13 students felt, in theory, closer to the moon than to Earth. The plane took off smoothly, but we soon realized it was not a normal flight. The pilot made the plane climb at a 45-degree angle for about 20 seconds. The engines made a lot of noise, the blood left our heads, and we fell onto the floor.
Then the engines stopped, and we became weightless almost immediately. For 20 seconds, we danced in a strange silence. The floor was like a big trampoline. One step sent us flying towards the ceiling.
We floated around without direction. The idea of moving to a specific place was confusing. Left, right, up, and down didn't mean anything anymore. Gravity usually holds us in place and lets us understand how to go somewhere else.
After ten seconds of falling, the pilot made the plane level again. Gravity returned, not as fast as it left, but still suddenly. Some students fell down hard.
After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. The 30 curves gave ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students watched their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet.
At the right time, they let their machine go. It floated with its belly up. One student used a remote control to turn it belly-down. But the next curve was almost a disaster when another student fell on top of it when gravity returned.
Near the surprised robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how gravity affects the way metal pieces join together. They want to help build future space stations.
Another team, from Utah State University, looked at making solar sails from thin liquid that gets hard in sunlight. They tried to make these films without gravity. They think that one day, satellites could use these sails to catch the sun's energy, like a boat's sails catch the wind.
After two hours of going up and down, our breakfast felt a bit strange in our stomachs, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness.
This feeling stayed with us for a long time. ""It was an experience I will never forget,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more.""","Science Defying Gravity

236,"The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action.

One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. 'Hasn't even acknowledged us,' Sue Brown says out of the corner of her mouth. 'Very poor.' It is a classic arrival-phase error, and one that Sue has encountered scores of times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't an ordinary three-star place,' she protests. 'It has three red stars, and I would expect better.'
To be the possessor of red stars means that the Globe is rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide published by the organisation she works for. However, even before our frosty welcome, a chill has entered the air. Access from the car park has been via an unmanned door, operated by an impersonal buzzer, followed by a long, twisting, deserted corridor leading to the hotel entrance. 'Again, not what I had expected,' says Sue.
Could things get worse? They could. 'We seem to have no record of your booking,' announces the receptionist, in her best sing-song how-may-I-help-you voice.
It turns out that a dozen of the hotel's 15 rooms are unoccupied that night. One is on the top floor. It is not to the inspector's taste: stuffiness is one criticism, the other is a gaping panel at the back of the wardrobe, behind which is a large hole in the wall.
When she began her inspecting career, she named an early reputation for toughness. 'The Woman in Black, I was known as,' she recalls, 'which was funny, because I never used to wear black. And I've never been too tough.' Not that you would know it the next morning when, after paying her bill, she suddenly reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves.
From the look on his face, her arrival has caused terror.
Even before she says anything else, he expresses abject apologies for the unpleasant smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocks drain there,' he sighs. 'The whole floor will probably have to come up.` Sue gently suggests that as well as sorting out the plumbing, he might also prevail upon his staff not to usher guests into the room so readily. 'Best, perhaps, to steer them to the other lounge.' she says. Greaves nods with glum enthusiasm and gamely takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months, and you can see him struggling to believe Sue when she says that this dissection of the hotel can only be for the good of the place in the long run.
Not that it's all on the negative side. Singled out for commendation are Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who dished out a sheaf of notes about the building's 400-year history. Dinner, too, has done enough to maintain the hotel's two-rosette food rating, thereby encouraging Greaves to push his luck a bit. 'So what do we have to do to get three rosettes?' he enquires. Sue's suggestions include: 'Not serve a pudding that collapses.' The brief flicker of light in Greaves' eyes goes out.
It is Sue Brown's unenviable job to voice the complaints the rest of us more cowardly consumers do not have the courage to articulate. 'Sometimes one can be treading on very delicate ground. I remember, in one case, a woman rang to complain I'd got her son the sack. All I could say was the truth, which was that he'd served me apple pie with his fingers.' Comeback letters involve spurious allegations of everything, from a superior attitude to demanding bribes. 'You come to expect it after a while, but it hurts every time,' she says.
Sue is required not just to relate her findings to the hotelier verbally, but also to send them a full written report. They are, after all, paying for the privilege of her putting them straight. (There is an annual fee for inclusion in the guide.) Nevertheless, being singled out for red-star treatment makes it more than worthwhile. So it is reassuring for Greaves to hear that Sue is not going to recommend that the Globe be stripped of its red stars. That is the good news. The bad is that another inspector will be back in the course of the next two months to make sure that everything has been put right. 'Good,' smiles Greaves unconvincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.'",C1,"The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown visits hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watches her.

At the Globe Hotel, things go wrong quickly. A woman works at the front desk. She is on the phone. She does not look at Sue. Sue says this is not good. Sue has visited hotels for 11 years. She sees this problem many times.

The hotel has three red stars. This means it is a very good hotel. But Sue sees problems. First, the door from the car park has no person. Then, there is a long hall to the hotel. Sue is not happy.

Then, more problems. The woman at the front desk says, ""I cannot find your name.""

The hotel has 15 rooms. 12 rooms have no people. Sue sees a room at the top. She does not like the room. The air is not good. There is a big hole in the wall.

The next morning, Sue pays. Then she tells the hotel boss, Robin Greaves, her name. He looks afraid.

He says sorry for a bad smell in a room. He says a pipe is broken. Sue says workers should not take guests to that room. They should use a different room. Mr. Greaves writes this down. He is new at the hotel. Sue says her visit will help the hotel later.

But some things are good. Sue says two workers are very good: Emma and Trudy. Trudy gave papers about the hotel's old history. The food is good. It has two stars. Mr. Greaves asks, ""How do we get three stars?"" Sue says, ""Do not serve a sweet that falls down."" Mr. Greaves looks sad.

Sue's job is to say what is bad. Sometimes people get angry. One time, a woman called Sue. She said Sue made her son lose his job. Sue told the truth: he used his hand to give her apple pie.

Sue must tell the hotel what she thinks. She also writes a long paper. The hotel pays to be in her book. The red stars are very good for the hotel.

Sue tells Mr. Greaves she will not take the red stars away. This is good news. The bad news is another person will come to check the hotel again soon. Mr. Greaves says, ""Good. We will be happy for that."" But he does not look happy.","The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown checks hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watched her work.

The hotel check starts, and there are already problems at the Globe Hotel. The woman at the front desk is talking on the phone. She does not know who Sue is. She does not say hello to them. ""Very bad,"" Sue Brown says quietly. This is a mistake Sue sees often. She has seen it many times in her 11 years checking hotels. ""But this hotel is special,"" she says. ""It has three red stars, so it should be better.""

A red star means the Globe Hotel is one of the best hotels in their book. But before the cold welcome, the hotel did not feel nice. To get inside from the car park, you press a buzzer on a door. Then you walk down a long, empty hallway. ""Again, not what I thought,"" says Sue.

Can it get worse? Yes. ""We cannot find your booking,"" says the woman at the front desk in a nice voice.

The hotel has 15 rooms, but 12 are empty that night. Sue sees a room on the top floor. She does not like it. The air is bad. There is also a big hole in the wall behind the cupboard.

When she started her job, people thought she was very strict. ""They called me The Woman in Black,"" she remembers. ""But I never wore black. And I was not too strict."" The next morning, she pays her bill and tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who she is.

He looks scared.

Before she speaks, he says he is sorry about the bad smell in the main sitting room. ""We think a pipe is broken,"" he says. ""We might have to fix the floor."" Sue says they should fix the pipe. She also says the staff should not take guests to that room. ""Maybe show them to the other sitting room,"" she says. Greaves writes this down. He has only been the manager for five months. He finds it hard to believe that Sue's visit will help the hotel later.

But it is not all bad. Sue says that Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, are very good. The waitress told them about the hotel's old history. The dinner was good. It was good enough to keep the hotel's good food score. This makes Greaves ask, ""What do we need to do to get the best food score?"" Sue says, ""Don't serve a dessert that falls down."" Greaves looks sad.

Sue Brown has a hard job. She says the things that other, more shy, guests are afraid to say. ""Sometimes it is difficult. I remember one time a woman called me. She was angry because I got her son fired. I had to tell the truth. He gave me apple pie with his hands."" Sometimes, hotels write angry letters to her. They say she is not nice or that she asked for money. ""After some time, you know it will happen, but it still feels bad,"" she says.

Sue must tell the hotel manager what she found. She also has to send them a long letter. The hotels pay to be in the book. But having a red star is very good for them. So Greaves is happy to hear that Sue will not take away the hotel's red stars. That is the good news. The bad news is that another person will check the hotel in two months. They will see if the problems are fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a small smile. ""We will be happy to see them.""","The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown's job is to judge hotels. Christopher Middleton watched her work.

The inspection of the Globe Hotel is not going well, and it has only just started. The people at the hotel don't know this yet. The woman at the front desk is talking on the phone and does not see Sue. ""She hasn't even said hello to us,"" Sue Brown says quietly. ""This is very bad."" This is a common mistake, and Sue has seen it many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this hotel is not a normal three-star hotel,"" she says. ""It has three red stars, so I expected better service.""

Red stars mean the Globe is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in her organisation's guide. But even before the cold welcome, the hotel felt unfriendly. To get from the car park to the hotel, you have to use a buzzer to open a door. Then you walk down a long, empty corridor. ""Again, not what I expected,"" says Sue.

Could it get worse? Yes. ""We don't seem to have your booking,"" says the woman at the front desk in a friendly voice.

It turns out that 12 of the hotel's 15 rooms are empty that night. Sue sees a room on the top floor. She does not like it. The air is stuffy and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

When she started her job, people thought she was very tough. ""They called me The Woman in Black,"" she remembers. ""That was funny because I never wore black. And I was never too tough."" But the next morning, the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, looks terrified when she tells him who she is.

Before she can say anything else, he says he is very sorry about the bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think a drain is blocked,"" he says. ""We will probably have to take the floor out."" Sue kindly says that while he fixes the drain, he should also ask his staff not to take guests into that room. ""It is better to take them to the other lounge,"" she says. Greaves sadly agrees and writes notes. He has only been the manager for five months. He finds it hard to believe Sue when she says that her inspection will help the hotel in the future.

But not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a young waitress who gave them lots of information about the hotel's 400-year history. The dinner was good enough to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating. This makes Greaves feel a little hopeful. ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" he asks. One of Sue's suggestions is: ""Don't serve a pudding that falls apart."" The hope in Greaves' eyes disappears.

Sue Brown has a difficult job. She has to say the complaints that other, more nervous, guests are too afraid to say. ""Sometimes you can upset people. I remember one time a woman called to say I got her son fired. I had to tell the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers."" Sometimes hotels write angry letters to her, saying she has a superior attitude or that she asked for money. ""After a while you expect these letters, but they still hurt,"" she says.

Sue must tell the hotel manager what she found, and she also has to send them a long written report. The hotels pay to be in the guide, so they are paying for her advice. Having red stars makes this worth it. So Greaves is happy to hear that Sue will not tell the organisation to take away the hotel's red stars. That is the good news. The bad news is that another inspector will visit in the next two months to check that all the problems are fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with an unconvincing smile. ""We will look forward to that.""","The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown evaluates hotels professionally. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection.

Within the first minute of the annual inspection, problems are already emerging at the Globe Hotel, though the staff remain unaware. The receptionist is occupied with a phone call, quoting room rates to a potential guest, completely ignoring the real guest standing before her. 'She hasn't even acknowledged our presence,' Sue Brown remarks quietly. 'This is very poor.' It is a classic error during the arrival process, one Sue has witnessed countless times over her 11-year career. 'However, this isn't an ordinary three-star establishment,' she notes. 'It holds three red stars, so my expectations are higher.'

Possessing red stars indicates that the Globe is ranked among the top 130 out of 4,000 hotels in the guide published by her organisation. Yet, even before this unfriendly welcome, the atmosphere was disappointing. Access from the car park involved an unmanned door operated by a buzzer, followed by a long, winding, and empty corridor leading to the hotel entrance. 'Again, not what I anticipated,' Sue comments.

Could the situation deteriorate further? It could. 'We appear to have no record of your reservation,' the receptionist announces in her most polished customer-service tone.

As it turns out, twelve of the hotel's fifteen rooms are unoccupied that night. Sue is assigned a room on the top floor, which fails to meet her standards. One issue is the stuffy atmosphere; another is a large, exposed panel at the back of the wardrobe, revealing a significant hole in the wall.

Early in her inspecting career, she gained a reputation for being demanding. 'I was known as The Woman in Black,' she recalls. 'This was amusing because I rarely wore black, and I never considered myself excessively strict.' However, you wouldn't guess this the following morning when, after settling her bill, she reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves.

The expression on his face indicates that her presence has caused considerable alarm.

Before she can elaborate, he offers profuse apologies for the unpleasant odour in the main lounge. 'We suspect there is a blocked drain,' he explains with a sigh. 'The entire floor may need to be removed.' Sue gently recommends that, in addition to resolving the plumbing issue, he should encourage his staff to avoid directing guests to that room. 'It would be preferable to guide them to the alternative lounge,' she suggests. Greaves nods with a mixture of gloom and determination, diligently taking notes. Having been at the Globe for only five months, he visibly struggles to accept Sue's assurance that this critical assessment will ultimately benefit the hotel.

Nevertheless, the feedback is not entirely negative. Sue commends Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, a young waitress who provided detailed notes on the building's 400-year history. Furthermore, the dinner quality was sufficient to maintain the hotel's two-rosette food rating. Encouraged by this, Greaves ventures to ask, 'What must we do to achieve three rosettes?' Among Sue's recommendations is, 'Avoid serving a dessert that collapses.' The brief spark of optimism in Greaves' eyes fades immediately.

Sue Brown has the unenviable task of voicing criticisms that more hesitant customers lack the courage to express. 'Occasionally, you find yourself on sensitive ground. I recall one instance where a woman called, accusing me of getting her son fired. I could only state the truth: he had served me apple pie using his bare hands.' She frequently receives complaint letters containing false allegations, ranging from claims of a superior attitude to accusations of soliciting bribes. 'You grow to anticipate it over time, but it remains hurtful on every occasion,' she admits.

Sue is required not only to discuss her findings with the hotelier in person but also to submit a comprehensive written report. After all, hotels pay a fee to be listed in the guide and receive her candid assessment. Despite this, being selected for red-star status makes the process worthwhile. Therefore, it is a relief for Greaves to learn that Sue will not recommend the removal of the Globe's red stars. That is the positive news. The negative is that another inspector will return within two months to verify that all issues have been resolved. 'Good,' Greaves replies with an unconvincing smile. 'We will look forward to that.'",,

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits.

My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

We were in a snow cave 91m below the summit when my climbing partner, Dougal Haston, began a conversation with Dave Clark, our Equipment Officer, about the relative merits of various sleeping bags. I thought this was strange, as only Dougal and I were present. Putting this down to oxygen deprivation, I then found myself talking to my feet. Already the cold was getting into the balls of my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite. It wasn't survival that was worrying us so much as the quality of our survival.
Over the next two days I relived our time spent on the summit ridge. I realised that I couldn't have been there with a better man than Dougal Hatton. He inspired great confidence in me and by now I was climbing with a calm presentiment mat somehow or other it was all going to work out. I realised I had to get a better rhythm going in order to reach the summit - which is what I did.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. In April 1976 Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days humping equipment and food up to the base. Only after the first day of climbing did we realise the enormity of our undertaking. On the lower face we followed a route put up in 1967, but at half height we pursued a new route, as planned, heading directly for the upper snow basin and the summit. We decided to climb
'alpine style', with our equipment and food on our backs. It would be the first time a major new route had been climbed here in such a way.
We climbed up the compressed snow of an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff and by the third day my sleeping bag was sodden. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering. Mt. McKinley, because the air pressure in the polar regions is lower, has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. It seemed to us that we were up at around 7,000m, instead of 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with the intention of climbing Mt. Kenya. It was though the unexpected offer of a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro that we came to climb Africa's highest mountain.
On our approach we got ourselves lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes. Our situation became serious because water is scarce. On the second day we came across luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish which brought us to a rock pool. Never before had I been so pleased to find rubbish on a mountain.
We attempted a direct start to the breach wall, which is a 305m-high icicle. After a deluge of falling rock and ice we prudently retired and opted instead for the Umbwe route to gain the surrealistic summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a party up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the busy standard route, and suggested that we go with them.
After three days of sitting out bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier stretching up to the summit had been swept by vicious winds and glistened with pure ice. With a time limit to get back to Buenos Aires for our flight, we decided to miss out on the glacier. Instead we went across the north ridges towards the standard route and joined the large number of people wandering along the path. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit and just before it got dark we camped outside the refuge.
Back at base camp we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and felt, when they learnt that I had already climbed four, that I should do me same. This was the first time I had seriously thought about such goal-orientation -- something I had previously tried to avoid.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality. Our team left Britain towards the end of November 1992 and travelled the thousands of kilometres to the South Pole. At this time of the year the sun is always well above the horizon, throughout the day and night, and when the wind stops blowing it is utterly quiet. As in other polar regions, in the keen, clean air, there is such an invigorating atmosphere that the spirits are raised just by being there. On December 7 we left camp and headed off towards the summit. Against expectations, with winds gusting at around 80 kms per hour and temperatures below minus 50degC, we all got to the top within 8 hours. Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

Our team assembled in St Petersburg during the early summer of 1994. On our arrival at the settlement of Terskol, beneath Elbrus, a commission was demanded from our guide for bringing foreigners into the valley, though this was later waived. 
After a few days' acclimatising, the group set off up Elbrus by cableway to 3,900m. From there we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-
afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day descended this, fortunately extinct, volcano.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

On our expedition to Carstensz we hoped not only to establish a new route but to spend as much time as possible with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, regarded as sacred by the local tribespeople.
We had been warned that we might be taken hostage or even killed by bandits but, undeterred, we left our hut by mid-morning and walked down winding lanes towards the jungle. On May 12 we stayed climbing. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We were slower, since Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am. 
I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!",C1,,"**Seven Up**

Mountaineer Doug Scott tells readers about his amazing experience of climbing the highest mountain on each continent: the Seven Summits.

I decided to climb the Seven Summits when I was older. I will talk about them in the order I climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**

We were in a snow cave near the top. My climbing partner, Dougal Haston, started talking to a man who was not there. I thought this was strange. I decided it was because the air was bad. Then, I started talking to my own feet. My feet were very cold. I remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes from the cold. We were not just worried about living, but about living well.
Later, I thought about our time near the top. I knew Dougal was the best partner. He made me feel safe. I felt calm and believed everything would be okay. I found a better way to climb and reached the top.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**

People say this is the most dangerous mountain in the world. In 1976, Dougal and I arrived at the glacier. For four days, we carried our things up the mountain. After the first day, we saw how hard it was. We followed an old path at the bottom. Halfway up, we started a new path to the top. We carried all our things on our backs. No one had done a big new path this way before.
We climbed up hard snow and camped under a cliff. Soon, my sleeping bag was very wet. We spent a night on a windy ridge. We both felt very bad. This mountain makes you feel sick because of the air. It felt much higher than it is. We walked to the top and then down the other side. We were very happy.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**

In 1976, my friend Paul and I flew to Africa. We wanted to climb Mt. Kenya. But someone gave us a free ride to Kilimanjaro, so we climbed that mountain instead.
On the way up, we got lost in a thick forest. This was bad because we needed water. On the second day, we saw bright arrows on trees and some rubbish. This showed us the way to water. I was very happy to see that rubbish.
We tried to climb a tall wall of ice. But rocks and ice fell down, so we stopped. We took a different path to the top. The top was strange and beautiful.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**

The normal path up this mountain is like a walk. In 1992, I went with my wife to the mountain. I was happy to meet another climber, Phil. He was taking a group up a different path, and we went with them.
After three days of bad weather, we left our camp. The different path was very windy and icy. We had to catch a flight home, so we did not go that way. We went to the normal path with many other people. The wind was strong as we walked to the top. Before dark, we put up our tent near a building.
Back at camp, we met eight people from a climbing club. They wanted to climb the Seven Summits. They said I should do it too. This was the first time I really thought about this idea.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**

I learned that I could climb this mountain if I guided people to pay for the trip. Then, climbing all seven mountains seemed possible. Our team left Britain in late 1992 and went to the South Pole. At that time, the sun is always up. When the wind stops, it is very quiet. The air is clean and makes you feel happy. On December 7, we walked to the top. The wind was very strong and it was very, very cold. But we all reached the top in 8 hours. We were happy, but we could not see far in the storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**

Our team met in St Petersburg in 1994. We went to a town below the mountain. Someone asked our guide for money because we were foreigners, but then they said it was okay.
After a few days, we took a cable car up the mountain. Then we walked to a hut. Two days later, the wind was strong as we walked on ice. In the afternoon, we reached a high point. But it was not the real top. There was a long walk to the real top. It got dark, so we went back to the hut. The next day we walked down the mountain. This mountain is a volcano, but it is not active.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**

On this trip, we wanted to find a new path and meet the local Dani people. A big gold mine is cutting into the mountain. The local people think the mountain is holy.
People told us that bad men might hurt us. But we were not afraid. We left our hut and walked into the forest. On May 12, we started to climb. The weather got better. Two people from our team went very fast. We were slower because my wife was making a film. We wore special shoes and reached the top at 11 am.
On my seventh mountain top, everyone clapped for me. I did it!","**Seven Up**

Mountaineer Doug Scott tells readers about his amazing experience of climbing the highest mountain on each continent: the Seven Summits.

I decided to climb the Seven Summits later in my life. I will talk about them in the order I climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**

We were in a snow cave 91 meters below the top. My climbing partner, Dougal Haston, started talking to Dave Clark, our Equipment Officer, about different sleeping bags. I thought this was strange because only Dougal and I were there. I thought it was because we didn't have enough oxygen. Then, I started talking to my own feet. My feet were already very cold, and I remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes because of the cold. We weren't just worried about surviving, but about staying healthy.
Over the next two days, I thought a lot about our time near the top. I realized that Dougal was the best person to be with. He made me feel very confident, and I started climbing with a calm feeling that everything would be okay. I knew I needed to find a better rhythm to reach the top – and I did.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**

People think this is the most dangerous mountain in the world. In April 1976, Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier. For four days, we carried equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, we understood how big our task was. On the lower part, we followed a route from 1967. But halfway up, we started a new route, going straight for the top. We decided to climb 'alpine style', carrying all our things on our backs. It was the first time a major new route was climbed there in this way.
We climbed up hard snow to camp under a rocky cliff. By the third day, my sleeping bag was very wet. We spent the third night on a windy ridge; we were both feeling very bad. Mt. McKinley affects the body more than you would expect for its height because of the polar air. It felt like we were at 7,000m, not 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally walked slowly to the top and then down the other side. We were very happy.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. But someone offered us a free ride to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, so we decided to climb Africa's highest mountain instead.
On our way up, we got lost in the thick jungle on the lower slopes. This was a big problem because there was very little water. On the second day, we saw bright arrows painted on trees and a lot of rubbish. This led us to a pool of water. I had never been so happy to see rubbish on a mountain before.
We tried to climb a 305m-high wall of ice directly. After a lot of rock and ice fell down, we wisely stopped. We chose the Umbwe route to the top instead, which was very strange and beautiful.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**

The normal route up Aconcagua is mostly just a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca. I was happy to meet another mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a group up the mountain using the Polish Glacier, away from the busy normal route, and he asked us to join them.
After three days of bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier, which goes up to the top, was very windy and covered in pure ice. We had a time limit to get back to Buenos Aires for our flight, so we decided not to climb the glacier. Instead, we went across the north ridges to the normal route and joined the many people walking there. The wind was strong as we walked the last few meters to the top. Just before it got dark, we camped outside a small building.
Back at base camp, we met eight people from the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They wanted to climb the Seven Summits. When they learned I had already climbed four, they said I should do the same. This was the first time I seriously thought about this goal – something I had not wanted to do before.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**

I learned that climbing Vinson Massif was possible if I guided enough people to pay for the trip. So, trying to climb all Seven Summits became a real plan. Our team left Britain at the end of November 1992 and travelled thousands of kilometres to the South Pole. At that time of year, the sun is always in the sky, day and night. When the wind stopped, it was completely silent. Like in other polar places, the air is very clean and fresh, and it makes you feel happy just to be there. On December 7, we left camp and went towards the top. Even though the wind was very strong, about 80 km per hour, and the temperature was below -50°C, we all reached the top in 8 hours. We were very happy, but we couldn't see very far because of the storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**

Our team met in St Petersburg in the early summer of 1994. When we arrived at the village of Terskol, near Elbrus, some officials wanted money from our guide for bringing foreigners to the valley, but they later said it was okay.
After a few days getting used to the height, the group took a cable car up Elbrus to 3,900m. From there, we walked to a hut at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind pushed us as we crossed open slopes, some of them very icy. In the afternoon, we reached what we thought was the top. But we found there was another long ridge to the real summit. As it got dark, we went back to the hut. The next day we came down this volcano, which is no longer active.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**

On our trip to Carstensz, we wanted to find a new route and also spend time with the local Dani people. The world's biggest gold mine is cutting into the mountain, which the local tribes think is a holy place.
People warned us that bandits might take us hostage or even kill us. But we were not afraid. We left our hut in the late morning and walked down small roads towards the jungle. On May 12, we started climbing. The weather got better, and two of the team went very fast ahead. We were slower because Sharu was making a film. Climbing in special rock shoes, we reached the top by 11 am.
On this, my seventh summit, everyone stood and clapped for me. I had done it","**Seven Up**

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his extraordinary experiences of reaching the highest peak on every continent: the Seven Summits.

I began my quest to climb the Seven Summits relatively late in life. I will describe them in the order I completed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**

We were sheltering in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit when my partner, Dougal Haston, started a discussion with our Equipment Officer, Dave Clark, about the advantages of different sleeping bags. I found this bizarre because only Dougal and I were actually there. Assuming it was due to a lack of oxygen, I then caught myself talking to my own feet. The cold was already affecting my feet, and I remembered other climbers who had suffered frostbite and lost fingers and toes. Our main concern was not just survival, but the condition we would be in if we survived.
Over the next two days, I kept thinking about our time on the summit ridge. I realised there was no one I would have preferred to have with me than Dougal. He gave me great confidence, and by then I was climbing with a calm belief that everything would somehow be alright. I understood that I needed to establish a better climbing rhythm to reach the top, which is exactly what I managed to do.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**

This mountain has a reputation for being the most dangerous in the world. In April 1976, Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying all our equipment and food to the base camp. It was only after the first day of climbing that we truly grasped the scale of the challenge. On the lower section, we followed a route established in 1967, but at the halfway point we began a new route as planned, heading straight for the upper snow basin and the summit. We had chosen to climb in 'alpine style', meaning we carried all our supplies on our backs. This was the first time a significant new route on the mountain had been climbed using this method.
We ascended compacted snow in an avalanche path and camped beneath a rocky cliff. By the third day, my sleeping bag was completely soaked. We spent the third night on an exposed, windy ridge, and by then we were both struggling. Due to lower air pressure in polar regions, Mt. McKinley's effect on the body is much greater than its altitude would suggest. It felt as if we were at 7,000 meters, not 6,100 meters. We packed our gear and eventually, exhausted, we reached the summit and descended the other side, feeling a great sense of achievement.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with the plan to climb Mt. Kenya. However, we were unexpectedly offered free transport to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro, which led us to climb Africa's highest peak instead.
During our approach, we became lost in the dense jungle on the lower slopes. The situation became critical due to a severe lack of water. On the second day, we discovered luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of litter that guided us to a rock pool. I had never been so relieved to find rubbish on a mountain.
We attempted a direct ascent of the Breach Wall, a 305-meter high ice formation. After being hit by falling rock and ice, we wisely turned back and chose the Umbwe route to reach the surreal landscape of the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**

The original, and now standard, route up Aconcagua is little more than a long walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was leading a group up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the crowded main route, and he invited us to join them.
After a three-day delay due to bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier, which leads to the summit, had been scoured by fierce winds and was covered in hard ice. With a deadline to return to Buenos Aires for our flight, we decided to avoid the glacier. Instead, we traversed the north ridges to join the standard route, merging with the large number of people on the path. The wind was powerful as we covered the final meters to the summit, and just before dark we camped outside a mountain refuge.
Back at base camp, we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and, upon learning I had already climbed four, they insisted I should do the same. This was the first time I had seriously considered such a specific goal—something I had typically tried to avoid.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**

I discovered that climbing Vinson Massif was feasible if you guided enough people to cover the high cost of the expedition, which made the goal of all Seven Summits seem achievable. Our team departed Britain in late November 1992 and travelled the immense distance to the South Pole. At that time of year, the sun remains constantly above the horizon. When the wind dropped, the silence was absolute. As in other polar regions, the sharp, clean air creates an invigorating atmosphere that lifts your spirits simply by being there. On December 7th, we left camp for the summit. Contrary to expectations, despite winds of around 80 km/h and temperatures below -50°C, our entire team reached the top within eight hours. Our celebration was slightly subdued because the storm limited visibility to just a few meters.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**

Our team gathered in St Petersburg in the early summer of 1994. Upon arriving at the village of Terskol, near Elbrus, a local official demanded a fee from our guide for bringing foreigners into the area, though this was eventually waived.
After several days of acclimatization, the group took a cable car up Elbrus to 3,900 meters. From there, we hiked to a refuge at 4,200 meters. Two days later, strong winds battered us as we crossed open slopes, some of which were sheer ice. By mid-afternoon, we reached what we believed was the summit, only to discover a further kilometer-long ridge leading to the true top. As night fell, we returned to the refuge, and the following day we descended this fortunately extinct volcano.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**

Our expedition to Carstensz aimed not only to establish a new route but also to spend significant time with the indigenous Dani people. The mountain, considered sacred by local tribes, is being damaged by the world's largest gold mine.
We had received warnings about potential hostage-taking or even murder by bandits, but, undeterred, we left our hut mid-morning and walked down winding paths into the jungle. On May 12th, we began our climb. The weather improved, and two team members raced ahead. We progressed more slowly because Sharu was filming. Wearing rock climbing shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am.
I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh and final summit. The mission was accomplished",,
238,"Three theories about sleep 

People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain, therefore, that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. 
There seem to be three main theories. The most popular states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. In other words, biological processes work hard as we sleep to repair any damage done during the day and to restore ourselves to full efficiency. However, a second theory places more emphasis on the learning benefits of sleep. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day, and asserts that, without sleep, learning would not take place. A third popular theory is based on ideas about energy, saying that we need periods of sleep in order to, in a sense, recharge our batteries and so have an adequate supply of energy for the coming day.

The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support

If you applied for a job in some countries, you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting, as much as anything else, that would determine your suitability for the job.
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting analysis is increasingly being used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions.
She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'
According to Ms Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.

The person behind the handwriting: examples analysed by graphologist Patricia Marne. 'I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.'

'Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.'
Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred.'
A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.
Ms Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form 'threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting - how far the writer has deviated from copybook script - indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.
Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronising attitude.
Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately, and this has to be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels that more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing.
This will happen soon, she believes. 'It's actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.'
Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance.",C1,,,"The pen is stronger than the mind doctor.

The study of handwriting to learn about a person's character is becoming more popular.

In some countries, if you want a job, you will probably be asked to write something by hand. Your handwriting could be the main reason you get the job or not.

Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Experts say it can help show some health problems, like heart disease and cancer. It can also show a person's feelings and mental state.

More and more, companies use handwriting analysis to help choose the right person for a job. Many large businesses now ask graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs.

But most doctors and mental health experts are not sure if graphology is useful. Patricia Marne has worked as a graphologist for over 20 years. She thinks experts should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show a person's personality and some health issues.

She says: ""Handwriting can tell us about a person's social class and how smart they are. It can also help us understand their mental ability, if they are better at arts or sciences, and if they are honest or like to hide things.""

According to Ms Marne, graphology is especially helpful in finding people who might commit crimes. ""Criminals often have messy, hard-to-read handwriting. Many come from poor families and have emotional problems. This can be seen in handwriting that looks very young or when people write over letters again and again.""

She adds, ""Young men who break the law often make some letters very tall. This shows they live in a dream world and hope to become rich and famous. Graphologists can see if a person might become violent, is under a lot of stress, or has serious mental problems. Handwriting can even help predict if someone might try to kill themselves.""

She also says that heart and lung problems can appear in handwriting. ""You cannot be sure from one writing sample, unless the writing is very shaky. But if over time the writing changes or becomes broken, or if the signature has a new break in it, it could mean something is very wrong.""

A big emotional problem can also change how a person signs their name for a short time.

Ms Marne says handwriting shows other parts of a person's character. People who write letters that connect in a thin line can be clever but not always honest. Those who write mostly in capital letters are hiding their true personality. Very light writing shows a sensitive person who may not have much energy. Original handwriting—different from how we learn in school—shows confidence and artistic skill. Writing where letters do not connect is a sign of someone who likes to be alone.

Very small signatures mean a person is shy and does not feel good about themselves. Drawing circles instead of dots over the letter 'i' means the person wants attention. Crossing the letter 't' with a heavy line over the whole word shows a person who is not patient and acts like they are better than others.

Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and practice to analyse handwriting well. You also need to understand people's feelings and use your intuition. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a true science.

She believes this will happen soon. ""It is actually more exact than psychoanalysis because you can learn a person's whole life story, including their emotional problems, without asking questions they might not answer truthfully.""

This all sounds interesting, but there is not much strong proof for these ideas. Some mental health experts strongly disagree. They say handwriting is just a result of education, artistic skill, and the style of writing you learned—nothing more.","The pen is more powerful than the psychoanalyst

The practice of studying handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular.

If you applied for a job in some countries, you would probably be asked to provide a handwriting sample. Your handwriting could be just as important as other factors in deciding if you are right for the job.

Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is considered a real science in many parts of the world. Experts say it can help identify certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer, and can show a person's mental state or emotional issues.

More and more, handwriting analysis is used for career advice and alongside job interviews. Many large companies now use graphologists to study the handwriting of people who want important positions.

However, most doctors and psychiatrists are still unsure about graphology's value. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show personality traits as well as some medical problems.

She says: ""Handwriting is a strong sign of a person's social background and intelligence. But it can also be used to judge mental ability and potential—for example, whether someone is better at arts or sciences, and if they are honest or secretive.""

According to Ms Marne, graphology can be especially helpful in spotting possible criminal behavior: ""Criminals often have messy, hard-to-read handwriting. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can appear in handwriting that looks very childish or where letters are written over multiple times.""

She adds: ""Young male criminals often have very tall letters, which suggests they live in a fantasy world and dream of great success. Graphologists can see if someone might become violent, is under extreme stress, or has dangerous personality traits. Handwriting can even help predict people who may try to end their life.""

She also says that heart and lung issues can sometimes be seen in handwriting. ""You can't diagnose an illness from one sample, unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if over time the writing changes or becomes broken, or if a person's signature develops a gap that wasn't there before, it could mean something serious has happened.""

A major emotional shock can also temporarily change a person's signature, she says.

Ms Marne explains that handwriting can show other personality features. People who write in a ""thread-like"" style, where letters are connected in a thin line, are often clever and not completely open. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true personality. Very light pressure when writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting—how much it differs from standard writing—shows confidence and artistic skill. Writing where letters are not connected is a key sign of someone who prefers to be alone.

Very small signatures can mean a person lacks confidence; using circles instead of dots over the letter ""i"" is a way of seeking attention, and drawing a heavy line across the letter ""t"" can show that a person is impatient and looks down on others.

Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and practice to analyse handwriting well, and this must be combined with understanding and intuition. She feels more research is needed to make graphology a proper science.

She believes this will happen soon. ""It is actually much more accurate than psychoanalysis, because you can learn a person's entire history, including their emotional difficulties, without asking questions they might answer incorrectly.""

240,"Hedgehogs 

A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world, none is native to either America or Australia. 
All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked, so that their spines point outwards. The effectiveness of this as a defence mechanism, depends, of course, on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. 
Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

The effectiveness of this strategy largely depends on the number of spines an individual hedgehog has. Certain desert hedgehogs have evolved to be lighter in weight, resulting in fewer spines. As a consequence, they are more likely to flee from danger and only resort to rolling into a ball as a final measure.

241,"The camera never lies 

Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, believed himself to be a rational man, a scientist even. But in 1920, when he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden setting, he thought he was seeing scientific proof that these tiny creatures really existed. He published the photographs alongside an article he wrote, acknowledging fairies as supernatural wonders. It was not until 1939 that the two ladies who took the photos admitted these were fake. They simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and arranged them among flowers. The results are undeniably beautiful. But the simplicity of the trick undermines a basic principle of photography, that the camera cannot lie.

Although digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture newsworthy events, it is social media that have revolutionised citizen photography.

Unfortunately, some reporters have published user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Despite official guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission if there are exceptional circumstances or strong public interest, debate continues about whether this is ethical. 
With research indicating that around one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, it is clear that UGC has a major role to play in the future of the media.

243,"Volunteer tourism 

Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. 
 
A.
It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. Whilst volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, they have usually paid a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work: money that, if donated to a local community directly, could potentially pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide. This is especially so in the case of gap years, in which the level of technical skill or professional experience required of volunteers is negligible. Hence, it is unsurprising that many academic studies allude to the moral issue of whether gap year volunteering is principally motivated by altruism - a desire to benefit the society visited - or whether young people aim to generate 'cultural capital' which benefits them in their careers. However, the projects may play a role in developing people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off. 

B.
Volunteering may lead to greater international understanding; enhanced ability to solve conflicts; widespread and democratic participation in global affairs through global civic society organisations; and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. In this scenario, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, an outcome where benefits accrue to volunteers and host communities, and contribute to the global greater good. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work. Those who volunteer will continue to reap its benefits, using host organisations and host communities as a rung on the ladder of personal advancement. 

C.
At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, volunteer tourism, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities. Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development. 
 
 
D.
Volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble 'making a difference', can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate. The personal element appears positive - it bypasses big government and eschews big business. Yet it also bypasses the democratic imperative of representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity, most often ones that seek to work around rather than transform the situations of poor, rural societies. Cynicism at the act of volunteering is certainly misplaced. The act of volunteer tourism may involve only simple, commendable charity. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development. The politics of volunteer tourism represents a retreat from a social understanding of global inequalities and the poverty lived by so many in the developing word. ",C1,,,"Volunteer tourism

Four writers talk about international volunteer work.

A.
It is not easy to say that volunteers really help a lot. They often build houses or schools, but they pay a lot of money to do this work. If that money went straight to the local community, it could pay for more workers than one volunteer. This is especially true for young people taking a year off, who usually do not have special skills. So, many studies ask if young people volunteer because they want to help others, or because it looks good on their CV. Still, these projects might help volunteers become better people who care about others in the future.

B.
Volunteering can help people understand other countries better. It can help them solve problems, join global groups, and make friends around the world. In this way, everyone benefits—both the volunteers and the communities they help. But if only rich people from wealthy countries can volunteer, they get the advantages, like a better career. The poor communities do not get the same chances. The volunteers may use the experience just to help themselves.

C.
Sometimes, international volunteering can be like a selfish holiday for rich Westerners. Other times, it is real help for development. At its best, it helps both the volunteer and the community. Volunteers can share skills and learn about other cultures. Most importantly, volunteering can make people aware of unfairness and poverty, and they may decide to fight it for their whole lives.

D.
Volunteer tourism seems like a good way to help others. It feels positive because it is personal—not through government or big companies. But it also avoids real government action and makes helping others just about small acts of charity. This does not change the real problems of poor societies. We should not think badly of volunteering itself—it can be a simple, good act. But when companies say volunteer tourism is real development, it weakens the meaning of development. Volunteer tourism can make us forget about the big reasons for world poverty.","Volunteer tourism

Four experts discuss the topic of international volunteer work.

A.
It is difficult to say that volunteers make a big direct difference to development. While volunteer tourists may help build houses or schools, they usually pay a lot of money for the experience. If this money was given directly to the local community, it could pay for more workers than one volunteer could ever be. This is especially true for gap year projects, where volunteers don't need special skills or experience. So, many studies question whether young people volunteer mainly to help others or to improve their own career opportunities. Still, these projects might help create people who will act in fair and caring ways throughout their lives.

B.
Volunteering can help people understand other countries better. It can improve skills in solving problems and encourage people to take part in global issues. It can also help create international friendships. In this way, the results are greater than just the work done – both volunteers and local communities benefit, and it helps the world. However, if only wealthy people from rich countries can volunteer, it mainly helps them. They gain international experience and improve their careers, but it does little for poorer communities who cannot take part in such programs. In this case, volunteers use the experience only for their own personal gain.

C.
In the worst cases, international volunteering can be a form of tourism where rich Westerners help others mainly to help themselves. It can seem like they are showing pity instead of respect. In the best cases, it is a real way to share skills and support development. Good volunteering brings benefits (and some costs) to both the volunteers and the communities. Most importantly, it can make people aware of global inequality and inspire them to work against poverty and unfairness for their whole lives.

D.
Volunteer tourism seems to match the modern idea of helping others in a personal way. This approach can seem positive, especially when people don't trust governments or big companies. It feels good to help directly. However, it also avoids the role of democratic government and treats development as a matter of individual charity. This often means helping poor communities without changing the reasons they are poor. We should not be cynical about volunteering itself – it can be a simple, good act. But when companies describe volunteer tourism as real development, it weakens the meaning of development. It shows that society is ignoring the real causes of global inequality and poverty.",,

Transition. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless, that is, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process - because, frankly, it may not be a process at all. 
But surely (you say) it is bound to happen eventually. Everybody knows that print newspaper sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Just look at the latest print circulation figures. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and many of the rest are down overall between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites go ever higher. 
All of which may well be true, depending on timing, demography, geography and more. After all, everyone - from web academics to print analysts - says so. Yet pause for a while and count a few little things that don't quite fit.
So if sales in that area have fallen so little, perhaps the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, though, the messages are oddly mixed. The latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. 
As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to find in the eye of the digital storm - they had a 5.4% increase to report. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many showed rapid growth. 
You can discover a similar phenomenon when it comes to books. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up massively this year. The apparent first step of transition couldn't be clearer. 
Yet, when booksellers examined the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. 
Tales like these of young people abandoning newspaper-reading are wildly exaggerated. Turn to the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 following the main national dailies. 
And even within Europe, different countries have different stories to tell. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany the decline has only been 7% all round - with a mere 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). 
Such varying national trends may well reflect a situation far more complicated than the prophets of digital revolution assume. America's media analysts used to argue that booming online advertising revenues would pay for change and, along with lower production costs, make online newspapers a natural success. But now, with digital advertisements on newspaper sites actually dropping back, such assumptions seem like history. 
Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way of attracting a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package. 
In other words, print is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates raise between nine and ten times more money than online. 
Of course this huge difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; adrift on the web, the job of just being noticed becomes far harder. ",C1,,"The end of printed newspapers may take a long time.

Change can be a good thing. But change can also be scary. The change for newspapers to go online is not easy.

You might think it will happen one day. We know fewer people buy printed newspapers. More people read news on websites. For example, sales of papers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian went down 8% to 10% this year. But their websites are more popular.

This might be true. But we should also look at other facts. A world report says newspaper sales around the world went up 1.1% last year. Sales went down in the West, but they went up in Asia.

News magazines are doing well too. Their sales went up 5.4%. In America and Europe, many magazines are growing.

Books are the same. E-readers like Kindle are popular. Sales are high. This looks like a big change.

But bookshops saw that sales of paper books went down only 0.4%. So people buy both paper books and e-books.

Some people say young people do not read newspapers. But this is not true. A study shows nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main newspapers.

Countries in Europe are different. In Britain, sales went down 10.8%. In Germany, sales went down 7%. In France, sales went down 3.1%.

This shows the story is not simple. People thought online ads would make a lot of money. But now, money from online ads on newspaper sites is going down.

Many American newspapers now ask people to pay to read online. The best way is to give people both the printed paper and online news together.

So the printed paper helps sell online news. Also, ads in the printed paper make nine to ten times more money than online ads.

This is a problem for newspaper companies. It is hard and costs a lot to have both a website and a printed paper. But people know newspaper names from the printed paper. On the internet, it is harder for people to find you.","The end of print may take some time

Transition is a nice word. It sounds calm. Change can be scary for some people and difficult for others. But transition means moving slowly and safely from now to the future. However, for newspapers moving online, it is not easy or comfortable. In fact, it might not really be happening at all.

You might think it has to happen one day. Everyone knows that fewer people are buying printed newspapers, while more people are visiting the same newspapers' websites. Just look at the latest numbers. Sales of The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and others have gone down by 8% to 10% in a year. But their websites are more popular than ever.

This may be true, but it depends on where and when you look. Many experts say so. But wait a moment and think about some facts that do not match this idea.

For example, if sales in one area have not fallen much, maybe the problem is only for some newspapers? But the information is confusing. A recent study by the World Association of Newspapers says that worldwide, newspaper sales actually went up by 1.1% last year. Sales went down in the West, but they went up a lot in Asia.

News magazines, which you might think are in trouble because of the internet, actually sold 5.4% more. In both America and Europe, some magazines did badly, but many grew quickly.

The same thing is happening with books. E-readers like the Kindle are selling very well. It seems like people are switching to digital books.

But when bookshops looked at how much money they made from paper books in the last six months, sales were only 0.4% lower. So it’s not paper or screen—it’s both.

People say that young people have stopped reading newspapers, but this is not really true. A recent survey shows that almost 5 million people between 15 and 35 still read the main national newspapers.

Even in Europe, every country is different. In Britain, sales have fallen by 10.8% in recent years. But in Germany, the drop is only 7%, and in France, only 3.1%.

These different numbers show that the real situation is more complicated than people think. In America, experts used to say that online advertising would pay for the change to digital. But now, online ads on newspaper sites are making less money, so that idea is wrong.

Many American newspapers now ask readers to pay for their online news. But the best way to get people to pay is to offer them both the printed newspaper and online access together.

This means that the printed newspaper is still important for selling online subscriptions. Also, printed ads make nine or ten times more money than online ads.

Of course, this big difference is a problem for newspaper companies. It is hard and expensive to run both a website and a printed newspaper. But newspapers are still well known in print. On the internet, it is much harder to get noticed.","The end of print may take some time

Transition. It’s a positive word and a calming idea. Change can worry some people and challenge others. But transition suggests moving smoothly from where we are now to where we will be in the future. However, when it comes to newspapers moving online, the process is uncertain and uncomfortable. In fact, it might not be a real process at all.

You might say it is certain to happen in the end. Everyone knows that sales of printed newspapers are falling fast, while visits to their websites are increasing. Just look at the latest sales numbers. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, and many others have lost between 8% and 10% of their readers in the last year, but their websites are more popular than ever.

You can see something similar with books. E-readers like the Kindle are becoming very popular, and sales have grown a lot this year. The first step of the transition seems clear.

But when booksellers checked the value of the physical books they sold in the last six months, they found it was only 0.4% lower. So, screen or paper? It wasn’t one or the other—it was both.

But in Germany, the overall drop is only 7%, and for quality papers it is just 0.8%. In France, the fall is only 3.1%, and for quality papers it is 0.8%.

These different national trends show that the real situation is much more complicated than digital experts believe. American media analysts used to say that growing online advertising money would pay for the change and, together with lower production costs, make online newspapers successful.

In other words, print is also an important tool for selling online subscriptions. And print advertising brings in nine to ten times more money than online ads.

Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself plus the inventor Tom Granger and the broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five currently available.
The 'dual alarm function' that is advertised with this model does not allow you, as I first supposed, to be woken by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends, but whose life is programmed to this extent?
Since this model costs more or less the same as the second model tested, the inclusion of a cassette player is quite a bargain - you can fall asleep to your own soothing tapes and wake up to a day without news. We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses and telephone. Anyway, I'm completely paranoid and always book a wake-up call in case the alarm doesn't go off.'
This model was voted best in the beauty stakes and overall winner. Paul Bridges declared himself 'in love with it', although the clock on the one he tested 'kept getting stuck at 16.00'. I was fascinated by the digital display, with its classy grey numbers on a gentle green background. The wide snooze bar means you can tap it on the edge with your eyes shut. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons, like pebbles on the beach, encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing when I finally looked at the SO-page instruction booklet.
The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out in order to use a hairdryer or the vacuum cleaner; this met with unanimous approval. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.
Tom Granger described this model with its extra built- in lamp as 'unbelievably tacky' in the way it's made. 'You have to wrench the funny light out of its socket to get it to work, which makes me wonder about the quality of the rest of it.' He complained that he had to read the instruction booklet twice before he could get it to work; the clock kept leaping from 12.00 to 02.00 so he had to go round again.
The light was certainly hard to position; you would never be able to read by it - it only shines on the clock, which is illuminated anyway. Paul Bridges said he was 'very tickled' by the lamp idea but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer is reminiscent of 'action stations' on a submarine and made me feel like hurling the whole thing across the bedroom. Interestingly, however, this model is the third most popular on the market.
Clearly aimed at young people, with its brightly coloured casing and matching bootlace strap, this one appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. 'I would choose this one because it doesn't disappear into the background like the others,' he said. In fact, the traditional design of the controls made it the only one we managed to set up without reading the instruction booklet. Too bad the alarm is allowed a hilarious 20- minute margin for error; the manual notes, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the pre-set time'. Paul Bridges scoffed at such a notion, adding that this model was 'terribly fiddly' and, indeed, 'completely useless'.
The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space', but also because it has old-fashioned dial tuning. 'It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning you're never really sure if you've pressed all the buttons in the right order so you can't have confidence that the thing will actually work.' He accepted, however, that manufacturers had been obliged to improve the quality of radios because of the advent of button-tuning. I thought the tuning rather crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model certainly works; it succeeded in getting me out of bed in just two beeps!

Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need something to help us wake up. That is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team tested five clock radios you can buy now.

The first clock radio has two alarms. But you cannot use the buzzer and then sleep a little more. You can set one alarm for work days and one for weekends. But who needs that?

This clock radio costs about the same as another one we tested. It also has a cassette player. This is a good thing because you can listen to music to sleep and wake up without news. The radio sounds very good. But it is too big. It is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""My clock radio must leave space on my table for my keys, wallet, glasses and phone. I also ask the hotel to call me in case the alarm does not work.""

This clock radio was the best looking and the winner. Paul Bridges loved it, but his clock stopped at 4:00. I liked the numbers on the screen. The big snooze button is easy to press when your eyes are closed. But the buttons felt nice, so I touched them like piano keys. This was a problem when I read the instructions.

This clock has a battery. So if someone pulls the plug, you do not need to set the time again. We all liked that. But it was difficult to set up. When we learned how, we felt clever.

Tom Granger said this clock radio with a light was badly made. ""You have to pull the light hard to make it work. This makes me worry about the quality."" He read the instructions two times to make it work. The clock jumped from 12:00 to 2:00, so he had to try again.

The light was hard to move. You cannot read with it because it only shines on the clock. Paul Bridges liked the light idea but said the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounds like a submarine and made me want to throw it. But this clock radio is very popular.

This clock radio has bright colors and a strap. It is for young people. Tom Granger and I liked it. He said, ""I choose this one because you can see it easily."" The buttons were easy to use. We did not need to read the instructions. But the alarm is not good. It can ring 10 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges said this idea was silly and the clock radio was not useful.

This clock radio is the easiest and cheapest. Tom Granger liked it because it is small and normal. It has an old dial to tune the radio. He said, ""It is easy to set up. With new buttons, you are not sure you press them in the right order."" But he agreed that button-tuning made radios better. Paul Bridges and I thought the tuning was simple, but the radio sounded fine. The buzzer works well. It woke me up with only two beeps!","Sound the Alarm

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us also need something to wake us up. That's why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our group, with me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models you can buy now.

This model says it has a 'dual alarm function'. I thought this meant you could wake up to a buzzer, then snooze, and finally get out of bed. But the instructions say you should use it to set two different times to wake up: one for work days and one for weekends. But who plans their life so carefully?

This model costs about the same as the second model we tested, but it also has a cassette player. This is a good extra. You can fall asleep listening to your own relaxing music and wake up without the news. We all thought the radio sound was excellent. We just wished it was smaller. It is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'Any clock radio I buy must leave space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. Also, I worry a lot, so I always ask the hotel to call me in the morning, just in case the alarm doesn't work.'

This model was the best-looking and the overall winner. Paul Bridges said he 'loved it', but the clock on the one he tested 'always stopped at 16:00'. I really liked the digital display, with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The big snooze button means you can press it easily with your eyes closed. Sadly, the smooth shape and buttons that feel like beach stones made me want to touch them like piano keys. This was a problem when I finally read the 50-page instruction book.

The clock has a battery backup. This means you don't have to set the time again if someone pulls the plug to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner. We all liked this. However, we all found it difficult to set up. But when we learned how, we felt clever and modern.

Tom Granger said this model, which has a small lamp, was 'very cheaply made'. 'You have to pull the strange light out of its place to make it work. This makes me worry about the quality of the rest of it.' He said he had to read the instructions twice before he could make it work. The clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00, so he had to start again.

The light was hard to put in the right place. You could never read by it. It only shines on the clock, which already has light. Paul Bridges thought the lamp idea was 'funny' but agreed the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounds like an alarm on a submarine and made me want to throw it across the room. But it is interesting that this is the third most popular model you can buy.

This one is clearly for young people. It has bright colours and a matching strap. It appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. Tom said, 'I would choose this one because it doesn't look boring like the others.' In fact, the controls were traditional, so it was the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. It's a shame the alarm is not very exact. The instructions say, 'the alarm may ring about 10 minutes before or after the time you set.' Paul Bridges laughed at this idea. He said this model was 'very annoying to use' and 'completely useless'.

This was the simplest and cheapest model we tested. Tom Granger liked it because it 'looked normal and didn't take much space'. He also liked it because it has an old-fashioned dial for tuning the radio. 'It's easier to understand how to set it up. With modern buttons, you are never sure if you pressed them in the correct order. So you can't be sure it will work.' He agreed, though, that radio quality had to get better because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit simple, and Paul Bridges agreed, but we thought the radio sound was fine. The buzzer on this model definitely works.

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and most of us rely on an external device to wake us up. This is where clock radios come in. But how do you select a good one? Our panel, consisting of myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently on the market.

The advertised 'dual alarm function' on this model does not, as I initially assumed, allow you to wake to the buzzer, snooze, and then finally get up. The instruction manual recommends using this feature to set two separate wake-up times, one for weekdays and another for weekends. However, who organizes their life so precisely?

Since this model is priced similarly to the second one we tested, the addition of a cassette player represents excellent value. You can fall asleep to your own relaxing tapes and wake up without the news. We all agreed the radio quality was outstanding, though we wished the unit itself were smaller. It is as large as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges commented, 'Any clock radio I purchase must leave sufficient space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and telephone. Furthermore, I am quite cautious and always request a hotel wake-up call in case the alarm fails.'

This model was chosen as the most attractive and the overall winner. Paul Bridges claimed he was 'in love with it,' despite the clock on his test unit 'consistently stopping at 4 p.m.' I was impressed by the digital display, with its elegant grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze bar is easy to locate and press even with your eyes closed. Unfortunately, the smooth, rounded buttons felt so pleasant that I couldn't resist running my fingers over them like piano keys. This became a problem when I eventually consulted the 50-page instruction booklet.

The clock includes a battery backup, so you don't have to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner. This feature received unanimous approval. However, we all found it technically challenging to program, though mastering it gave us a sense of accomplishment and sophistication.

Tom Granger described this model, which features an extra built-in lamp, as 'unbelievably cheap' in its construction. 'You have to force the odd-looking light out of its socket to operate it, which raises doubts about the overall quality.' He complained that he needed to read the instructions twice before he could make it function; the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 2:00, forcing him to start the process over.

The lamp was certainly difficult to position correctly; you could never read by its light—it only illuminates the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea 'very amusing' but agreed that the radio was difficult to tune accurately. The buzzer resembles an 'action stations' alarm on a submarine and made me feel like throwing the device across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third best-selling on the market.

Clearly targeting a younger audience with its brightly coloured case and matching strap, this model appealed to the inner child in both Tom Granger and myself. 'I would select this one because it stands out and doesn't blend into the background like the others,' he remarked. In fact, the conventional design of the controls made it the only model we managed to set up without referring to the manual. It is unfortunate that the alarm has a ridiculous 20-minute margin of error; the manual states, 'the alarm may sound approximately 10 minutes before or after the set time.' Paul Bridges dismissed this concept, adding that the model was 'extremely awkward to use' and, in his opinion, 'completely pointless.'

As the simplest and least expensive model tested, this one earned points with Tom Granger because it 'appeared very standard and occupied little space,' and also because it features old-fashioned dial tuning. 'It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never entirely sure you've pressed the buttons in the correct sequence, so you lack confidence that it will actually work.' He acknowledged, however, that manufacturers have been forced to improve radio quality due to the introduction of button-tuning. I considered the tuning mechanism rather basic, as did Paul Bridges, but we concurred that the radio quality was acceptable. The buzzer on this model is certainly effective; it managed to get me out of bed after just two beeps",,
246,"Margaret and her liquid assets
Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense'. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up.
Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business, using technology such as drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But when it comes to locating water, she needs nothing more than a forked hazel stick. The couple's success rate is higher than 90 per cent. Dowsing - the ability to locate water, minerals and lost objects underground - is a so-called 'sixth sense'. There are many theories about how it is done, ranging from the physical, such as magnetism, to the spiritual. One of the most credible is based on the knowledge that everything on this planet vibrates, water more than other matter. It is suggested that dowsers have an acute ability to sense vibrations while standing on the Earth's surface; some dowsers say that they can 'sense' water, others that they can smell it, smell being the most acute sense.
For the Wilkins, the drought years of recent times have been busy, with an almost six-week-long waiting list at one stage. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with wells that have dried up: 'We will see customers only once in a lifetime because wells last for a long time.' Other customers own remote cottages or barns, now holiday homes, where the expense of running water pipes for great distances is prohibitive. Others are golf-course developers with clubhouse facilities to build.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 metres down. 'You can't drill a well where there is the slightest risk of farm or other waste getting into the water supply. The water we locate is running in fissures of impervious rock and, as long as we bring the water straight up, it should give a good clean supply, though Cornwall is rich in minerals so you have to watch out for iron.'
Another necessity is electricity to drive the pump; this is too expensive to run across miles of fields so ideally the well should be near to existing power supplies.
After considering all this, Margaret can start to look for water. On large areas, such as golf courses, she begins with a map of the area and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and gently move it over the map. It will swing when it is suspended over an area where there is water.'
After the map has indicated likely areas, Margaret walks over the fields with a hazel stick, forked and equal in length and width each side. 'Once I'm above water I get a peculiar feeling; I reel slightly. When it subsides I use the stick to locate the exact spot where we should drill.' Gripping the two forks of the stick with both hands, she eases them outwards slightly to give tension. 'When water is immediately below, the straight part of the stick rises up. It's vital to drill exactly where the stick says. A fraction the wrong way, and you can miss the waterline altogether. My husband will dowse the same area as me; usually, not always, we agree on the precise place to drill. If we disagree, we won't drill and will keep looking until we do agree.'
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation, carrying out some curious old tradition down in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment' and that is the closest we can get to understanding why she locates water so accurately. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?
",C1,"Margaret finds water for people. She uses a special stick. The stick moves when there is water under the ground.

Margaret and her husband have a business. They make wells for water. Many farmers need their help. The farmers' wells are dry.

Margaret is very good at finding water. She is right more than 90 times in 100. She says she can feel the water. Some people say this is a special sense.

Because it is very dry, many people need Margaret. She is very busy. Farmers need new wells. People with holiday homes also need water.

Margaret looks for water deep in the ground. She makes sure the water is clean. She also needs to be near electricity for the pump.

First, she uses a map and a small weight on a string. The weight moves on the map to show where water is. Then, she walks on the land with her special stick. The stick points down when it is over water.

Her husband also looks for water. They usually find the same place to dig. If they do not agree, they keep looking.

Margaret has a special feeling for finding water. This helps her family's business. They find water for people every year.","Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground. She uses a forked stick from a hazel tree. Farmers ask for her help when their wells have no water.

Margaret and her husband have a business. They drill wells to find water. They use big machines. But to find where the water is, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are right more than 90% of the time. This skill is called dowsing. It is like a ""sixth sense"". Some people think dowsers can feel the water moving under the ground.

Because of dry weather, Margaret is very busy. Many farmers need new wells. Other people have holiday homes far from towns. It costs too much to bring water pipes to these places. Golf courses also need water for their buildings.

Margaret looks for water that is 50 to 70 meters deep. The water must be clean. She must be careful to avoid dirty water from farms. The clean water is inside hard rock. She also needs to be near electricity for the water pump.

First, Margaret uses a map and a pendulum. She moves the pendulum over the map. It moves when it is over water. Then she walks in the fields with her hazel stick. When she is over water, she feels strange. The stick moves. The straight part of the stick points up. This shows the exact place to drill. Her husband also uses a stick to check. They must agree on the spot before they drill.

Margaret is not the only person who can do this. It is an old skill. She calls it ""feeling the world around her"". This skill helps her family's business. They find water for people every year.","Margaret and her water-finding skill

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability. She can find water underground using a forked stick from a hazel tree. Farmers often ask for her help when their wells have no water.

Margaret and her husband have a business that digs wells. They use big machines to do this. But to find water, Margaret only needs her hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time. This skill is called dowsing. It is like a 'sixth sense'. People have different ideas about how it works. Some think it is about magnetism, others about energy. One good idea is that everything on Earth moves slightly, and water moves more than other things. People who dowse might be very good at feeling these small movements. Some say they can 'feel' water, others say they can smell it.

Because of dry weather in recent years, the Wilkins have been very busy. At one point, people had to wait almost six weeks for their help. Most customers are farmers with dry wells. Margaret says, ""We usually see a customer only once in their life because a good well lasts for many years."" Other customers have holiday homes in the countryside. It is too expensive to bring water pipes to these places. Some customers are building golf courses and need water for their buildings.

Margaret looks for water that is between 50 and 70 meters deep. She says, ""We must be careful not to drill near farm waste. The water we find moves through hard rock. If we bring it straight up, the water is clean. But in Cornwall, there are many minerals in the ground, so we must check for too much iron.""

They also need electricity for the water pump. It costs too much to bring electricity across big fields, so it is best to dig the well near existing power lines.

After thinking about all this, Margaret starts to look for water. For big areas like golf courses, she first uses a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map and it moves when there is water below.

Then she walks across the land with her hazel stick. The stick has two equal sides. She says, ""When I am above water, I feel a little strange and dizzy. When that feeling stops, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two ends of the stick and gently pulls them apart. When water is directly below, the middle of the stick points up. She says, ""It is very important to drill exactly where the stick shows. If you drill even a small distance away, you might miss the water. My husband also checks the area with his own stick. Usually we agree on the best place. If we don't agree, we keep looking until we find a spot we both think is right.""

Margaret is not the only person who can do this. It is an old tradition. Experts and writers are interested in this strange ability. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive feeling for the environment'. This is the best way to describe her skill. Without this 'sixth sense', how could her family's business be successful for so many years?","Margaret Wilkins is believed to have a special ability. She can hold a forked hazel stick above the ground and find water. More and more farmers are asking for her help when their wells become dry.

Margaret and her husband operate a well-drilling company. They use modern equipment like drilling machines and air-powered hammers. But to find water, she only needs a forked hazel stick. They are successful more than 90% of the time. This ability to find water or other things underground is sometimes called a 'sixth sense'. There are different ideas about how it works. Some think it is related to magnetism, while others believe it is more spiritual. One reasonable explanation is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. It is thought that people like Margaret are very good at sensing these vibrations from the surface. Some say they can 'feel' the water, and others say they can even smell it.

Because of recent dry periods, the Wilkins have been very busy. At one point, people had to wait almost six weeks for their services. Most of Margaret's clients are farmers with dry wells. She says, ""We usually only help a customer once because a well lasts for many years."" Other customers own countryside homes or old barns that are now used for holidays. For them, it is too expensive to install water pipes over long distances. Some clients are building golf courses and need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 metres underground. She explains, ""You must not drill where there is any risk of farm waste entering the water. The water we find flows through cracks in solid rock. If we bring it straight to the surface, it should be clean. However, Cornwall has a lot of minerals, so we must be careful about iron in the water.""

Another important point is that electricity is needed to power the water pump. Running power across large fields is too expensive, so it is best if the well is close to existing electricity supplies.

Once all these things are considered, Margaret can begin her search. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. ""I hold the pendulum still and move it slowly over the map. It starts to swing when it is over a place where there is water.""

After the map shows possible locations, Margaret walks across the land with her hazel stick. The stick is forked and both sides are the same length and width. ""When I am above water, I get a strange feeling and I feel a little unsteady. When that feeling stops, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two ends of the stick and gently pulls them outwards to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the main part of the stick lifts up. It is very important to drill exactly where the stick points. If you are even a little bit wrong, you can miss the water completely. My husband also checks the same area. Usually, but not always, we agree on the best place. If we don't agree, we don't drill. We keep searching until we both choose the same spot.""

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in using this unusual traditional method in the west of England. Experts and writers have long been interested in this hard-to-explain skill. Margaret describes it as an 'intuitive understanding of the environment'. That is the best way to explain how she finds water so successfully. If she didn't have this special ability, how could her family continue to earn a living from their well-drilling business year after year?",,
247,"I may be too old for this lark, but here goes!
At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He ponders what has made him -- and others of hi sage -- take the plunge.
This summer, I quit my job and resolved to rent out my flat and go travelling in South East Asia for a yeaL You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous.
It's not as if I haven't done the travelling thing before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned. was determined to do it again some day, But you know how it is ... I fell in love, embarked on a career, bought a Hat and got used to earning a salary. But I gradually realised I had been sacrificing my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in that letter of resignation, it felt as though I'd taken charge of my life again.
I now have no tics. Many of my friends are now married with children and, while they wouldn't swap places with me, they envy me my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no burning career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake!
Why am I so nervous? In the first place, 1t's a question of making the necessary arrangements. How could I bear to have someone else living in my home? And how would I go about organising the letting? And apart from anything else, I had to decide where to go.
T'm a shocking procrastinator. and am already several weeks behind my intended schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not hang around for the start of the football season?' Severing emotional ties makes it even more difficult.
I'm putting it off because, deep down, I wonder if I can still cope with backpacking. Will I be able to readjust to a more basic wav of life? Will I feel out of place among a community of backpackers fresh out of school and university?
Perhaps not. I've discovered it's increasingly common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to disentangle themselves from the lives they've made for themselves and head ofT for foreign climes.
Jennifer Cox, of Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, identifies a growing awareness that adventure is there for the raking: 'The penny's dropped. The sort of people who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity"" are realising that they can have it any time they want. They just have to be brave enough and organised enough and confident enough to do it.'
1-'0I' Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have a final fling before settling down. They have bought 'I round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm prepared to sacrifice job security to have the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a niggling thought at the back of your mind that. ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'm going to be in the same position I was in before when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take, When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a ceremonial act of defiance!'
For Matt, who'd just got out of the Army, the year he spent travelling amounted to a period of metamorphosis. 'When you're in the military, there's a set wav of doing things, a pattern to the way you approach problems. I went away because I really needed to temper this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, in order to have a reasonable existence as a civilian.'
While there are as many reasons to go travelling at my time of life as there are travellers, there do seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts and so if your contract's just come to an end you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.'
For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specialises in the tales of 'ordinary' travellers, an increasing number of thirty-somethings are taking stock of their lives. 'If you're nor happy doing what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer a question of just seeing it through. Now people are aware that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" any more. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to take a step back and think about your life.'
Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to come to terms with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks nor. 'It's a sign of a better educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paving the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?""
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading off to Central America for a year , does nor believe he's running away. 'It's more a case of running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself' But he does feel some trepidation. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day. saying ""hi"" to everyone and sitting down with a cup of coffee.'
I share Ben's reservations about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges and I'm nor sure I'd be making this journey if [ hadn't found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst. like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.'
It may have taken a helpful kick up the backside to get me moving, but I'm now approaching the next 12 months with a mounting sense of excitement. Whatever the outcome, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having grabbed life by the horns. And in that I'm sure I speak for all of us ageing backpackers.
",C1,,"I am 34 years old. I left my job to travel. I will rent my flat and go to South East Asia for one year. You might think I am lucky, but I feel nervous too.

I travelled before. After university, I travelled in North and South America for two years. I wanted to travel again one day. But then I fell in love. I started a job and bought a flat. I liked having money from work. But I felt I only worked for money. When I left my job, I felt free.

Now I have no job. Many of my friends are married and have children. They do not want my life, but they like that I have no big jobs to do. I am not with a partner. I do not have big work plans. I feel I should use this free time. Maybe for my friends too.

Why am I nervous? First, I must plan many things. How can another person live in my home? How do I do that? And I needed to pick a place to go.

I often wait too long. I am already late. ""I can enjoy summer here,"" I said. Then, ""Why not wait for football to start?"" It is hard to leave things.

I wait because I think: can I still travel with a backpack? Can I live a simple life? Will I feel different from young travellers who just left school?

Maybe not. I see more people around 30 years old want to leave their lives and travel.

Jennifer Cox works for a travel book company. She says more people know they can have adventures. People who say, ""I wish I could travel,"" now see they can. They must be brave and ready.

Danny is 30 and works with numbers. His girlfriend Tammy is 28 and teaches. For them, this is a last trip before a quiet life. They bought tickets to travel the world for one year. Danny says, ""I will leave my safe job to travel. I think when I come back, my work will be the same. But I must try. When I left my office, I threw my calculator in the river. It was my way to say goodbye to my old life.""

Matt left the army and travelled for a year. For him, it was a big change. ""In the army, you do things one way. I travelled to change how I think. I wanted to live a normal life.""

People travel at my age for many reasons. Angela Baron says, ""Now, people change jobs more. Many people work for short times. If your job finishes, you lose nothing."" Some big companies let workers take long breaks. ""If a company teaches someone, they want that person to return.""

Dan Hiscocks works for a company that writes about normal travellers. He says more people around 30 years old think about their lives. ""If you are not happy with your job, you can leave. People know there are other choices. A job is not for your whole life. Travel helps you think about your life.""

Is travel a way to not be an adult? Jennifer Cox says no. ""It means our society is better. People think less about money and more about a good life. We ask, 'Is this what I want?'""

Ben is 32 and works with pictures. He will go to Central America for one year. He says, ""I am not leaving my life. I am going to something new. I want things for myself."" But he is a little scared. ""I will miss my normal days — going to work, saying hello to people, and drinking coffee.""

Like Ben, I will miss my easy life. I am not sure I would travel if my boss was not difficult. Jennifer Cox says, ""This is normal. There is often a reason, like the end of a relationship or no job. Something makes people go.""

Something made me go, and now I feel happy about the next year. Whatever happens, I will be glad I tried something new. I think all older travellers like me feel this way.","I might be too old for this adventure, but I'm going to try!
Tim Pozzi is 34 years old. He has left a good job to travel with a backpack. He thinks about why he and other people his age are making this big change.

This summer, I left my job. I decided to rent my flat and travel in South East Asia for one year. You might think I am lucky, but I am 34, and I feel nervous.

I have travelled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to travel again one day. But then life happened: I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to having a salary. Slowly, I understood that I was giving up my own happiness for money. When I gave my boss my resignation letter, I felt like I was taking control of my life again.

Now I have no ties. Many of my friends are married with children. They would not change places with me, but they like that I have no big responsibilities. I am not in a relationship now, and I don't have strong career goals. I feel I should use this freedom – maybe for my friends too!

Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the plans. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organise the rental? And I also had to choose where to go.

I often put things off, and I am already weeks behind my plan. 'I should enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not stay for the start of the football season?' It is hard to leave things behind.

I am delaying because I worry if I can still manage backpacking. Can I live a simple life again? Will I feel different from younger backpackers who have just left school or university?

Maybe not. I found that it is now more common for British people in their late twenties and thirties to leave their normal lives and travel to other countries.

Jennifer Cox works for Lonely Planet guidebooks. She says more people now know that adventure is possible: 'People understand. Those who always say ""I wish I had that chance"" now see they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organised, and confident to do it.'

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this is a last adventure before they settle down. They bought a ticket to travel around the world for a year. 'I am ready to give up job security to take this trip,' says Danny. 'Sometimes I think, ""I won't move up in my career, I'll be in the same job when I return,"" but I think it's a risk I must take. When I left work, I threw my calculator in the river as a way to say I'm free!'

For Matt, who just left the army, travelling for a year was a big change. 'In the military, there is one way to do things. I travelled because I needed to change this way of thinking to live well as a normal person.'

People travel at my age for many reasons, but there are some common ones. 'Today, people change jobs more often,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Big companies even have rules for career breaks. 'If you train someone well, it's good to know they will come back instead of working for another company.'

Dan Hiscocks works for Travellerseye, a company that publishes stories by normal travellers. He says more people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. 'If you are not happy with your job – and many people aren't – you don't have to keep doing it. Now people know there are other chances, and a job is not forever. Travel lets you stop and think about your life.'

Is wanting to travel just because my generation can't be adults? Jennifer Cox doesn't think so. 'It shows we live in a better educated, more stable society. We care less about just paying bills and more about having a balanced life. We are taking time to ask, ""Is this what I want?""'

Ben is 32 and works with pictures. He is going to Central America for a year. He doesn't think he is running away. 'It's more like I am running towards something. I am trying to get things I want for myself.' But he also feels a little scared. 'I think about what I am leaving: my comfortable routine – just going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having a coffee.'

I feel the same as Ben about leaving a safe life with few problems. I'm not sure I would travel if I didn't find my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox says: 'This is normal. There is often a reason, like a break-up or losing a job. Something like that can push people to go.'

Maybe I needed a push to start, but now I feel more and more excited about the next 12 months. Whatever happens, I will be happy that I took a chance with my life. And I think all us older backpackers feel the same.","I might be too old for this kind of adventure, but I'm going to give it a try anyway!
At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He reflects on what has motivated him – and others his age – to take this step.

This summer, I resigned from my job and made the decision to rent out my flat and travel around Southeast Asia for a year. You might consider me fortunate, but at 34, I feel quite anxious.

It’s not as though I’ve never travelled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking across North and South America, and when I returned, I was determined to do it again someday. However, life took over – I fell in love, built a career, purchased a flat, and became accustomed to earning a salary. Gradually, I realised I had been sacrificing my personal satisfaction for my job. When I submitted my resignation letter, it felt like I was finally taking control of my life again.

Now I have no commitments. Many of my friends are married with children, and although they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my lack of responsibilities. I’m no longer in a relationship, and I don’t have strong career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to take full advantage of this freedom – if only for my friends’ sake!

So why am I so nervous? Firstly, there are numerous arrangements to be made. How will I cope with someone else living in my home? How do I go about organising the rental? Besides that, I had to decide where to travel.

I tend to procrastinate, and I’m already several weeks behind my original schedule. ""I might as well enjoy the summer in England,"" I told myself. Then, ""Why not stay for the beginning of the football season?"" Breaking emotional ties makes it even more challenging.

I’m delaying because, deep down, I question whether I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adapt to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers who have just finished school or university?

Perhaps not. I’ve discovered that it’s increasingly common for people in their late twenties and thirties to break away from their established lives and travel overseas.

Jennifer Cox, from Lonely Planet guidebooks, observes a growing awareness that adventure is accessible: ""People have realised that they can seize these opportunities whenever they choose. They simply need to be brave, organised, and confident enough to take action.""

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it’s a final adventure before settling down. They’ve purchased a round-the-world ticket for a year. ""I’m prepared to sacrifice job security to take this trip,"" says Danny. ""There’s always a nagging thought that I won’t have advanced in my career when I return, but I believe it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!""

For Matt, who had just left the army, a year of travelling represented a period of transformation. ""In the military, there’s a fixed way of doing things. I travelled because I needed to soften that approach in order to live a reasonable life as a civilian.""

While people travel at my age for various reasons, there appear to be common factors. ""Today’s workforce is much more flexible,"" says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. ""More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose."" Some larger companies are even introducing career-break policies. ""If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s reassuring to know they might return instead of joining a competitor.""

According to Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specialises in stories by ordinary travellers, a growing number of people in their thirties are reevaluating their lives. ""If you’re unhappy with your current situation – and many people are – it’s no longer about simply enduring it. People now recognise that opportunities exist and that jobs aren’t necessarily for life. Travel offers a chance to reassess your life and gain perspective.""

Is giving in to wanderlust just another indication that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. ""It’s a sign of a better educated, more stable society where people are less focused on paying bills and more interested in living a balanced life. We’re actually taking the time to ask ourselves, 'Is this what I really want?'""

Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher who is travelling to Central America for a year, doesn’t believe he’s running away. ""It’s more a case of running towards something. I’m trying to grasp the things I want for myself."" However, he does feel some apprehension. ""It’s the thought of leaving behind my comfortable routine – just the simple act of going to the office every day, greeting everyone, and sitting down with a coffee.""

I share Ben’s concerns about leaving a structured life with few challenges, and I’m not certain I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox notes, ""This is fairly typical. There’s often a catalyst, like the end of a relationship or losing a job. Such events can motivate people to take the leap.""

It might have required a push to get me started, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with increasing excitement. Whatever the result, I’ll be satisfied that I took charge of my life. And in that, I believe I speak for all of us older backpackers.",,

We invited four leading naturalists to tell us about the wildlife classic that has influenced them most.

Geoffrey Lean
At least it wasn't hard to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, one advantage of longevity is that I have had the chance to meet some of the giants who pioneered thinking in the field. Of these, none stood, indeed, still stands, taller than a small, frail woman, Barbara Ward. I can't think of anyone else more at the heart of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She has synthesised her experience of various environmental movements into her own compelling philosophy. Unwillingly 'volunteered' to cover the field, I found, as a young journalist, that she, more than anyone, made it all make sense.
Picking the book was much harder. It could have been Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But despite its title (which sounded old-fashioned, even in 1976), The Home of Man is, to me, Barbara's most important book. Its focus is on the explosive growth of the world's cities, but its canvas is the great themes to which she devoted her life. It is as eloquent and as impassioned a plea as exists for what we would now call 'sustainable human development'. In the hundreds of books I have read since, I have yet to meet its equal.

When I open the pages of Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the long calls of herring gulls, recall the smell of the guano in the hot sun and visualise the general hullabaloo of the colony. This book explains superbly, through words and pictures, the fascinating world of animal communication.
Read Signals for Survival and then watch any gull colony, and the frenzy of activity changes from apparent chaos to a highly efficient social structure. You can see which birds are partners, where the boundaries are and, later on in the season, whole families can be recognised.
A distinguished behaviourist, Niko Tinbergen came from that rare breed of academics who wish to explain their findings to the layperson. His collaboration in this book with one of this century's most talented wildlife artists, Eric Ennion, was inspirational and has produced a book of interest to anyone with a love of wildlife. His spontaneous style of painting came from years of watching and understanding birds. With just a minimal amount of line and colour, he brings to life how one gull is an aggressor, how another shows appeasement. This is the art of a true field naturalist.

Lee Durrell
Most definitely, My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that has had the greatest influence on my life. Beyond the obvious reason that it ultimately led me to a wonderful husband, and an exciting career in conservation, this extraordinary book once and for all defined my devotion to the natural world.
I was doing research work into animal vocalisations in Madagascar when I first read the book. I had been there two years and was discouraged by the number of setbacks I was encountering but when, at the end of the day, I opened My Family and Other Animals to where I had left off the night before, the world became a brighter place. Animals, people, joy and beauty inextricably woven together - a microcosm of a world worth saving.
Many people say that our species is the worst because of the terrible things we have done to the others. But I like to think back to Gerald as a boy in My Family and Other Animals, looking at the world's inhabitants as a whole, a family whose members, be they good, bad or indifferent, are nevertheless so intertwined as to be inseparable. And that is a concept we all need to grasp.

A copy of The Shell Bird Book, by James Fisher, found its way into my school library shortly after it was first published in 1966. I was drawn to it at once, especially to the 48 colour plates of birds by Eric Ennion, painted, as the jacket puts it, ... with particular skill and charm'. It was those Ennion images which captured my attention.
I already had copies of other bird books and had spent several holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to begin sketching what I saw as an aid to identification. But in The Shell Bird Book there was so much more to feast on. As well as the glorious Ennion paintings, there were chapters on migrants and migration, a review of the history of birds in Britain, and, best of all, a chapter on birds in music, literature and art.
It was the broad span of ornithological information and the exciting images that steered me towards being more of a generalist in my appreciation of birds and the natural world. The book made it clear that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid and as possible as a rational and scientific one. And, as art was a stronger subject for me than maths or physics, I began to see a door opening for me

Geoffrey Lean
It was easy to choose the writer. As a journalist who writes about the environment, I have lived a long time and met some of the great people who first had important ideas in this area. The most important person I met was a small, quiet woman named Barbara Ward. I believe no one else understood environmental problems in Europe after the war better than she did. She put her knowledge from different environmental groups into her own strong way of thinking. When I was a young journalist and had to write about this topic, her ideas helped me understand everything.

Choosing the book was more difficult. I could have chosen Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But for me, her most important book is The Home of Man. The book is mainly about the fast growth of cities around the world, but it also talks about the big ideas she cared about all her life. It is a very powerful and emotional argument for what we now call 'sustainable human development'. I have read hundreds of other books, but I have never found one as good as this.

When I open the book Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the sounds of herring gulls, remember the smell of bird waste in the hot sun, and see the busy activity of the bird group in my mind. This book uses words and pictures to explain the interesting world of how animals talk to each other.

If you read this book and then watch a group of gulls, you will understand their busy actions. It changes from looking like chaos to a very organised social group. You can see which birds are a pair, where their area is, and later you can recognise whole families.

Niko Tinbergen was a famous scientist who studied animal behaviour. He was the kind of expert who wanted normal people to understand his work. He worked with a great wildlife artist, Eric Ennion, on this book. Ennion's way of painting came from many years of watching and understanding birds. With only a few lines and a little colour, he can show one gull being aggressive and another being peaceful. This is the skill of a true nature expert.

For me, the book that changed my life the most is My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell. Of course, one reason is that it led me to meet my wonderful husband and start an exciting job protecting nature. But this amazing book also made me sure that I love the natural world.

I first read the book when I was in Madagascar, studying the sounds animals make. I had been there for two years and was feeling sad about all the problems I faced. But at the end of the day, when I opened My Family and Other Animals, the world felt happier. The book mixes animals, people, happiness, and beauty together. It shows a small version of a world that is worth protecting.

Many people say humans are the worst species because of the bad things we do to other animals. But I like to remember Gerald as a boy in his book. He saw all the world's living things as one big family. The members of this family might be good or bad, but they are all connected and cannot be separated. This is an idea we all need to understand.

A copy of The Shell Bird Book by James Fisher arrived in my school library soon after it was first printed in 1966. I liked it immediately, especially the 48 colour pictures of birds by Eric Ennion. The book cover said the pictures were painted 'with particular skill and charm'. It was these pictures that I loved the most.

I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning the names of different birds. Those books made me start drawing the birds I saw to help me remember them. But The Shell Bird Book had so much more to enjoy. As well as the beautiful paintings, it had parts about birds that travel long distances, the history of birds in Britain, and my favourite part - a chapter about birds in music, books, and art.

The wide range of bird information and the exciting pictures helped me become someone who enjoys birds and nature in a general way. The book showed me that it is just as good to have an emotional and creative reaction to nature as it is to have a scientific one. Because I was better at art than at maths or science, I started to see a new opportunity for my future.","**Natural Books**

Choosing the author was easy. As an environmental journalist, one benefit of my long career is that I have met some of the most important people in this area. Among them, one person stands out the most: a small, frail woman named Barbara Ward. I believe no one else was more central to environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her knowledge of different environmental movements into her own powerful way of thinking. When I was a young journalist and had to write about the environment, she was the person who helped me understand it all.

Choosing the book was much more difficult. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*. But for me, *The Home of Man* is Barbara's most important book, even if its title sounds old-fashioned. The book focuses on the rapid growth of cities around the world, but it also covers the major themes she cared about all her life. It is a powerful and emotional argument for what we now call 'sustainable human development'. I have read hundreds of other books, but I have never found one that is as good.

When I open *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls, remember the smell of their droppings in the hot sun, and picture the busy activity of the bird colony. This book explains the amazing world of animal communication very well, using both words and pictures.

If you read this book and then watch a gull colony, the busy activity changes from seeming chaos to a very organised social group. You can see which birds are partners, where their territory ends, and later, you can recognise whole families.

Niko Tinbergen was a famous behaviourist who belonged to a small group of experts who wanted to explain their discoveries to ordinary people. His work in this book with Eric Ennion, a very talented wildlife artist, was inspiring. The book will interest anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's natural painting style came from many years of watching and understanding birds. Using only a few lines and a little colour, he shows how one gull is being aggressive, while another is trying to be peaceful. This is the skill of a true field naturalist.

The modern, cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened.
You cannot miss it. At first it was only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland that was unmissable, stuck on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its huge, yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings, topped by a hulk of a hanging garden. Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece', 'stunning'), cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. This winter, now that the inside is almost ready for the opening, the exhibitions themselves look set for a similar fate.
Forget the does-it-tell-a-nation's-story, is-it-chronological debate. The answers are definitely yes; it is a many-splendoured dream-coat of stories, each hung about a precious historic object, and there is an outline timescale that helps visitors get their bearings but does not strait-jacket the displays. And no, it does not let its lovely national treasures - such as Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver- get swamped in national pride.
The real issue here. assuming that the collections are properly preserved. is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to come back. Dr David Clarke. the head of exhibitions, insists that a visit should be a pleasurable. visual experience, and that it is designed not for specialists but for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this liberalism. Clarke is a convincing purist when it comes to what is on show. Mock-ups and scenes from the past that rely heavily on imagination are out. For Clarke. they are tantamount to 'giving a complete statement of certainty about what the past was like. which '. he explains, 'would be wrong. The public deserves the truth.' The result is that, at this museum. what you see is what the experts know. But the question for today's visitor is whether the objects' stories can be told vividly enough merely with explanation panels. captions and multi-media interpretation and using barely 30 computers in total around the museum.
Less than three days before the opening, it is still difficult to be sure. Some impressions are clear. though. and it is not just the panoramic views of Edinburgh Castle that take your breath away. Step inside and what immediately hits you is the sequence of spaces. Galleries open one into another. different sizes, different shapes. all with pale walls that are wood- panelled to look like large blocks of stone and inset with deep display cases. Shafts of daylight stream through arrow-slit windows and cascade down from the roof lights. There is room to ponder and enjoy every item on display.
Thanks to the 12-member Junior board. set up three years ago with 9- to l2-year-olds drawn from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. What the group really wanted was to be able to ride through the displays. Dr Clarke admits. They lost that one, but won a dedicated children's hands-on centre in what should have been the temporary exhibition gallery. As a result. the Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor. is the only temporary exhibition. Due to change after three years, it is a hotchpotch of objects chosen by Scottish people and other personalities as the items that have had most impact on life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister's suggestion was an electric guitar. Others went for televisions. Thermos flasks and favourite toys. Although the idea is fun. somehow it feels like a lightweight solution that has floated up to the top of the building. not a proper attempt to address serious issues. It may seem less frothy when the computerised bank of personal reasons and recollections goes live next week.
Overall. Dr Clarke seems right when he suggests that 'objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else'. As for the modernist architecture: it works brilliantly from the inside and the top, but whether it is in the right location is another matter.
",C1,,"The Tartan Museum

The new buildings of Scotland's national museum look very modern. They are different from the old buildings in Edinburgh. But are the things inside interesting? Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened.

You can easily see the museum. It is on a street corner in Edinburgh. It has a big yellow tower and unusual buildings with a garden on top. Last winter, people had different opinions about the building. Some liked the modern design, others did not. Now the inside is ready, and people will also have different opinions about the exhibitions.

The museum tells Scotland's story through time. It uses many interesting objects to tell these stories. You can see important national treasures, like jewels that belonged to Mary Queen of Scots. The museum shows these things with pride but not too much.

The main question is: will people like the museum and want to come back? Dr David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He says a visit should be fun and easy to understand for everyone, not just experts. He believes in showing only real objects from the past, not things made to look old. He says the public should know the truth about history. The museum uses signs, labels, and computers to explain the objects. The question is if this is enough to tell the stories well.

Just before the opening, it is hard to know for sure. But some things are clear. The view of Edinburgh Castle from the museum is amazing. Inside, the rooms are different sizes and shapes. They connect to each other. The walls are light-colored and look like stone. Light comes in from the windows and the roof. There is space to look at and enjoy every object.

The museum also has a special area for children. A group of children helped plan it. They wanted to ride through the museum, but they got a hands-on center instead. Because of this, the top floor has the only temporary exhibition. It has different objects that Scottish people chose as important for life in Scotland. The Prime Minister chose an electric guitar. Others chose televisions and toys. The idea is fun, but it does not feel very serious. It might be better when the computers with people's stories are working.

Dr Clarke is probably right when he says objects show the past better than anything else. The modern building looks good from the inside and the top. But is it in the right place? That is another question.","The Tartan Museum

The new buildings of Scotland's national museum look very modern, like pieces of cheese, and are very different from the old buildings in Edinburgh. But are the things inside as interesting? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You can't miss it. At first, only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland was easy to see. It stands on a street corner in Edinburgh with a big yellow tower and unusual buildings that have a garden on the roof. Last winter, people had different opinions about the building. Some loved the modern design, some thought it was interesting, and some really didn't like it. This winter, with the inside almost ready, the exhibitions might get the same mixed reactions.

Don't worry about whether it tells Scotland's story in order. The answer is yes. It is full of many interesting stories, each connected to an important historical object. There is a timeline to help visitors understand, but you can look at the displays in any order. The museum also doesn't let its beautiful national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels, get lost in a story that is only about national pride.

The real question is whether people will find the museum fun enough to visit again. Dr David Clarke, who is in charge of exhibitions, says a visit should be a nice, visual experience. The museum is for everyone, not just experts. He is very clear about what should be shown. He does not like models or scenes that try to show the past, because we can't be sure they are completely true. He believes the public should see the truth. So, in this museum, you see what the experts know. The question is whether the stories of the objects can be told well enough using only information panels, labels, and a few computers around the building.

Just a few days before the opening, it was hard to know for sure. But some things were clear. The amazing view of Edinburgh Castle is not the only thing that surprises you. When you go inside, you notice the different rooms. The galleries lead into one another. They are different sizes and shapes, with light-coloured walls that look like stone and have deep display cases. Daylight comes in through narrow windows and from the roof. There is plenty of space to stop and look at everything.

Because of a group of children aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre for children. The children really wanted to ride through the displays, but they couldn't have that. Instead, they got a special hands-on centre for children. This means the only temporary exhibition is on the top floor. It will change after three years. It is a mix of objects chosen by Scottish people and famous people as things that changed life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister chose an electric guitar. Others chose televisions, flasks, and favourite toys. The idea is fun, but it feels a bit light and not very serious. It might seem better next week when the computer system with people's reasons for their choices is working.

Dr Clarke is probably right when he says that 'objects show us the past more clearly than anything else'. As for the modern building: it looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it is in the right place is a different question.","The Tartan Museum

The modern, wedge-shaped buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out against the historic city of Edinburgh. But would the things inside be as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to the public.

You can't miss it. At first, only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland was impossible to ignore. It stands on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large, yellow sandstone tower and buildings shaped like cheese wedges, topped with a large hanging garden. Last winter, people reacted to the building in different ways. Some modernist architects loved it, calling it a 'masterpiece', while others were more cautious or even disliked it. This winter, with the inside almost ready, the exhibitions are likely to get the same mix of reactions.

Forget the debate about whether it tells the nation's story in order. The answer is yes. It is a rich collection of stories, each connected to a valuable historical object. There is a general timeline to help visitors understand the order, but it doesn't limit the displays. And no, it does not let its beautiful national treasures – like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels – get lost in a show of national pride.

The real question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return, assuming the collections are well looked after. Dr David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, says a visit should be an enjoyable, visual experience. It is designed for people without special knowledge, not for experts. Despite this open approach, Clarke is strict about what is shown. Reconstructions of the past that depend a lot on imagination are not used. For Clarke, they are like saying we know exactly what the past was like, which, he explains, would be wrong. He believes the public deserves the truth. As a result, in this museum, what you see is what the experts know. But the question for today's visitor is whether the stories of the objects can be told well enough using only information panels, labels, and multimedia, with only about 30 computers in the whole museum.

With less than three days until the opening, it is still hard to be sure. However, some things are clear, and it's not just the amazing views of Edinburgh Castle that are impressive. When you go inside, you immediately notice the series of spaces. Galleries lead into one another. They are different sizes and shapes, all with light-coloured walls that look like large stone blocks and have deep display cases set into them. Daylight comes in through narrow windows and from the roof. There is space to stop and appreciate every item on display.

Thanks to a group of twelve children aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland, who were chosen three years ago, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. Dr Clarke admits that what the group really wanted was to be able to ride through the displays. They didn't get that, but they did get a special hands-on centre for children, which was placed in the area meant for temporary exhibitions. Because of this, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change after three years. It is a mix of objects chosen by Scottish people and famous personalities as the things that had the biggest effect on life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister chose an electric guitar. Others selected televisions, Thermos flasks, and favourite toys. Although the idea is fun, it somehow feels like a less serious exhibition that has ended up at the top of the building, rather than a real effort to deal with important topics. It might seem more substantial next week when the computer system with people's personal reasons and memories is turned on.

Overall, Dr Clarke seems correct when he says that 'objects show us the past more clearly than anything else'. As for the modern architecture: it works very well from the inside and the top, but whether it is in the right place is another question.",,
250,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas...

It is strange how many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Out of the blue, Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden, has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today.
His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers of the baroque and classical periods, but new works too. When you meet him, bright-eyed and good-looking, he seems even younger than his years, as fresh and open in his manner as the sound of the trumpet.
Recently in one of London's premier concert halls he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, something of a party-piece for him, while on television a whole feature was devoted to his work and development, filmed both here and in Sweden.
Born near Malmo, he owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight.
His father, unmusical but liking Louis Armstrong's playing, had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. Being a serious man, he didn't pick a toy trumpet, but took advice and bought a genuine grown-up instrument.
The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, whom she persuaded to give her son lessons.
Bo Nilsson was an up-and-coming musician, and at once spotted natural talent. Hardenberger consistently blesses his luck to have got such a teacher right from the start, one who was himself so obsessed with the trumpet and trumpet-playing that he would search out and contact players all over the world, and as a 'trumpet fanatic' was 'always looking for another mouthpiece'.
There the mature Hardenberger has to draw a line between himself and his teacher. 'The trumpet is so primitive an instrument,' he explains, 'that you can't build a trumpet that is acoustically perfect. Whatever you do, it will have imperfections. Besides, you can't find two mouthpieces exactly the same. To me it is a matter of getting to know the imperfections and making a relationship with them.'
From the very start Hardenberger seems to have had the gift of finding the right compromise, and making that relationship. Without any sense of boasting, he explains that even in his boyhood years the characteristic Hardenberger sound was already recognisable, 'the first thing I acquired'.
And unlike the great British contender among virtuoso trumpet-players, John Wallace, who developed originally from a brass-band background and then through working in orchestras, Hardenberger has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple.
From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, another player who bypassed the orchestra. The boy bought all his records, and idolised him.
His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career. It was then a question of where, at 15, he should be sent to study. America, Bo Nilsson's first choice, was thought to be too far away and too dangerous, which meant that he went instead at the age of 16 to study in Paris with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud confirmed his prejudice against going into an orchestra, saying that 'Playing in the orchestra is like digging in the garden.'
He was objective enough about himself to know that he played the trumpet better than others of his age, but it was only at the end of the first competition he entered, at the age of 17 during his first year in Paris, that he came to realise that in addition he had a particular gift of communicating.
Thibaud suggested that he should enter the competition just for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round only, but he won through to the second. Luckily he already knew most of the pieces in that round too, but on getting through to the final he was faced with a concerto that had already daunted him. He didn't win first prize that time, but he enjoyed the performance, realising that though he 'played like a pig', people did listen to him.
Quoted like that, Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. Thoughtfully he refuses to try and analyse what such a gift of communication might consist of, as 'You risk destroying it in trying to explain. The power of the music lies in the fact that it can always move people.'",C1,,"A trumpet is not just for Christmas.

Many musicians do not come from musical families. Hakan Hardenberger is one of them. He is the only son of parents who are not musical. They live in the countryside in the south of Sweden. Now, at 30 years old, he is a very special trumpet player in the world.

His music recordings help people find new songs. This includes old music and new music. When you meet him, he has bright eyes and is good-looking. He seems young for his age and is very friendly.

Not long ago, he played a famous trumpet song in a big London concert hall. He was also on television in a show about his life and work. The show was filmed in London and in Sweden.

He was born near a city called Malmo. He started playing music because of a Christmas present when he was eight years old.

His father does not play music but likes the musician Louis Armstrong. He decided to buy his son a real trumpet, not a toy one.

The boy loved the gift straight away. He played the trumpet all the time. His mother found the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. This man, Bo Nilsson, said yes to teaching her son.

Bo Nilsson was a good musician. He quickly saw that the boy was very good at playing. Hardenberger feels very lucky to have such a good teacher from the start. His teacher loved the trumpet very much and was always looking for new parts for it.

Hardenberger thinks about the trumpet in a different way from his teacher. He says the trumpet is a simple instrument and it is not perfect. You cannot make a perfect trumpet. He says the important thing is to learn about the small problems with the instrument and work with them.

From the start, Hardenberger was good at this. He says that even when he was a boy, people could hear his special sound. It was the first thing he learned.

He always thought of himself as a solo artist, not an orchestra player. When he was a boy, his hero was a French trumpet player named Maurice Andre, who also played alone. The boy bought all of his records.

His parents helped him. They let him practice a lot and they wanted him to be a musician. When he was 15, they had to decide where he should go to study. America was the first choice, but they thought it was too far away. So, when he was 16, he went to study in Paris with a teacher named Pierre Thibaud.

His teacher agreed that he should not play in an orchestra. He said playing in an orchestra is like digging in the garden.

Hardenberger knew he played the trumpet better than other people his age. But when he was 17, he went to his first music competition in Paris. It was then that he learned he had another special gift: he could make people feel things with his music.

His teacher told him to go to the competition to learn. Hardenberger only learned the music for the first part, but he did well and went to the next part. Luckily, he knew most of the music for that part too. In the final part, he had to play a difficult song. He did not win first prize, but he liked playing. He saw that even though he did not play his best, people listened to him.

Hardenberger is very honest about his work. This might sound proud, but it is not true. He thinks a lot about his music. He says he will not try to explain his gift for making people feel things with music. He thinks if you try to explain it, you might lose it. He believes music is strong because it can always make people feel something.","A trumpet is not just for Christmas...

It is interesting that many musicians, even famous ones, do not come from musical families. Hakan Hardenberger is a good example. He is the only son of parents who are not musical at all. They lived in the countryside in southern Sweden. Now, at 30 years old, he is one of the best trumpet players in the world.

His recordings help people discover new music. This includes old concertos that people had forgotten, as well as new pieces. When you meet him, he looks young, friendly, and full of energy, just like the sound of his trumpet.

Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a famous London concert hall. He plays this piece very often. Also, a TV programme was made about his life and work, with filming in both London and Sweden.

He was born near Malmo. His career started by chance with a Christmas present when he was eight. His father, who is not musical but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to buy his son a real trumpet, not a toy one.

The boy loved the gift immediately and played all the time. His mother found the second trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, and asked him to teach her son.

Bo Nilsson was a young musician and quickly saw that Hakan had a natural talent. Hakan feels very lucky to have had such a teacher from the beginning. His teacher loved the trumpet so much that he was always looking for new mouthpieces and contacting players around the world.

But Hakan has a different view from his teacher. He explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument and no trumpet is perfect. He thinks it is important to learn about the instrument's small problems and get used to them.

From the start, Hakan was good at finding the right balance. He says that even as a boy, he had his own special sound. This was the first thing he learned to do.

Unlike some other great players, like the British trumpeter John Wallace, who played in bands and orchestras, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist.

As a boy, his hero was the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also did not play in an orchestra. Hakan bought all his records and admired him greatly.

His parents supported him and let him practise as much as he wanted. They agreed that he could make the trumpet his career. When he was 15, they had to decide where he should study. America was the first choice, but they thought it was too far and too dangerous. So, at 16, he went to study in Paris with Pierre Thibaud.

Thibaud agreed with Hakan that playing in an orchestra was not for him. He said it was like digging in the garden.

Hakan knew he played better than other people his age. But it was during his first competition, when he was 17 and living in Paris, that he realised he had another special skill: he could communicate with the audience through his music.

His teacher suggested he enter the competition for the experience. Hakan only learned the music for the first part, but he did well and moved to the next round. Luckily, he already knew most of the music for that round too. In the final, he had to play a difficult concerto that he was afraid of. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed performing. He realised that even though he did not play his best, people still listened to him.

Hakan is very honest about his work. This might sound proud, but that is not true. He thinks carefully and says he does not want to analyse his gift for communication. He believes that if you try to explain it, you might lose it. The power of music, he says, is that it can always touch people.","A trumpet is not just for Christmas...

It's remarkable how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without any musical background. A perfect example is Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents with no musical interest from southern Sweden. Now, at the age of 30, he has established himself as one of the world's most exceptional trumpet players.

His recordings consistently introduce audiences to new repertoire. This includes concertos by long-forgotten composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as contemporary works. When you meet him, he appears younger than he is, with a fresh and open personality that matches the clear sound of his trumpet.

He recently performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, a familiar piece for him, in a major London concert hall. Meanwhile, a television documentary focused entirely on his career and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden.

Born near Malmo, his career began accidentally with a Christmas present at the age of eight. His father, who wasn't musical but admired Louis Armstrong, decided to buy his son a proper trumpet rather than a toy.

The present was an immediate success. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet player of the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, and persuaded him to give her son lessons.

Nilsson was a promising young musician who instantly recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger considers himself fortunate to have had such a dedicated teacher from the very beginning. Nilsson was so passionate about the trumpet that he constantly searched for new equipment and contacted players worldwide.

However, Hardenberger holds a different opinion from his teacher regarding the instrument. He explains that the trumpet is a fundamentally simple instrument that will always have slight imperfections. For him, the key is to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them.

From the start, Hardenberger demonstrated a natural ability to find the right balance. He notes that even as a child, his distinctive sound was already developing, which he describes as the first significant skill he acquired.

Unlike other leading players, such as the British trumpeter John Wallace who developed through orchestra work, Hardenberger has always considered himself purely a soloist. As a boy, his role model was the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who was also known as a soloist. Hardenberger collected all his records and greatly admired him.

His parents fully supported his ambition to pursue a career in music. When he turned 15, the question was where he should study. His teacher initially recommended America, but his parents considered it too distant and risky. Consequently, at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud, who confirmed his dislike for orchestra work, comparing it to ""digging in the garden.""

Hardenberger was aware that he played better than others his age, but he only discovered his particular gift for connecting with an audience during his first competition. He was 17 and living in Paris at the time. His teacher had suggested he enter for the experience. Hardenberger had only prepared the pieces for the initial round, but he progressed to the final. Although he didn't win first prize, he enjoyed the performance and realized that people were listening to him attentively, despite feeling he hadn't played his best.

Hardenberger's honest assessment of his abilities might sound confident, but it isn't meant arrogantly. He reflects carefully on his music and believes that attempting to explain the power of musical communication could destroy its magic. For him, the strength of music lies in its constant ability to move people emotionally.",,

Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is the author of three critically acclaimed plays. He is currently adapting his first play, Peaches, into a screenplay. 'It's low budget but we don't know how low,' he explains. 'It certainly won't be over PS30 million, but then it could be 30 quid.'
Although obviously gifted, the most extraordinary thing about Nick is that before he wrote Peaches he had never been to or read a play in his life, 'When I wrote the play, I never even imagined it would get put on,' he says. 'It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the logistical problems. I knew absolutely nothing then.'
He left school at 16, only to return a year later, After A-levels, he enrolled at the Young People's Theatre, 'I realised I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard rather than read because of the rhythm and rhyme,' he says, 'Suddenly I was surrounded by like-minded people. It was the first time I'd been in an educational environment and actually enjoyed myself. It was very stimulating.'

Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has come a long way in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a television comedy series, and has just finished a punishing tour around the country with comedy star Steve Coogan,
He's always worked hard, Even as far back as Bristol, he was honing his art in comedy clubs. 'It was very theoretical at university,' remembers Simon, 'It made me realise I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I'd always been more interested in comedy, People think that comedy is the hardest job in the world and it really isn't. If you've got the courage and you've got good material, it's a wonderful thing to make people laugh.'
He has performed with the comic am Funny Business, but his relationship with Steve Coogan that has proved the most fruitful. 'He saw my show and, as I was a huge fan of his, he could probably see me mimicking him,' admits Simon. 'It was comedy clubs. 'It was very theoretical at university.' remembers Simon, 'It made me realise I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I'd always been more interested in comedy. People think that comedy is the hardest job in the world and it really isn't. If you've got the courage and you've got good material, it's a wonderful thing to make people laugh.'

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, came to the public's attention when he disco-danced into their living rooms as the lead in the series The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star, The critical reaction was extremely positive and his subsequent rise has been meteoric. 'It's been a really good showcase for me,' he says with a smile, 'I'm now in a situation where I can pick and choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted.' It is an unusually comfortable position to be in, especially when you consider that he has only just graduated, But glance at Ciaran's early career, and it's obvious such recognition was always on the cards.
Encouraged by his mother, he went from playing lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years, 'Basically I was using acting as an excuse not to do homework,' laughs Ciaran. 'But I suddenly decided I wanted to make a go of it because I had a knack for it, and a passion for it.'
Now he is more or less sitting back and waiting for the plaudits to roll in - but ask him what he thinks of the fame game and he suddenly becomes pensive, 'When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and the interviews but you soon realise it's not what you're acting for. It's not about that, It's about getting respect for doing good work.'

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer in the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three- album deal with Domino Records, Neil and the other half of Matrix, Rick Brown, are already tipped to be huge when their single, Chimera, is released shortly, 'The record company's idea of good sales is very different to mine,' he says, 'They're talking smash hit, but I've no idea, For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy.'
Unlike so many new pop sensations, Neil has actually worked very hard for his success, He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music business ever since, 'It's funny how things happen,' he says, 'I'd been slogging away doing student gigs for eight years and I was starting to get a bit jaded, I was just about to give up when this happened.' By 'this' he means meeting Rick Brown, who already had contacts at Domino, and forming Matrix, It couldn't have happened at a better time, 'There were times when I was thoroughly depressed - and I've been in some atrocious bands, But hopefully it will all have been worth it.'

Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more prizes, awards and academic honours than anyone twice his age, He is already well known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving several readings a week for the past six years, Now his first novel, Hidden, will be published in March, 'It's a story of obsessive love. It was a very strong idea that I couldn't do as a poem.'
Stephen was a huge fan of creative writing at school, but became disenchanted with education later on, 'I decided not to go to university but it wasn't until I became very bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre that I decided I should.' After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992, 'I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer - they always thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child.' With his poetry receiving such critical acclaim, his move into novels is indeed brave. 'There's a framework with my poetry and less scope for me to do something hideously wrong,' he explains. 'Because a novel can be any length of words, there are more words that could be bad words. My main ambition is not to get into a pattern where I'm just churning stuff out without worrying about the quality.'

Simon always worked hard. At university, he went to comedy clubs. He says, ""University was about ideas. I learned I did not want to be a serious actor. I like comedy more. People think comedy is very hard. It is not. If you are brave and have good jokes, it is good to make people laugh.""

Now he waits for people to say good things about his work. But when we talk about fame, he thinks. He says, ""When you are 18, you want photos and interviews. But then you see that is not why you act. You act to do good work. You want people to like your work.""

Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three plays that received excellent reviews from critics. He is currently adapting his first play, Peaches, into a film script. 'It's low budget, though we're not sure exactly how much it will cost,' he explains. 'It certainly won't exceed £30 million, but it might be as little as 30 pounds.'

Although clearly talented, the most remarkable thing about Nick is that before writing Peaches, he had never attended a play or read one. 'When I wrote the play, I never imagined it would actually be performed,' he admits. 'The entire play is set in a car. I probably wouldn't write it that way now because I understand the practical challenges. At that time, I knew absolutely nothing about theatre.'

He left school at 16, only to return a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. 'I realized I wanted to write for actors,' he says. 'I wanted my writing to be performed rather than just read, because of its rhythm and sound. Suddenly I was surrounded by people who shared my interests. It was the first educational environment where I actually enjoyed myself. It was incredibly stimulating.'

B
Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has advanced significantly in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a television comedy series and has just completed an exhausting nationwide tour with comedy star Steve Coogan.

He has always been dedicated to his work. Even during his university years, he was developing his skills in comedy clubs. 'University was very theoretical,' Simon recalls. 'It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor and that I'd always been more drawn to comedy. People believe comedy is the most difficult profession, but that's not true. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is incredibly rewarding.'

He performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been particularly successful. 'He saw my performance, and since I was a huge admirer of his work, he probably noticed me imitating his style,' Simon confesses.

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, first caught public attention when he danced into viewers' homes as the lead in the series The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. The critical response was extremely positive, and his subsequent rise to fame was rapid. 'It's been an excellent showcase for my abilities,' he remarks with a smile. 'I'm now in a position where I can select the projects I want to do, which is exactly what I've always wanted.' This is an unusually advantageous situation, especially considering he has only recently graduated. However, examining Ciaran's early career makes it evident that this recognition was always likely to happen.

Encouraged by his mother, he progressed from lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he remained for four years. 'Basically, I used acting as an excuse to avoid homework,' Ciaran laughs. 'But I suddenly decided I wanted to pursue it seriously because I had both a natural talent and a genuine passion for it.'

Now he's essentially waiting for the praise to continue - but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. 'When you're 18, you imagine you'll love the photo shoots and interviews, but you quickly realize that's not why you act. It's not about that. It's about earning respect for producing quality work.'

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album contract with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are already predicted to achieve major success when their single, Chimera, is released shortly. 'The record company's definition of good sales is very different from mine,' he comments. 'They're talking about a smash hit, but I have no expectations. For me, if even two people buy it, I'll be satisfied.'

Unlike many new pop sensations, Neil has worked extremely hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been attempting to break into the music industry ever since. 'It's interesting how things develop,' he reflects. 'I'd been working constantly at student gigs for eight years and was beginning to feel somewhat exhausted. I was about to give up when this opportunity arose.' By 'this' he means meeting Rick Brown, who already had connections at Domino, and forming Matrix. The timing couldn't have been better. 'There were periods when I felt completely depressed - and I've been involved with some awful bands. But hopefully all the struggle will prove to have been worthwhile.'

E
Poet and author Stephen Richards, 27, has won more prizes, awards and academic honors than many people twice his age. He is already well established in poetry circles, having toured and given multiple readings weekly for the past six years. Now his first novel, Hidden, will be published in March. 'It's a story about obsessive love. The concept was too powerful to express through poetry alone.'

Stephen was passionate about creative writing in school but became disillusioned with formal education later. 'I initially decided against university, but it wasn't until I grew thoroughly bored with office work at a theatre that I reconsidered.' After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. 'I don't believe my parents expected me to become a writer - they always assumed I'd remain a reader because that was primarily what I did as a child.' Given the critical acclaim his poetry has received, his transition to novels is particularly bold. 'My poetry follows a specific structure, which reduces the risk of major errors,' he explains. 'Since a novel can be any length, there are more opportunities for poor writing. My primary objective is to avoid falling into a pattern where I produce work rapidly without considering its quality.'",,
252,"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success
Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession
A
The rules for work are changing, We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yardstick is increasingly used in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be passed over and who will not. The new rules can he used to indicate who is likely to become a star performer and who is more prone to mediocrity. And, no matter what field we work in currently, they measure the trait- that are crucial to our marketability for future jobs, These rules have little to do with what we were told at school was important. The ability to do well in examinations is largely irrelevant to this standard. The new measure takes it for granted that we all have enough intellectual ability and technical knowhow to do our jobs. It focuses instead on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness - the 'people skills' that make up what is now commonly referred to as emotional intelligence.
B
In a time when few guarantees of job security have led to the very concept of a 'job' being rapidly replaced by 'portable skills', personal qualities begin to play an important role in the workplace. Talked about loosely for decades under a variety of names, from 'character' and 'personality' to 'soft skills', there is, at last, a more precise understanding of these human talents as well as a new name tor them. 'Emotional intelligence' is generally defined as the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. In our work-life it comprises basic elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships. There is a common assumption that it simply means 'being nice', However, at strategic moments it may demand not 'being nice', but rather, for example, bluntly confronting someone with the uncomfortable truth. Nor does emotional intelligence mean giving free rein to feelings - 'letting it all hang out'. Rather, it means managing feeling so that they are expressed appropriately and effectively, enabling people to work together smoothly towards their common goal.
C
More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a viral component of management philosophy. And the less straightforward the job, the more emotional intelligence matters - if only because a deficiency in these abilities can hinder the use of whatever technical expertise or intellect a person may have. There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, this crucial set of emotional competencies is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world.
D
Whereas one's IQ undergoes few changes, emotional intelligence continues to develop as we go through life and learn from our experiences: our competence in it can keep growing. In fact, studies that have measured people's emotional intelligence through the years show that most people grow more adept at handling their own emotions and impulses, at motivating themselves and at honing their empathy and social adroitness. There is an old-fashioned word for this growth in emotional intelligence: maturity. Not only can emotional intelligence be learnt, but individually we can add these skills to our tool kit for survival. This is especially relevant at a time when it seems a contradiction to put the words 'job' and 'stability' together. Emotional intelligence is no magic formula for uncompetitive organisations, no guarantee of more market share or a healthier bottom line. But if the human ingredient is ignored, then nothing else works as well as it might.",C1,,"**A**
Work rules are changing. Now, people look at you in a new way. It is not just about how smart you are. It is about how you work with other people. Companies use this new way to choose who gets a job. It shows who will be a very good worker. These new rules are not the same as what we learned in school. Being good at tests is not important now. The new way thinks we are all smart enough for our jobs. It looks at our people skills. These skills are things like starting new work, knowing how others feel, changing when you need to, and talking so people listen. These skills are called 'emotional intelligence'.

**B**
Today, people often change jobs. Your own skills are now very important for work. People have talked about these skills for many years. They used names like 'character'. Now we have a new name: 'emotional intelligence'. It means you can know your own feelings and other people's feelings. You can control these feelings. You can use feelings to help you think and act. At work, this means five things: knowing yourself, controlling yourself, wanting to do well, understanding others, and being good with people. It does not just mean being nice. Sometimes you need to tell someone a hard truth. It also does not mean you show all your feelings. It means you show your feelings in the right way. This helps people work together.

**C**
More companies now think emotional intelligence is important. For difficult jobs, these skills matter more. If you do not have these skills, it is hard to use what you know. Some people get a top job without good emotional intelligence. But when work is hard and people work together, companies with good teamwork do better. Today, teamwork and helping customers are very important. So, emotional intelligence is needed to do a good job in every country.

**D**
Your IQ does not change much. But your emotional intelligence can grow all your life. You learn from your life. Studies show that most people get better at handling their feelings. They get better at making themselves work hard and at understanding others. An old word for this is 'maturity'. You can learn emotional intelligence. You can add these skills to the things that help you in life. This is important because jobs can change. Emotional intelligence is not a magic way to make a company better. It does not mean a company will make more money. But if we forget about people's feelings, then other things will not work well.","**Emotional Intelligence – The Key to Success**  
Daniel Goleman looks at the 'people skills' you need to be successful in your job.

**A**  
The way we work is changing. People now judge us in a new way. It is not only about how smart we are or how much we know. It is also about how we behave with others and ourselves. This new way of thinking is important when companies choose who to hire or promote. It helps them find people who will do very well at work. These new rules are not the same as what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not so important here. This new idea says that we all have enough knowledge to do our jobs. Instead, it looks at personal skills like being able to start things on your own, understanding others, changing when needed, and being able to persuade people. These are the 'people skills' that we call emotional intelligence.

**B**  
Today, having a job for life is not common. So, your personal qualities are becoming more important at work. People have talked about these skills for many years using different names like 'character' or 'soft skills'. Now we have a better word for them: 'emotional intelligence'. It means being able to notice and control your own feelings and the feelings of others. It also means using those feelings to help you think and act. At work, this includes knowing yourself, controlling your emotions, being motivated, understanding others, and being good with people. Some think it just means being kind. But sometimes, you need to be honest, not just nice. Emotional intelligence does not mean showing all your feelings whenever you want. It means showing them in the right way so that people can work well together.

**C**  
More companies understand that emotional intelligence is a key part of good management. The more difficult the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If you don't have these skills, it can be hard to use your knowledge or intelligence well. Some people do well at work even without strong emotional skills. But now, jobs are more about working in teams and helping customers. Companies where people work well together have a better chance to succeed. So, emotional skills are becoming very important for every job everywhere.

**D**  
Your IQ does not change much, but your emotional intelligence can grow throughout your life. As we live and learn, we get better at managing our feelings, staying motivated, and understanding others. There is an old word for this: maturity. You can learn emotional intelligence. You can add these skills to what you already know. This is especially useful today when jobs are not always secure. Emotional intelligence will not solve all problems for a company. It will not always mean more money or success. But if we forget about people’s feelings and skills, nothing else will work as well as it should.","Emotional Intelligence – The Key to Success
Daniel Goleman looks at the 'people skills' that are necessary to reach the top of your career.

A
The rules for work are changing. We are now being judged by a new standard. It is not just about how intelligent we are, or our qualifications and knowledge, but also about how we manage ourselves and work with others. This standard is now often used to decide who gets a job and who does not, who is promoted and who is not. The new rules can show who is likely to be a top performer and who is more likely to be average. No matter what job we do now, these rules measure the qualities that are important for our future employment. These rules have almost nothing to do with what we were taught was important in school. Being good at exams is not very important for this new standard. The new measure assumes that we all have enough intelligence and technical skill to do our jobs. Instead, it focuses on social abilities and personal qualities, such as taking the first step and understanding others, being flexible and good at persuading people – the 'people skills' that together are now usually called emotional intelligence.

B
Because few jobs are secure for life, the idea of a 'job' is quickly being replaced by 'skills you can take with you'. As a result, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. People have talked about these qualities for many years using different names, from 'character' and 'personality' to 'soft skills'. Now, we finally have a clearer understanding of these human abilities and a new name for them. 'Emotional intelligence' is usually described as the ability to recognise and control your own feelings and the feelings of others, and to use feelings to help you think and act. At work, it includes key parts: knowing yourself, self-control, motivation, empathy and skill in relationships. Some people think it just means 'being nice'. However, sometimes it might require not being nice, but instead, for example, telling someone a difficult truth directly. Emotional intelligence also does not mean letting all your feelings out without control. It means handling feelings so that you express them in a suitable and effective way, helping people to work together well to reach their shared goals.

C
More and more companies are realising that supporting emotional intelligence skills is a very important part of their management approach. The more complicated the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. This is mainly because if you lack these skills, it can stop you from using your technical knowledge or intelligence effectively. Of course, there are people who have become very successful even though their emotional intelligence is not strong. But as jobs get more complex and require more teamwork, companies where people cooperate well have a real advantage. In the modern workplace, which focuses on teamwork and good customer service, these emotional abilities are becoming more and more necessary for success in every role and in every country.

D
While a person's IQ hardly changes, emotional intelligence keeps developing throughout our lives as we learn from experience. Our skill in this area can continue to improve. In fact, research that has measured people's emotional intelligence over time shows that most people get better at managing their own emotions and impulses, at motivating themselves, and at improving their understanding of others and their social skills. There is an old word for this development in emotional intelligence: maturity. Not only can you learn emotional intelligence, but you can also add these skills to your own set of tools for getting by in life. This is especially important now, when the words 'job' and 'stability' rarely go together. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution that will save uncompetitive companies, and it does not promise a bigger market share or higher profits. But if the human element is forgotten, then nothing else will work as well as it could.",,
253,"The Cabinet-Maker
Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him
Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop, tucked under a railway arch in East London, and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well, fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. But a glance around the workshop reveals that Hurst is obviously busy, with good reason not to waste a minute of his time.
The arched space is full of half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in an amazing array of natural colours. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built up a very nice reputation for himself. His order book is always full for several months in advance, despite the fact that he does not really promote himself. Word has spread that if you want a decent cupboard or table, bookcase or kitchen units, Hurst is your man.
Of course, finding a furniture-maker is not that taxing a task. Wherever you live in the countryside, the craft is alive and well. But finding a cabinet- maker who prides himself on making beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines is less easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says wearily. As a craftsman who sets himself exacting standards, he is continually disappointed by some contemporary furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He rails against shoddy, mass-produced furniture, and craftsmen who churn out second-rate pieces.
Such a quest for perfection is obviously a key to Hurst's success. That and his talent. This man is not coy about his ability. Indeed, his blatant self- confidence is as surprising as his initial brusque manner. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says, with a deadpan expression. 'I have always been good at making things.' If it were not for the self-deprecating mood into which he slipped towards the end of our interview, I would have believed his conceit to be wholly genuine.
Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says nonchalantly. Almost all of his commissions come from private individuals ('l used to do some commercial work for companies but it was soul-destroying'). Some clients have returned time and again. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he is honest enough to admit that relationships with clients do not always run smoothly. 'The most infuriating clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favourite clients are the exacting ones.'
If Hurst has every reason to be pleased with himself, he is also gracious in his praise for others - where it is due. With a sudden shot of modesty, he says: 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (the leading college of furniture design). However, he is also unremittingly critical of those craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also has little time for degree shows, in which students exhibit their work but at the same time are 'trying to make fashion statements. That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.'
Confident Hurst may be, even brusque, but you could never call him or his work pretentious. Indeed, his parting shot displays a welcome down- to-earth approach to his craft and a streak of humility strangely at odds with his earlier self- confidence. 'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says as I make my exit.",C1,,"The Cabinet-Maker  
Charles Hurst makes furniture. Joanna Watt meets him.

Charles Hurst looks like a very busy man. I visit his workshop under a train bridge in East London. He shakes my hand fast and says, ""Ask your questions now!"" Maybe he is shy, or maybe he is always like this. His workshop is full of work, so he does not want to lose time.

The workshop has many pieces of unfinished furniture and wood in different colours. Hurst has made furniture for ten years. Many people know he makes good furniture. He does not tell people about his work, but his customers tell their friends. If you want a good table, cupboard, or bookshelf, ask Hurst.

It is easy to find a person who makes furniture. But it is not easy to find someone who makes simple, beautiful furniture. ""There are not many real cabinet-makers now,"" Hurst says. He does not like a lot of new furniture. He does not like cheap furniture from factories.

Hurst wants his work to be perfect. That is why people like his furniture. He is also very good at making things. He says, ""I am good at making things. I always have been."" Later, he said he is not the best, so maybe he is not always so sure.

Hurst learned by himself. How? ""I asked questions and I learned,"" he says. Most people ask him to make things for their homes. He does not make things for companies now. Some people ask him to make furniture again and again. ""You make things for their whole house. That feels good,"" he says. But some customers are difficult. ""The worst customers do not know what they want. I like customers who know what they want.""

Hurst is happy with his work, but he says other people make good furniture too. ""Some people are better than me. I like their work,"" he says. But he does not like furniture-makers who take one year to make one thing. He also does not like student shows where furniture is more about fashion. ""Furniture must be useful, not just look new,"" he says.

Hurst is sure of himself and sometimes seems unfriendly, but he is not pretentious. At the end, he is more humble. ""I only make furniture,"" he says when I go.","The Cabinet-Maker

The workshop is full of half-finished furniture and pieces of wood in many natural colours. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and is well-known for his work. He always has orders for many months ahead, even though he does not advertise. People say that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen, Hurst is the right person.

Of course, it is not hard to find someone who makes furniture. In the countryside, there are many people who do this. But it is more difficult to find a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful, simple furniture. ""There are not many real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,"" Hurst says, sounding tired. He works to very high standards, and he is often disappointed with modern furniture. ""I am surprised by what some furniture-makers do, and sad that people accept it."" He does not like cheap, factory-made furniture or craftsmen who make low-quality things.

This wish to be perfect is one reason for Hurst's success. Another reason is his skill. He is not shy about his ability. In fact, his confidence is as surprising as his unfriendly manner at the start. ""I have a lot of natural ability,"" he says, without smiling. ""I have always been good at making things."" But later in our talk, he became more modest, so I did not think he was really proud.

Hurst taught himself. So how did he learn? ""I asked the right questions and learned everything,"" he says, without seeming to care. Most of his work comes from private customers. (""I used to work for companies, but I did not enjoy it."") Some customers come back again and again. ""You end up making furniture for their whole house. That feels very good."" But he is honest and says that working with customers is not always easy. ""The worst customers are those who do not know what they want and decide too late. My favourite customers are the ones who know exactly what they want.""

Hurst is happy with his work, but he also praises other people when they deserve it. Suddenly, he becomes modest and says, ""There are people much better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I did not study at Parnham"" (a famous college for furniture design). But he is also very critical of craftsmen who ""try to be artists and take a year to make one piece."" He does not like student shows where they ""try to make fashion statements. That can be silly. Furniture should not be a statement. It should be something people can really use.""

254,"Dorothy who?
The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is little known
For the past four years, I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on, I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. If their eyes light up, and they say things like 'Surely there's one already!' they have passed.
Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel prize ought to be enough. Anyone who held the same distinction in literature would be a household name. But Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was a remarkable individual by any standards, as many-faceted as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects some of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century: among them, the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.
When I began my research, I set out to read some scientific biographies. One of Hodgkin's friends recommended a new biography of Linus Pauling. Pauling was a close friend and contemporary of Hodgkin, worked in the same branch of science and shared a commitment to campaigning against nuclear weapons. I hurried to the main bookshop in the university town where I live, only to discover that not a single biography of Pauling was on the shelves. I now realise I was naive to be surprised that Pauling was not deemed sufficiently interesting to British readers, even though he was the most influential chemist of the 20th century and a winner of Nobel prizes for both chemistry and peace.
Even scientists themselves have doubted the value of the scientific biography. 'The lives of scientists, considered as Lives, almost always make dull reading', wrote the late Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, who laid most of the scientific groundwork that now makes organ transplants possible.
If scientists propagate this negative view, it is hardly surprising if publishers and booksellers share it. Treating scientists differently from everybody else as biographical subjects is one of the outstanding symptoms of the 'two cultures' mentality, the belief that there is an unbridgeable divide of understanding between the arts and sciences, still prevalent in the literary world. Few but the towering giants of science make it into the biography sections of bookshops.
Of course it is nonsense to say scientists, as a group, lead less interesting lives than artists and writers, or actors, or politicians. For some, the fastidiousness involved in maintaining scientific credibility extends to any kind of media appearance. A leading geneticist once told me he was happy to be interviewed about his work, but did not want to be quoted directly or photographed, because he did not want to be perceived as 'self-promoting'.
The avoidance of the personal conveys a false impression of the enterprise of science that discourages young people from joining in, and fosters more public suspicion than it dispels.
Fortunately, gaps are appearing in the smokescreen. Contemporary scientists now regularly appear in the public eye in contexts other than the straightforward scientific interview. For instance, Professor Richard Dawkins presents prizes to winners of a TV quiz, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on television. No doubt these activities have raised eyebrows in laboratories but they have done more to make scientists recognisable as people than any number of academic papers.
The publishing world is also undergoing a transformation. Scientific biographies and autobiographies, if they appeared at all, used to be rather scholarly but dull and over- reverent. The life which the scientist in question led outside work marriage, children, things most people regard as fairly central to their existence - was often dismissed in a couple of paragraphs. That changed with Richard Feynman's Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?, the hilarious and affecting memoir of a man who also happened to be one of the century's greatest theoretical physicists.
More recently, even the greatest names in science, such as Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Marie Curie have been allowed to appear with all their flaws clearly visible. To the reader, it does not matter that Einstein's relationship with his family is 'irrelevant' to his General Theory of Relativity. The question of how creative genius copes with emotional ups and downs, trivial practicalities, the social demands of ordinary life, is absorbing in its own right.
Dorothy Hodgkin was devoted to her scientific work. Her most important successes were solving the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1964, and of insulin, which her group solved in 1969. In each case she pushed the technique into realms of complexity others deemed unreachable at the time.
But she also had three children to whom she was devoted and was married to a frequently absent husband with a career as a historian. Her personal life is not strictly relevant to her work as a scientist, but surely we can all learn from her capacity to unite the disparate threads of her life into a coherent whole. There is much in her life of universal interest, but it would be disloyal of me to imply that this does not include the science itself. Scientific inquiry was the passion of Hodgkin's life, as it has to be for any successful scientist.
How to communicate the nature of this passion is the hardest task for the scientific biographer. Most readers are not equipped with enough fundamental scientific concepts to grasp more complex ideas without a lot of explanation. Understanding scientific ideas is not really any more difficult than reading Shakespeare or learning a foreign language - it just takes application. It is sad to think that educated people, who would be embarrassed if they fail to recognise the name of some distinguished literary or artistic figure, continue to live in happy ignorance of the rich heritage represented by scientists such as Dorothy Hodgkin.
",C1,"Who is Dorothy Hodgkin?

She was a British scientist. She is the only British woman to win a Nobel Prize. But not many people in Britain know her name.

If a writer won a Nobel Prize, everyone would know their name. But people do not know Dorothy Hodgkin. She was a very special person. Her life was interesting. She lived when more women went to school.

I wanted to write a book about her life. I read other books about scientists. One scientist was Linus Pauling. He was a friend of Dorothy. They both studied the same science. They both wanted to stop nuclear bombs. I went to a bookshop to find a book about him. There was no book. I learned that people in Britain do not want to read about scientists.

Some scientists think books about their lives are boring. So, bookshops do not sell many books about scientists. People think art and science are very different. They think you cannot like both. This is not true.

Scientists have interesting lives, like artists or politicians. But some scientists do not like to be on TV. They think it is not good. This makes people think science is boring. It can stop young people from being scientists.

Now, things are changing. We see scientists on TV more. They are in ads or on game shows. This helps people see that scientists are people like us.

Books about scientists are changing too. Old books were often boring. They only talked about work. Now, books talk about their families and their lives. This makes the books more interesting.

Dorothy Hodgkin loved her work. She found the shapes of important medicines. This is why she won the Nobel Prize.

She also had a family. She had three children. She had a husband who was often away for work. Her family life is not her science, but we can learn from her. She did her work and she had her family.

Her life is interesting for everyone. But her science was very important to her. It is hard to write about this love for science. Many readers do not know much about science. Learning about science is like learning new words – you need to try. It is sad. People know the names of famous artists, but they do not know the names of great scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin.",,"Dorothy who?

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. Georgina Ferry says she should be famous in her own country, but not many people know her.

For the last four years, I have asked my friends a simple question about Dorothy Hodgkin. I tell them I am writing a book about her life. If they look happy and say, ""There must be a book about her already!"", then they know who she is.

Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. If a writer did the same, everyone would know their name. Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was a special person. Her life was as interesting as the crystals she studied. Her life story shows big changes in the 20th century, like better education for women and science becoming more international.

When I started my research, I wanted to read about other scientists. A friend of Hodgkin's told me to read a new book about Linus Pauling. Pauling was a friend of Hodgkin's. They worked in the same type of science and both worked to stop nuclear weapons. I went to the main bookshop in my town, but there was no book about Pauling. I was surprised, but I shouldn't have been. Even though Pauling was a very important chemist and won two Nobel Prizes, British readers didn't seem interested.

Even some scientists think books about scientists' lives are boring. Peter Medawar, who also won a Nobel Prize and helped make organ transplants possible, once wrote that scientists' lives are usually not interesting to read about.

If scientists say this, it's not surprising that bookshops and publishers think the same. This is part of the ""two cultures"" idea – the belief that people in the arts and people in science can't understand each other. Because of this, you usually only find books about the most famous scientists in bookshops.

Of course, it's not true that scientists have less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists are careful about being in the media. A famous geneticist once told me he was happy to talk about his work, but he didn't want his photo taken or his words used directly. He didn't want people to think he was just trying to become famous.

When scientists avoid talking about their personal lives, it gives people the wrong idea about science. This can stop young people from wanting to become scientists and can make the public suspicious of science.

Luckily, this is starting to change. Today, scientists often appear in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car advertisements. Some scientists might not like this, but it helps people see scientists as real people, more than any science paper can.

The world of book publishing is changing too. Books about scientists used to be very serious and boring, and only focused on their work. The scientist's personal life – like their marriage and children – was only mentioned in a few sentences. This changed with a book by Richard Feynman called ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"". It was a funny and moving story about his life, and he was also one of the best physicists of his time.

More recently, books about very famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie show their mistakes and problems too. For the reader, it doesn't matter that Einstein's family life isn't connected to his famous theory. It's interesting to see how a very creative person deals with normal life, emotions, and everyday problems.

Dorothy Hodgkin loved her scientific work. Her most important work was understanding the structure of penicillin, vitamin B12 (which won her the Nobel Prize in 1964), and insulin (which her team solved in 1969). Each time, she used her methods to solve very difficult problems that others thought were impossible.

She also had three children whom she loved very much, and she was married to a historian who was often away from home. Her personal life isn't directly connected to her science, but we can learn from how she managed all the different parts of her life. There are many interesting things about her life, and that includes her science. Science was her great passion, as it must be for any successful scientist.

The most difficult job for someone writing a scientist's life is to explain this passion. Most readers don't know enough science to understand complex ideas without a lot of help. Understanding science isn't harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language – you just need to try. It is sad that educated people would be embarrassed if they didn't know a famous artist or writer, but they are happy not to know about the important work of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin.","Dorothy who?

Why should people in Britain know Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize should be reason enough. If someone in literature had the same achievement, everyone would know their name. Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was an extraordinary person in many ways.

More recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie are shown with their imperfections. Readers are interested in how brilliant people deal with everyday life and emotions, not just their scientific work.

Dorothy Hodgkin was deeply committed to her scientific work. Her biggest achievements were discovering the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12 (which won her the Nobel Prize in 1964), and insulin (which her team solved in 1969).

Long before Titanic, director James Cameron made this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks. Production design and special effects are hugely impressive. It's only the dialogue and characterisation that creak For all the craftsmanship which goes Into the film-making, the story Itself IS strictly B-movie material.

The Thin Red Line
The video release of this version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal directed by Andrew Marton makes a fascinating counterpart to Terrence Malick's new film. Whereas Malick's approach IS mystical and poetic, Marton made a much more conventional war movie. albeit one that is often truer to the book. He concentrated on a single soldier, and on his relationship with his abrasive sergeant. Malick's film IS Infinitely richer and more complex, but Marton's version has ItS moments. The flashback sequence, In which the soldier dreams of the wife he longs for, is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus Imagery of the woman on the swing.

On Guard
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this corny but highly watchable swashbuckler IS a cut above most musketeer adventures It has a consummate villain In Fabrice Luchini's clammy politician, orchestrating death and destruction behind the scenes Vincent Perez makes an exuberant (If rather short-lived) hero, and while Daniel Auteuil is perhaps too moody a presence for a romp like this, he too has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film-makers peddle costume-drama cliches with so much Wit and sparkle It never seems to matter.
D
Character
A handsome but dour tale, set In turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The excessively detailed production and costume design leave the film looking like a museum piece. Taking his cue from the surroundings, Jan Decleir is endlessly morose as the brutal bailiff Dreverhaven, who behaves ruthlessly when evICting tenants. HIS antagonistic relationship with his son IS at the core of the story, but the film-makers seem too busy laYing on the period detail to do Justice to the dark and vicious parable.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
This digitally re-mastered video re-release shows off director Leone's craftsmanship to ItS best advantage. The sound editing, in particular, stands out every footstep, creaking floorboard or barking dog registers loud and clear. The storytelling IS relentlessly cruel and whenever there's a lull, It only takes a burst of Morricone's magnificent music to quicken the pulse On a moral level, there Isn't much to distinguish between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef) and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all of whom seem equally unscrupulous as they maraud across the post- Civil War West.

The Longest Day
'Forty-eight International stars' trumpets the publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic. With four directors and 23,000 extras as well, this is one pudding which is definitely over-egged The early sequences, in which the battle-hardened veterans walt for confirmation of when the invasion will happen, drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers. On a logistical level (If not an aesthetic one), this is an impressive enough feat but it cries out for the big screen Panned and scanned on video, It is inevitably a diminished experience.

A film writer, Nick James, talks about new films.

A  
Abyss  
Before the film Titanic, James Cameron made this film. It is about men on an oil rig and navy men. They try to help a submarine deep under the sea. The men are brave and talk a lot. The film looks very good. But the story is simple.

B  
The Thin Red Line  
This film is from a book. It is about a war on an island. Another film tells the same story. This film is more simple. It is about one soldier and his sergeant. The soldier thinks about his wife. It is a good film.

C  
On Guard  
This is an old-style adventure film. It is fun to watch. There is a very bad man. The hero is happy and brave. Another man is a swordsman. The film is not new, but it is exciting.

D  
Character  
This story is sad. It is in an old city. The clothes and houses look very old. A man is a bailiff. He is not kind to people. He is not kind to his son. The story is dark.

E  
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  
This film is old but looks new now. The sounds are very clear. The story is about three men. They are not good men. They look for money after a war. The music is very good.

F  
The Longest Day  
This is a very long war film. It has many famous actors. It shows soldiers waiting for a big fight. The waiting is long. The film is big, but it is better to see in a cinema. On a small screen, it is not as good.","**Films on Video**
Film expert Nick James talks about some new films you can watch at home.

**A - Abyss**
Director James Cameron made this film before Titanic. It is an exciting story about workers on an oil rig and navy experts. They try to save a nuclear submarine that is stuck deep under the sea. The workers are brave and often make jokes. The film looks very impressive, but the story is quite simple.

**B - The Thin Red Line**
This film is about a famous battle from a book. Another director also made a film about this story. This version is more simple and direct. It follows one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. The other film is more artistic, but this one also has some very good scenes.

**C - On Guard**
This is a fun adventure film with sword fights. It is based on an old story. The villain is a clever politician who plans bad things. The hero is full of energy. The film uses some old-fashioned ideas, but it is so fun to watch that you don't mind.

**D - Character**
This is a serious story that takes place in Rotterdam a long time ago. The clothes and buildings look very old and detailed. The main character is a cruel man who hurts people. He has a very bad relationship with his son. The film looks beautiful, but the story is not very powerful.

**E - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**
This is a famous old film that now looks and sounds much better. You can hear every small sound very clearly. The story is exciting and sometimes violent. The music is wonderful. It is hard to say who is good or bad, because the three main men all do bad things.

**F - The Longest Day**
This is a very long war film with many famous actors. It shows the story of a very important battle. The film has too many characters and stories, so it can be slow and confusing. It is a film that is much better to watch in a cinema. On a television, it is not as exciting.","**Films on Video**  
Film critic Nick James writes about some new films.

**A – Abyss**  
Before the film *Titanic*, director James Cameron made this exciting underwater film. It is about workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep under the sea. The main workers, like Bud and his team, are brave and talk in a funny way. The film looks amazing, with great sets and effects. But the story and the characters are not very deep. It feels like a simple action movie.

**B – The Thin Red Line**  
This film is based on a book about a famous battle. There is a newer film about the same story, but this older one is more like a normal war movie. It follows one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. The new film is more artistic, but this one has some good scenes. For example, when the soldier dreams of his wife, it feels very real and emotional.

**C – On Guard**  
This fun adventure film is based on an old book. It is better than many other films about sword fights. The villain is a clever politician who plans bad things in secret. The hero is full of energy, but he is not in the film for very long. Another actor plays a serious man who used to be an acrobat. The story uses some old ideas, but it is so enjoyable that you don’t mind.

**D – Character**  
This film is set in Rotterdam around 1900. It is a serious story with beautiful costumes and sets, but it sometimes feels like a museum. The main character is a cruel man who throws people out of their homes. His difficult relationship with his son is the main part of the story. But the film focuses too much on the historical details and not enough on the dark story.

**E – The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This film has been improved for video. The director’s work looks and sounds great. You can hear every small sound clearly. The story is very tough, and the music makes it even more exciting. The three main characters—the good, the bad, and the ugly—are all selfish as they travel across America after the Civil War. It is hard to tell who is really good.

**F – The Longest Day**  
This war film is three hours long and has many famous actors. It also used a lot of people to make the battle scenes. But the film is too big and tries to do too much. The beginning is slow, as the soldiers wait for the battle to start. It is an impressive film to make, but it is much better to watch in a cinema. On a small screen, it loses some of its power.","**Films on Video**  
Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases.

**A - Abyss**  
Long before Titanic, director James Cameron made this tense, claustrophobic Cold War film. It follows oil rig workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stuck deep underwater. The conversations and brave humour of the foreman, Bud, and his team remind us of similar quiet heroes in Howard Hawks’ movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive. However, the dialogue and characters feel weak. Despite the high-quality filmmaking, the story itself is quite simple and typical of a B-movie.

**B - The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of James Jones’ novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is an interesting contrast to Terrence Malick’s newer film. Malick’s film is poetic and thoughtful, while Marton’s is a more traditional war movie, although it often follows the book more closely. Marton focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. Malick’s film is deeper and more complex, but Marton’s version also has strong moments. For example, the scene where the soldier dreams of his wife is shown with a harsh realism that may be more effective than Malick’s softer, dreamy style.

**C - On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Féval’s 1875 novel, this old-fashioned but very entertaining adventure film is better than most similar stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a convincing villain—a cold politician who plans violence from behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is quite short. Daniel Auteuil may seem too serious for this kind of fun film, but he also has good moments as an acrobat who becomes a swordsman. The movie uses familiar costume-drama ideas, but it does so with so much energy and cleverness that it doesn’t feel like a problem.

**D - Character**  
This is a good-looking but gloomy story set in Rotterdam around 1900. The detailed sets and costumes make the film look like something from a museum. Jan Decleir plays a cruel bailiff named Dreverhaven, who acts without mercy when forcing people out of their homes. His difficult relationship with his son is the main part of the story, but the filmmakers seem more interested in showing historical details than telling this dark and bitter tale well.

**E - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video version has been digitally improved, so director Leone’s skills are shown at their best. The sound editing is especially clear—you can hear every footstep, creaking floor, or barking dog. The story is very cruel, and whenever the action slows down, Morricone’s powerful music makes it exciting again. In terms of morals, there isn’t much difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee Van Cleef), and the ugly (Eli Wallach). They all seem equally dishonest as they travel across the American West after the Civil War.

**F - The Longest Day**  
The advertising for this three-hour war film by Darryl Zanuck boasts “forty-eight international stars.” With four directors and thousands of extras, the film tries to do too much. The early scenes, where experienced soldiers wait to hear when the invasion will start, feel slow for both the audience and the characters. On a technical level, the film is impressive, but it really needs to be seen in a cinema. On a small screen, the experience is much less powerful.",,
256,"Under Sarah's Spell
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt
There cannot he many artists who l10 not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist, is one. She is not remotely interested in the concept
of the artist as creator, let alone that of the artist as genius: 'It's not the artist
who is important, but the work,' she states. Janson is so self-deprecating that she would almost like you to believe that her trompe-l'oeil works paint themselves.
All of which does not bode well for a magazine interview. 'I just don't like to shout about myself,' she says, and then covers her face in horror when asked if she minds being photographed for the feature, Cut to her sitting room 30 minutes later (a wonderful space in a Hock of artists' studios in London, filled with paintings and drawings) and you find two women bent double with hysteria. Her confidence gained, the interview becomes a fascinating, amusing (and sometimes hilarious) encounter.
Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, after two years' solid drawing at art school ('the best training any artist can ever have'}, a degree in graphic illustration and a stint at a publishing house. But illustration never really satisfied her, and she joined a specialist decorator, Jim Smart ('one of the best in his day'). Smart asked her to do one trompe-l'oeil, and that was it. 'Suddenly my interest got channelled,' she says, She left to set up on her own, 'not really knowing where I was going, hut feeling that I was on the road to somewhere.' Her instinct was right.
Janson's observational skills and fascination with detail (gained through illustrating) proved essential qualities for a trompe-l'oeil artist. 'People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation.' She insists (in that self-deprecating way) that she is still learning. 'The moment you think that you've mastered a field you might as well give up.' She is also brutally honest about her 'failings' ('I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete') and is frank about her mathematical abilities. Faced with a huge commission for the domed chapel ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she became totally confused when calculating measurements. 'I thought to myself, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you
think you are?""' This habit of self-questioning and a reluctance to openly acknowledge her skills has spawned an oddly distanced attitude to her talent. Janson often speaks in the third person: 'When I finished that ceiling, I thought, ""Well I didn't do it, she did"".'
Of course, her trompe-l'oeil schemes can speak for themselves. Janson's work is in a league of its own, far above those who have jumped on the bandwagon (the art of trompe-l'oeil has experienced something of a revival, hut not with entirely satisfactory results) and she has a string of major corporate and private commissions behind her. Much of her work is inspired by architecture or made for architectural settings. There is the trompe-l'oeil dining room for one client, based on the facade of a Venetian palazzo, and the painting at the end of a corridor in a Hat, which gives the illusion that you can step into two further rooms.
There is always a danger with trompe-l'oeil, though, that once you get the joke, your attention is lost, something of which Janson is acutely aware. 'Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and then engage your imagination. That is the most important part.'
While trompe-l'oeil has to be clever, it must also, Janson believes, be personal to the client. 'I love the interaction with clients; hat is where the ideas arc horn,' she says. 'Without the rapport, the job of creating a trompe-l'oeil scheme becomes rather difficult. Some clients have firm ideas about what they want; others do not. You have to he willing to listen. You have to get inside a client's imagination.' Many have become friends, nut least because Janson practically lives with them if she works on site.
Janson is generous in praise of her clients. 'I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls.' she confesses. And, they too, seem delighted with her, which is why she is constantly busy - despite her inclination to play down her talent. 'I really don't like to shout about myself,' she repeats at the end. 'Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout.' True, perhaps, hut you could never really become bored with Janson or her work. It certainly deserves to become better known, and I am prepared to incur her wrath while I blow her trumpet.
",C1,"Sarah's Magic

Sarah Janson is an artist. She makes paintings that look real. Joanna Watt talks to her.

Not many artists wait to sign their work. Sarah is one. She says the art is important, not the artist. She is very quiet about her work. She almost wants you to think the paintings make themselves.

This is hard for a magazine talk. ""I do not like to talk about me,"" she says. She does not want her photo taken. But later, in her home, she is happy and laughing. Now the talk is good and fun.

Sarah has made this art for sixteen years. She went to art school. She learned to draw. She worked at a book company. But she was not happy. Then she worked with a man named Jim Smart. He asked her to make one special painting. She liked it very much. She started her own work. It was the right thing for her.

Sarah is good at seeing small things. This helps her art. People ask where to learn her art. She says you cannot learn in school. You learn by looking at the world. She says she is still learning. She says what she cannot do well. She says she cannot paint bread. It looks bad. She says she is not good with numbers. One time, she had a big job on a ceiling. She felt bad. She thought, ""I am not a great artist."" She does not say she is good. Sometimes she talks like she is another person. She says, ""She did it, not me.""

Her art is very good. It is better than other art. Many people ask her to work. Her art is often about houses and buildings. For one person, she made a dining room look like a house in Venice. For another, she made a painting in a hall. It looks like you can walk into two rooms.

But there is a problem with this art. When you see the trick, you may stop looking. Sarah knows this. She says her art must do two things. First, it must trick your eyes. Second, it must make you look and think. This is very important.

Sarah says the art must be smart, but it must also be for the person. She likes talking to the people who ask for her art. Ideas come from them. It is hard to work if they do not talk well. Some people know what they want. Some do not. She must listen to them. She must know what they think. Many people become her friends. This is because she works in their houses.

Sarah is happy about the people who ask for her art. She says, ""I like the people who let me paint their walls."" They like her art too. She is always busy, even though she does not talk about her art.

""I really do not like to talk about me,"" she says again. ""Like my art, I am quiet. I do not want my art to be loud. You do not like loud things."" This may be true, but you always like Sarah and her art. More people should know about her art. I will talk about her, even if she is not happy with me.",,"Under Sarah's Spell

Sarah Janson is an artist who creates paintings that trick your eyes. They look so real that you might think they are real objects. Joanna Watt interviews her here.

Not many artists wait to be asked before they sign their work, but Sarah is one of them. She doesn't believe the artist is the most important thing. ""It's the work that matters, not the artist,"" she says. Sarah is so modest that she almost wants you to think her paintings create themselves.

This made the magazine interview difficult at first. ""I just don't like to talk a lot about myself,"" she explains. She was even nervous about having her photo taken. But 30 minutes later, in her living room (a lovely room in a London building for artists, full of paintings), the two women were laughing a lot. Sarah became more comfortable, and the interview turned into a fun and interesting conversation.

Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, which she calls the best training. She also got a degree in illustration and worked at a publishing house. But she wasn't happy with illustration work. Then she started working with a specialist decorator, Jim Smart. He asked her to try trompe-l'oeil, and she loved it immediately. ""Suddenly, I knew what I wanted to do,"" she says. She started her own business, feeling she was going in the right direction. Her feeling was correct.

Sarah's ability to notice small details, which she learned from illustration, is very important for her work. ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. You learn from life. It's all about looking carefully,"" she explains. She says she is still learning. ""The moment you think you know everything, you should stop."" She is also very honest about what she finds difficult. For example, she says she can't paint bread well. When she had to paint a large ceiling, she felt unsure. ""I thought, 'You are not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?'"" Because she questions herself and doesn't like to talk about her skills, she sometimes feels separate from her own talent. She even talks about herself as another person sometimes: ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""

Of course, her work speaks for itself. Sarah's art is much better than others who have started doing trompe-l'oeil recently. She has done many important jobs for companies and private clients. A lot of her work is about buildings or made for buildings. For one client, she painted a dining room to look like the front of a Venetian palace. For another, she painted the end of a hallway in a flat, making it look like there are two more rooms you can walk into.

However, there is a problem with trompe-l'oeil. Once you understand the trick, you might lose interest. Sarah knows this well. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things,"" she says. ""First, it must trick you. Secondly, it must keep your interest and make you imagine. That is the most important part.""

Sarah believes trompe-l'oeil must be clever, but it also has to be personal for the client. ""I love working with clients; that's where the ideas come from,"" she says. ""Without a good relationship, the job is very difficult. Some clients know what they want; others don't. You have to be ready to listen. You have to understand what the client imagines."" Many of her clients have become her friends, especially because she often works in their homes.

Sarah is very thankful to her clients. ""I am very grateful to the brave ones who let me paint on their walls,"" she says. And they are very happy with her work, which is why she is always busy - even though she doesn't like to talk about her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she says again at the end. ""Like my work, I am quiet. I don't want my work to shout. You get bored with things that shout."" This might be true, but you could never get bored with Sarah or her work. Her art should be more famous, and I am ready to make her a little angry by telling everyone how good she is.","Under Sarah's Spell

Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These are designed to trick the eye by creating realistic illusions. Joanna Watt interviews her here.

Not many artists refuse to sign their work unless asked. Sarah Janson is one of them. She is not at all interested in the idea of the artist as a special creator. ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work,"" she says. Janson is so modest that she almost wants you to think her paintings create themselves.

This attitude is not ideal for a magazine interview. ""I just don't like to talk a lot about myself,"" she explains. She even covers her face when asked if a photo is okay. But 30 minutes later, in her living room (a wonderful space in a London artists' building, full of paintings), you find two women laughing a lot. Once she feels more comfortable, the interview becomes a fascinating and very funny conversation.

But illustration never really made her happy. She then started working for a specialist decorator, Jim Smart (""one of the best""). He asked her to try one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that was the start. ""Suddenly my interest had a direction,"" she says. She left to work for herself, ""not really knowing where I was going, but feeling that I was on the right path."" Her feeling was correct.

Janson's ability to observe things and her interest in detail (skills she learned from illustration) are perfect for a trompe-l'oeil artist. ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. It's the school of life. It's all about observation."" She modestly insists that she is still learning. ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well stop."" She is also very honest about what she finds difficult (""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete"") and about her maths skills. When she had to paint a huge ceiling in a chapel, she got completely confused with the measurements. ""I thought to myself, 'You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?'""

This habit of doubting herself and not wanting to admit her skills means she sometimes talks about her talent as if it belongs to someone else. Janson often uses the third person: ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well I didn't do it, she did'.""

Of course, her trompe-l'oeil work speaks for itself. Janson's skill is in a class of its own, much better than others who have recently tried the style. She has completed many important jobs for companies and private clients. A lot of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she painted a dining room for a client to look like the front of a Venetian building. In a flat, she painted the end of a corridor to give the illusion of two more rooms.

There is a risk with trompe-l'oeil, however. Once you understand the trick, you might lose interest. Janson knows this very well. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in and trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and then make you use your imagination. That is the most important part.""

While trompe-l'oeil has to be clever, Janson also believes it must be personal for the client. ""I love working with clients; that is where the ideas come from,"" she says. ""Without a good relationship, creating a trompe-l'oeil becomes very difficult. Some clients know exactly what they want; others do not. You have to be willing to listen. You have to understand a client's imagination."" Many clients have become her friends, especially because she often lives with them while working on a project.

Janson is generous in praising her clients. ""I am very grateful for the brave ones who have let me paint freely on their walls,"" she admits. They also seem very happy with her, which is why she is always busy - even though she prefers not to talk about her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she says again at the end. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" This may be true, but you could never become bored with Janson or her work. It certainly deserves to be more famous, and I am ready to face her anger while I sing her praises.",,
257,"THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS
The best boat design should combine old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft, 'The Westerman'.
This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts, bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. By contrast, my own lies quietly on a tidal creek off the south coast. She was designed last year but, seeing her, you might imagine her to be 100 years old and think that her owner must be some kind of lost-soul romantic.
Perhaps I am, though I doubt it. This boat has benefited from all the magic of old-fashioned boat design, but it would have been a much harder job without the advances of modern know-how.
It has to be said, however, that despite being an indispensable tool in current design methods and boat-building practice, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life. These are often the very realities they hoped to rediscover by going to sea in the first place.
It's not that I'm suggesting that sailors should go back to enduring every hardship. It's always been important to me that my boats have a coal stove for warmth and dryness and cosy berths for sleeping. But why go cruising at all if every sail sets and furls itself?
The occasional battle with flapping canvas is surely part of a seaman's life. And for what purpose should we abandon common sense and move our steering positions from the security of the aft end to some vulnerable perch half-way to the bow? The sad answer is that this creates a cabin like that of an ocean liner, with space for a bed larger than the one at home.
For me a boat should always be a boat and not a cottage on the water. When I bought an earlier boat, Hirta, in which I circumnavigated Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner observed that she had every comfort, but no luxury. During my long relationship with her, Hirta taught me how wise he was.
Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity to speak of, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and absolutely no electronics, especially in the navigation department, yet she was the kindest, easiest boat that I have ever sailed at sea.
Back on land, however, it is a sad fact that the very antiquity of classic boats means that they need a lot of looking after. When I had a bad injury to my back, I realised that my IS-year love affair with her had to end. Searching for a younger replacement produced no credible contenders, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch.
The Westerman has never disappointed me. Although Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his right-hand man, are adept with computer-assisted design programs, Irens initially drew this boat on a paper napkin, and only later transferred his ideas to the computer. After this had generated a set of lines, he carved a model, just as boatyards did in the days of sail. Together we considered the primary embryonic vessel, then fed the design back into the electronic box for modification.
The next version was nearly right and by the time the final one appeared, the form was perfect. The completed boat has now crossed the North Atlantic and has won four out of her first six racing starts,
Her appearance is ageless, her motion at sea is a pleasure and her accommodation, much of it in reclaimed pitch pine, emanates an atmosphere of deep peace. Maybe this is because she was drawn purely as a sailing craft, without reference to any furniture we might put into her. That is the well-tried method of the sea.
In her timeless serenity, she is the living proof that it works; that there is no need to follow current fashions to find satisfaction. and that sometimes it pays to listen to the lessons of history.
Constructed in timber treated with a penetrating glue, she is totally impervious to water. Thus she has all the benefits of a glass fibre boat yet looks like, feels like and sails like the real thing. ",C1,"My Dream Boat

I like boats. I have a boat. It is called 'The Westerman'.

There is a boat show in London. There are many new boats. My boat is not there. My boat is in the water in the south. My boat is new, but it looks old.

I like old boats and new boats. My boat has good things from old boats. I also used new ideas.

New boats are easy. But I like to work on my boat. I like to use the sails. That is part of sailing.

My boat is good inside. It has a warm stove. It has good beds. But it is a boat, not a house.

I had an old boat before. It was called Hirta. I sailed it around Britain. It had no lights. It had no cold box for food. It had no computer. But it was a very good boat.

Old boats need a lot of work. My back hurt. I could not keep the old boat. I looked for a new boat. I did not find one. So I made a new boat.

My new boat is The Westerman. A man drew the boat on paper. Then he used a computer. He made a small boat from wood. We looked at the small boat. We changed the plan.

Now the boat is very good. It sailed across the big ocean. It won four races.

The boat looks old and nice. It moves well on the water. Inside, it is quiet and good. We made the boat for sailing. This is a good way to make a boat.

The boat is made of wood with strong glue. Water cannot hurt it. It is strong like a plastic boat. But it looks and feels like a real wood boat.","My Dream Boat

A good boat should have both old and new ideas, says Tom Cunliffe. He made his own boat, 'The Westerman', this way.

This week, the Summer Boat Show in London has many beautiful boats with new technology. Most of these boats look very modern. My boat is different. It sits quietly on the water near the south coast. It was made last year, but it looks 100 years old. You might think its owner loves old things.

Maybe I do. This boat uses the best ideas from old boat design. But it was easier to build because of new technology.

New technology is very helpful for building boats. But sometimes it means sailors do not feel the real sea life. Many people go to sea to feel this real life.

I do not think sailors should have a difficult life. I like my boats to have a coal stove to stay warm and dry, and good beds for sleeping. But why go sailing if the boat does everything for you?

Sometimes fighting with the sails is part of a sailor's life. Why do we put the steering wheel in a dangerous place near the front of the boat? The answer is to make a big cabin with a very big bed.

For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. I had another boat before, called Hirta. I sailed around Britain in it for a TV show. The man who had the boat before me said it was comfortable, but not fancy. After sailing Hirta for a long time, I learned he was right.

Hirta's sails were heavy. It had no running water, no real electricity, no fridge, no heating, and no electronics for finding the way. But it was the best and easiest boat I ever sailed.

But old boats need a lot of work. I hurt my back badly, so I could not look after Hirta anymore. I looked for a new boat but did not find one. So I decided to build a new boat.

The Westerman is a great boat. The designer, Nigel Irens, and his helper, Ed Burnett, are good with computer design. But Nigel first drew this boat on a paper napkin. Later, he put the ideas on the computer. The computer made a plan, and then he made a small model of the boat, like they did in the old days. We looked at the model together and then changed the design on the computer.

The next plan was almost right. The final plan was perfect. The finished boat has sailed across the North Atlantic and has won four of its first six races.

The boat looks old and new at the same time. It moves beautifully on the water. Inside, it has old wood and feels very peaceful. This is because it was designed first as a sailing boat, not as a place for furniture. This is the old way to make boats.

The Westerman shows that you do not need to follow new styles to be happy. Sometimes, it is good to learn from the past.

The boat is made of wood with a special glue, so no water can get in. It has all the good things of a modern plastic boat, but it looks, feels, and sails like a real wooden boat.","My Dream Boat

A great boat should mix old and new ideas, says Tom Cunliffe. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'.

This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with the newest technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat shape that happened 25 years ago. My boat, however, sits quietly in a river on the south coast. It was designed last year, but you might think it is 100 years old. You might think its owner is a romantic person who loves old things.

Maybe I am that person, but I don't think so. This boat uses the best of old boat design, but it was easier to build because of modern knowledge.

Still, modern technology often protects sailors from the difficult parts of life at sea. But these difficult parts are often the reason people want to sail in the first place.

I don't think sailors should have a hard time all the time. I always want my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and dry air, and comfortable beds for sleeping. But why go sailing if the sails put themselves up and down?

Sometimes fighting with a sail is just part of a sailor's life. And why should we move the steering wheel from the safe back of the boat to a less safe spot near the front? The reason is sad: it makes space for a very big bed, like in a hotel.

For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my last boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV show, the person who had it before me said it had everything you need, but nothing extra. After sailing her for a long time, I learned how right he was.

Her sails were heavy, and she had no running water, almost no electricity, no fridge, no heating, no special handles to pull ropes, and no electronics for finding the way. But she was the nicest and easiest boat I have ever sailed.

But on land, old boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back badly, I knew my 15-year time with her had to end. I looked for a newer boat but couldn't find a good one. So I decided to build a new boat myself.

The Westerman has been perfect for me. The designer, Nigel Irens, and his helper, Ed Burnett, are good with computer design programs. But Irens first drew this boat on a paper napkin. Only later did he put the design on the computer. After the computer made the plans, he made a small model, just like boat builders did in the old days. We looked at the first model together, then changed the design on the computer.

The next design was almost right, and the final one was perfect. The finished boat has sailed across the North Atlantic and has won four of her first six races.

She looks like she could be from any time. She moves beautifully on the water. Inside, she has old wood that makes you feel very calm. Maybe this is because she was designed first as a sailing boat, without thinking about the furniture inside. This is the old, trusted way of the sea.

In her calm and timeless way, she shows that this method works. You don't need to follow new styles to be happy. Sometimes, it is good to learn from the past.

She is built with wood and a special glue that keeps water out. So she has all the good points of a modern plastic boat, but she looks, feels, and sails like a real wooden boat.",,,
258,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet 
Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Yet one of his greatest accomplishments, in the eyes of his contemporaries, was to chart, using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore, the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now known as 'declination', that is, the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without it, sailors were unable to correct their compasses. It was therefore impossible to deduce longitude precisely and navigate the oceans.
So it was that Halley, one of only two men in the land at that time paid to conduct scientific research, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands with the grand plan of charting declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time.
This voyage took him and his crew to Rio de Janeiro, down past South Georgia, up again to Newfoundland and back to England. From these travels Halley published, in 170I, a 'New and Correct Chart shewing the Variations of the Compasse in the Western and Southern Oceans'. More sophisticated successors to this primitive cartographic effort proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century, before a slow change in the terrestrial magnetic field rendered them inaccurate.
If all goes well, Halley's accomplishments will be celebrated once again. Dr Clark, himself a keen sailor, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore.
PS70,000 will have to be raised before he embarks, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is providing support for his efforts to do this. Dr Clark became fascinated by Halley during a two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read biographies of the great scientist. 
'Halley led a remarkable life: Dr Clark says. 'He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the positions of the stars, and also found time for other interests.'
It was during this period that Halley developed a diving bell and also advised Sir Isaac Newton during his writing of Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Recreating the voyage, Dr Clark says, will afford Halley the recognition he deserves. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific merit.
It will involve making the measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. These measurements need to be updated because the terrestrial magnetic field is slowly but constantly changing.
The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field, called the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. That's because you need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr Clark.
'On our expedition we can use global positioning satellites to determine that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have offered to supply instruments. By chance, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements over the globe.
Dr Clark hopes that his measurements will plug any gaps in its coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and, he points out, it is also useful to have ground-based measurements as a comparison. It is easy to forget just how significant Halley's Atlantic journey really was. It was the first dedicated scientific expedition on the seas and Halley became the first civilian who was appointed naval captain to pursue what many regarded as an obsession with declination. Does Dr Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success?
As well as spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews.
And does he share Halley's obsessive trait? 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose.'
",C1,,,"Looking for true north - and the man connected to Halley's comet

Dr Toby Clark, a scientist at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley. Halley tried to map the differences in how compasses work. Anjana Ahuja writes about this.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is most famous for the comet named after him. But people in his time also thought one of his greatest works was mapping the 'variations of the compass'. He did this using maths from his sea trips on a ship called the Paramore. These variations are now called 'declination'. This is the angle between magnetic north and real, or 'true', north. Without knowing this, sailors could not fix their compasses. This made it very hard to know their exact position at sea and to sail the oceans safely.

Because of this, Halley, one of only two men in the country who was paid to do science, sailed to the Cape Verde Islands. His big plan was to map declination in the North and South Atlantic. The first trip had to stop early because the crew did not follow orders. But Halley went to sea a second time.

This second voyage took him and his crew to Rio de Janeiro, past South Georgia, up to Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a new map in 1701. It showed the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. Better maps that came later were very important for sailors for over one hundred years. Then, slow changes in the Earth's magnetic field made the old maps wrong.

If everything goes to plan, people will remember Halley's work again. Dr Clark, who also loves sailing, wants to follow the route of the Paramore. He is doing this for the 300-year anniversary of Halley's trip.

First, he needs to raise £70,000. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first trip across Antarctica, is helping him. Dr Clark became very interested in Halley when he worked for two years at Halley Station in Antarctica. There, he read books about the scientist's life.

""Halley had a remarkable life,"" Dr Clark says. ""He was not only a famous scientist but also led trips. He was an astronomer, but he also studied geophysics. When he was the Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and had time for other hobbies.""

It was during this time that Halley made a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton write his important book, Principia Mathematica. Dr Clark says that by doing the voyage again, Halley will get the recognition he should have. The planned trip, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also be good for science.

They will take the same measurements that Halley made, but they will use much better tools. These measurements need to be new because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing slowly.

The information they collect should help improve the current mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field. This model is called the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is normal to measure how strong the magnetic field is, but not its direction,"" says Dr Clark. ""That's because you need to know where true north is to measure the direction. On our trip, we can use GPS satellites to find true north.""

The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have said they will give them instruments. By luck, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements from space. Dr Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any missing information over the Atlantic Ocean. He also says it is useful to have measurements from the ground to compare with the satellite.

It is easy to forget how important Halley's Atlantic journey was. It was the first sea trip just for science. Halley became the first non-military person to be made a ship captain to follow his strong interest in declination.

Does Dr Clark have the right experience to make his similar trip a success? He has worked for two years in Antarctica and in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to do the expedition in four parts, with a different crew for each part.

And does he have the same strong interest as Halley? ""I am ready to give eight months of my life to do this,"" he says, ""so maybe some people think I am obsessed. But I would not want to sail across the Atlantic again without a very good reason. Halley and his interesting life have given me a real purpose.""","Looking for true north - and the man connected to Halley's comet

259,"Beginner Takes All
Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph
The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans, screenwriter, producer and aspiring director. The year began badly when Life and Limb, a film project he had been working on for months, fell through 'almost overnight'. His disappointment mingled with stomach-churning worry: it had been two years since he had earned any money and the promise of that film had been the only buffer between him and an increasingly irate bank manager.
A wise man, finding himself in Evans' position, would have got a job. He could have gone back to being a television executive, or begun a television project that had been on hold. Instead, he made a decision that most people, Evans included, would consider insane. He bought a ticket to America and set off for three months to research his first novel.
Although he was acting very much on impulse, the seeds for the story had been with him for some time, sown by a farrier he met on Dartmoor while staying with a friend. The farrier had told him the story of a docile horse that had turned, no one knew why, into a fiend. Its owners were desperate until they heard of a gypsy who, simply by talking to the animal, transformed its temperament in a matter of hours. Such men, the farrier said, were known as 'horse whisperers'.
Evans' imagination was captured. He began researching the subject with a view to writing a screenplay - he was, after all, a film-maker. But disillusionment with the film world following the demise of Life and Limb prompted him to write the story as a book. And so throughout the spring he drove across the US, stopping at ranches and learning about horses and the men who work with them.
'It was a funny time,' he says now. 'I was observing people, but essentially [ was alone and I really felt as though my life was falling apart. ['d tried for ten years to make a go of it as a film-maker, and here 1was, hugely in debt and wondering how [ was going to feed the children, and thinking maybe it was all just folly.'
He thought that again towards the end of August, by which time he had returned home and written the first half of the book. 'At that point the bank manager was getting really very heavy with us, and I needed to know whether it was worth going on. I plucked up the courage to show it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and said it was ""fine"".'
When pushed, he ventured that Evans might get $30,000 as an advance on the book. 'I had in mind how much 1 needed to payoff a bit of the overdraft and keep us going, and it was more than that. ['d spent seven months on The Horse Whisperer, and there were at least another two to go. $30,000 was a really difficult figure. I was also advised to write a 12-page synopsis of the remainder of the book.'
In October. together with the first two hundred pages of the novel. this was sent to seven UK publishers on the eve of their departure for the annual spending spree at the internationally renowned Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days his agent was on the telephone to report that he had just turned down the first offer of $75,000. 'I said, ""You what?"" And he said, ""It's OK, I just sense something is happening"". '
The events that followed have become publishing history. Within a week - a week of hotly contested auctions - the novel had been sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for 5550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for 53.I5 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel.
'We couldn't believe it; we sat there with our jaws gaping. W e'd never sent the manuscript to New York, we still don't know how it got there,' Evans says. Nor did they send it to Hollywood, but within that same week the major studios were fighting over it. 'My agent in the UK wisely involved an agent over there and when he phoned us to say, ""I think we can get $3 million outright,"" we laughed in disbelief.'
As they all agreed to this sum, it was decided that they should each 'pitch' to Evans. And so, one night in October, he sat in his study while four great film-makers rang, one after the other, to beg for the privilege of paying 53 million for an unfinished novel. Evans told me all this as we sat drinking coffee on a wooden verandah perched above the leafy garden of his home. He said that he had since turned down an offer to write the screenplay of Tile Horse Whisperer.
'It's all been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to spoil it. Writing at that level is a very tough business, and I don't want to become an employee of these people who I like and who have paid me so much money. I'd hate to find myself writing a draft or two and then have them say, ""Thanks Nick, but now we'll bring in so-and-so"". '
He would be involved, he said, but at arm's length. The success of his novel had inevitably brought forth the offer of new backing for Life and Limb, but he was no longer sure that he wanted to make it. 'I think that I would be foolish not to write another novel,' he said.",C1,,"**A Beginner's Big Win**

Before it was in the shops, ""The Horse Whisperer"" was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first book by British writer Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about his idea and his success.

The year started badly for Nicholas Evans. He writes for films. A film he worked on for a long time suddenly stopped. He was sad and worried. He had no money for two years. The film was his only hope.

A smart person would have found a job. He could have gone back to his old work on television. But he did something crazy. He bought a ticket to America. He went for three months to learn about his first book.

He heard the story idea before. A man told him a story. The man told him about a quiet horse. The horse suddenly became very angry. No one knew why. The horse's owners were very sad. Then they found a special man, a gypsy. The gypsy talked to the horse and changed it in a few hours. People call men like this ""horse whisperers.""

Evans loved this idea. First, he wanted to write a film. But after his film stopped, he decided to write a book. So, in the spring, he drove across America. He went to farms and learned about horses and the people who work with them.

""It was a strange time,"" he says now. ""I watched people, but I was alone. I felt my life was breaking. I tried for ten years to make films. Now I had a lot of money problems. I thought about how to buy food for my children. I thought maybe it was a big mistake.""

He felt the same at the end of August. He was home and wrote half the book. The bank manager was very angry. He needed to know if he should finish the book. He was brave and showed it to a friend. His friend works with books. The friend read it and said it was ""okay.""

The friend thought Evans might get $30,000 for the book. Evans needed more money than that. He worked on the book for seven months and needed two more. $30,000 was not enough. He also had to write a short plan for the rest of the story.

In October, he sent the first 200 pages and the plan to seven book companies in the UK. This was just before a big book fair. A few days later, his friend called him. The friend said no to the first offer of $75,000. Evans was very surprised. His friend said, ""It's okay, I feel something good is coming.""

What happened next is now famous. In one week, many people wanted to buy the book. A UK book company paid a lot of money for it. A US book company paid even more money for it. This was the most money ever for a first book.

""We could not believe it. We sat with our mouths open. We never sent the book to New York. We still do not know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but the big film companies wanted it that same week. ""My friend in the UK called a friend in America. He called us and said, 'I think we can get $3 million for the film.' We laughed because it was hard to believe.""

They all agreed on the price. Then, four famous film-makers called Evans, one after the other. They all wanted to pay $3 million for his unfinished book.

Evans told me this story while we drank coffee at his house. He said he later said no to writing the film for ""The Horse Whisperer.""

""Everything has been like a dream. I do not want to break it. Writing for films is very hard. I do not want to work for the people who paid me. I would be sad to write the film and then have them say, 'Thank you, but we will ask another writer.'""

He said he will help, but not too much. His book's success also brought new money for his old film. But now he is not sure he wants to make it.

""I think I would be silly not to write another book,"" he said.","**Beginner Takes All**

Even before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about his ideas and his success.

The start of the year was not good for Nicholas Evans, a screenwriter, producer, and someone who wanted to be a director. The year began badly when *Life and Limb*, a film he had worked on for months, suddenly stopped. He was very disappointed and worried. He had not earned any money for two years, and the hope from that film was the only thing keeping his bank manager from getting angry.

A sensible person in his situation would have found a job. He could have returned to his old job in television or started a television project he had paused. Instead, he did something that most people, including himself, would think was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months there doing research for his first book.

Although it was a quick decision, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. It started when he met a man who cares for horses' feet on Dartmoor. This man told him a story about a calm horse that suddenly became very angry. No one knew why. The owners did not know what to do until they heard about a traveller who could change the horse's behaviour just by talking to it. The man said such people are called 'horse whisperers'.

Evans loved this idea. He started to learn more about it because he wanted to write a film script – he was, after all, a film-maker. But after his film *Life and Limb* failed, he felt unhappy with the film world. This made him decide to write the story as a book. So, during the spring, he drove across the United States. He visited farms and learned about horses and the people who work with them.

'It was a strange time,' he says now. 'I was watching people, but I was mostly alone and I really felt like my life was breaking into pieces. I had tried for ten years to be successful as a film-maker. Now I was here, with a lot of debt, wondering how I would feed my children, and thinking that maybe it was all a big mistake.'

He felt the same way near the end of August. He was back home and had written the first half of the book. 'At that time, the bank manager was putting a lot of pressure on us. I needed to know if I should continue writing. I was brave and showed it to a friend who was a book agent. He read it and said it was ""fine"".'

When my friend said more, he thought I might get $30,000 as an early payment for the book. 'I was thinking about how much money I needed to pay back some debt and support my family, and it was more than $30,000. I had already spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and needed at least two more months. $30,000 was a difficult amount. I was also told to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.'

In October, the first two hundred pages of the book and the summary were sent to seven UK publishers. This happened just before they left for the important Frankfurt Book Fair. A few days later, his agent called to say he had just said no to the first offer of $75,000. 'I said, ""You did what?"" And he said, ""It's OK, I just feel something is happening"".'

What happened next is now famous in the book world. In just one week, there were many high offers for the book. It was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million. These were the highest amounts ever paid for a first novel.

'We couldn't believe it; we just sat there with our mouths open in surprise. We never sent the book to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,' Evans says. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but in that same week, the big film studios were fighting to buy it. 'My agent in the UK cleverly asked an agent in America for help. When he called us to say, ""I think we can get $3 million for the film rights,"" we laughed because we couldn't believe it.'

After they agreed on this price, the studios each had to call Evans to ask for the book. So, one night in October, he sat in his office while four famous film-makers called him, one after another, to ask for the chance to pay $3 million for an unfinished book.

Evans told me all this as we drank coffee on the wooden balcony of his home, which looks over his green garden. He said that he later said no to an offer to write the film script for *The Horse Whisperer*.

'Everything has been like a fairy tale until now. I don't want to ruin it. Writing film scripts at that level is very hard work. I don't want to work for these people, even though I like them and they paid me a lot of money. I would hate to write one or two versions and then have them say, ""Thanks Nick, but now we will get someone else"".'

He said he would be involved, but not too closely. The success of his book also meant people offered new money to make *Life and Limb*. But he was not sure he wanted to make that film anymore. 'I think I would be silly not to write another book,' he said.","**A Beginner's Success**

Even before its publication, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most anticipated book of the year. This debut novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans earned its author an extraordinary amount of money. In this interview, he discusses his inspiration and his remarkable success.

The beginning of the year was a difficult period for Nicholas Evans, a screenwriter, producer, and aspiring director. It started badly when *Life and Limb*, a film project he had been developing for months, collapsed unexpectedly. His disappointment was mixed with deep anxiety; he had not earned any money for two years, and the potential of that film had been the only thing preventing his bank manager from becoming increasingly angry.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to his previous role as a television executive or resumed a television project that was on hold. Instead, he made a decision that most people, himself included, would consider irrational. He purchased a ticket to America and spent three months there researching his first novel.

Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been developing for some time. It began when he met a farrier while visiting a friend on Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that had suddenly become aggressive for no apparent reason. The owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who, simply by talking to the animal, completely transformed its behaviour within a few hours. The farrier explained that such individuals were known as 'horse whisperers'.

Evans was fascinated by the idea. He began to research the subject, initially intending to write a screenplay, as he was, after all, a film-maker. However, his frustration with the film industry following the failure of *Life and Limb* led him to write the story as a book instead. Throughout the spring, he drove across the United States, stopping at ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them.

'It was a strange period,' he recalls. 'I was observing people, but I was essentially alone and I truly felt my life was falling apart. I had spent ten years trying to succeed as a film-maker, and there I was, deeply in debt, worrying about how to provide for my children, and wondering if it had all been a terrible mistake.'

He experienced similar doubts towards the end of August. By then, he had returned home and written the first half of the book. 'At that stage, the bank manager was putting serious pressure on us, and I needed to know if it was worthwhile to continue. I gathered the courage to show it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and described it as ""fine"".'

When pressed for an opinion, the agent suggested that Evans might receive a $30,000 advance for the book. 'I was calculating how much I needed to reduce my overdraft and support my family, and it was more than that. I had already invested seven months in *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more to go. $30,000 was a very challenging figure. I was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.'

In October, this summary and the first two hundred pages of the novel were sent to seven UK publishers, just before they departed for the major Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to report that he had just turned down an initial offer of $75,000. 'I said, ""You did what?"" And he replied, ""It's alright, I just have a feeling something significant is happening"".'

The events that followed are now publishing history. Within a week—a week of fiercely competitive auctions—the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record-breaking sums for a first novel.

'We were astonished; we sat there with our mouths open. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,' Evans says. They also hadn't sent it to Hollywood, yet within that same week, major film studios were competing for the rights. 'My UK agent wisely involved an American agent, and when he phoned to say, ""I believe we can get $3 million for the film rights,"" we laughed in disbelief.'

Once they agreed on this amount, it was decided that the studios should each present their vision to Evans. Consequently, one night in October, he sat in his study while four major film-makers called him, one after another, to plead for the opportunity to pay $3 million for an unfinished book. Evans shared this story as we drank coffee on the wooden veranda of his home, which overlooks a leafy garden. He added that he has since declined an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*.

'Everything so far has been like a fairy tale. I don't want to spoil it. Writing at that professional level is extremely demanding, and I don't want to become an employee of these people, even though I like them and they have paid me a great deal. I would hate to write a couple of drafts only for them to say, ""Thanks Nick, but we're bringing in someone else now"".'

He stated that he would be involved, but would maintain a certain distance. The success of his novel also resulted in new offers of financial backing for *Life and Limb*, but he was no longer certain he wanted to make that film. 'I think I would be foolish not to write another novel,' he concluded.",,
260,"Hit and miss of mass marketing

AS ALMOST everyone knows, advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite.
Advertising's problems are more fundamental, and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are. That is the principal way in which advertising has gone astray.
Think about your own shopping habits. If you visit a supermarket you may leave with 30, 40 or perhaps 50 items listed on your check-out bill, the average number of items of all kinds purchased per visit of all kinds.
Many of these will not be advertised brands; some others will be multiple purchases of the same brand. At a maximum you will have bought a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands. 
Consumer durables? Perhaps a dozen a year. Cars? If yours is a new car, the statistical likelihood is that it is supplied by your employer.
If it isn't, you only buy one every three years. And though it may seem otherwise, you do not buy that many clothes either, and most of them will not be advertised brands.
Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. Compare that figure with the 32,500 branded goods and services that, according to Media Register, are advertised. Let's ignore the 23,000 which spend less than PS50,000 a year, and concentrate on the 9,500 brands that Media Register Individually lists and analyses.
Mr and Mrs Average have bought 400 of that 9,500, and not all because of their advertising. That's about 4 per cent. So you can forget that naive claim usually attributed to Lord Leverhulme: 'Half of my advertising is wasted but I've no way of knowing which half.' You could say that 96 per cent of all advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96 per cent.
When you're watching TV tonight, count how many of the commercials are for brands you buy or are likely to buy in the future. For most people the figure seems to be about one in 16 (6 per cent) so the commercials for the other 15 (94 per cent) are, on the face of it, wasted.
You probably think you're a special case, that you are impervious to advertising. Almost everyone thinks the same. But you aren't and they aren't. The truth is nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised.
Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. The notion that every reader of a publication or every viewer of a commercial break might immediately rush out and buy all or even many of the brands advertised is ludicrous. People register only a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest, so waste cannot be avoided. That does not mean advertising isn't cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.
Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority, because the advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments. Media advertising works, despite its much publicised expense, because it is a cheap means of mass communication.
Nonetheless, all waste is gruesome. With smart targeting the advertiser can minimise the wastage by increasing the percentage of readers or viewers who will respond; but he can never know precisely who will respond. Even the most accurate and finely tuned direct mail-shot never achieves a 100 per cent response. This is one of the fundamental differences between the use of media and face-to-face selling. It is possible, just, to envisage a salesman scoring with every prospective client he speaks to. The same could never happen when media are used. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly.
This is as true of Birth, Marriage and Death notices as it is of soft drink commercials. Any advertiser who can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population) is doing well. Of soap powder, the two top-selling brands in supermarkets would be delighted with a million extra customers. So that any advertising campaign, for any product (or any political party for that matter) which could win over 2 per cent of the population would be outstandingly successful: and that, as I began by saying, is but a tiny minority of the population.
The most cost-effective way to reach them may be the use of mass media, but if advertising is to get going again its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before.",C1,,,"The hit and miss of mass marketing

As most people know, advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic problems. Advertising started to go down in early 1989, before the economy got really bad.

The problems with advertising are more serious, and this is happening all over the world. The simple truth is that advertising has not changed as fast as the economy has.

Advertisers like to think about big markets and big media, but now there are many more brands and types of media. This means markets are split into smaller groups. Even ads for big brands should be made for smaller groups of people, but usually they are not. This is the main way advertising has gone wrong.

Think about how you shop. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or 50 things. This is about average for most people.

Many of these things will not be advertised brands. You might buy some of the same brands more than once. At most, you will buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 different products in the store. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands.

What about bigger items like washing machines? Maybe about twelve a year. Cars? If you have a new car, it might be from your job. If not, you probably buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most clothes are not advertised brands.

Even if you include sweets, medicines, tools, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands in a year. Now compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 that spend very little money, we can look at the 9,500 main brands.

An average person buys 400 of those 9,500 brands, and not all because of ads. That's about 4%. So the old saying, ""Half of my advertising is wasted, but I don't know which half,"" is not right. You could say 96% of advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96%.

When you watch TV tonight, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 ads (6%). So the other 15 ads (94%) seem to be wasted.

You might think you are special and that ads don't affect you. Almost everyone thinks this. But you are not special, and neither are they. The truth is, nobody buys most of the brands they see in ads.

Waste is a normal part of advertising. It's silly to think that everyone who sees an ad will go out and buy the product. People notice only a few ads and ignore the others, so waste cannot be avoided. But this doesn't mean advertising doesn't work. Many ads have shown that it does.

Advertising has to talk to many people to reach the right few, because advertisers don't know exactly who will buy their product. Media advertising works because it is a cheap way to talk to many people.

Still, all waste is bad. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who might buy. But they can never know exactly who will buy. Even the best direct mail never gets everyone to respond. This is a big difference between using media and selling face-to-face. A salesperson might sell to everyone they talk to, but this can't happen with media ads. If advertisers knew exactly who would buy, they wouldn't need to use media at all. They could talk to those people directly.

This is true for all types of advertising. Any advertiser who gets one million new customers (2% of adults) is doing very well. For example, the top soap brands would be very happy with one million extra customers. So any ad campaign that wins over 2% of people is very successful, and that is only a small part of the population.

Using mass media might be the best way to reach these people, but if advertising wants to improve, its messages will need to be aimed more carefully than ever before.",,,
261,"A history of the apple

Apples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size. But the late twentieth century is in danger of squandering its heritage.

Prehistoric wilding 8,000 BC

Human beings have been munching apples since prehistoric times. They spat out apple-pips in neolithic Britain. And 10,000 years ago they left apple remains to carbonise around their Swiss and Italian lakeside homes. In Switzerland and in the regions adjoining the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even appear to have dry-stored apple-halves for winter. But these were wild crab apples, tiny wizened fruit which, in Ancient Britain came to be known as 'windings'. They had little in common with the apples we know today.

Norman knowledge 1000 AD

From the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended.

Mediaeval favourites 1200

Several kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word 'costermonger' - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street. But prosperity declined as the country was hit by successive droughts, the Black Death and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced and more were imported. This went on until the sixteenth century when Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with a 'great store of grafts' including the famous Pippins, from which he grew the first ever modern-style orchard at Teynham in Kent.

Settler treasure 1750

By the seventeenth century apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who sailed to Canada, Australia, die US, South Africa and New Zealand took apples and apple-pips with them, counting these among their most treasured possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Settlement, took them to South Africa and the Pilgrim Fathers who boarded the Mayflower carried them to America. In North America the most famous apple-planter was john Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted seedling nurseries from Pennsylvania in the east through Ohio into Indiana in the west. The Indians regarded him as a medicine man and his apple-tree enthusiasm, odd clothing and religious devotion - he distributed religious tracts tom in pans for widespread circulation - stayed many folktales. He was said, for example, to be so kind to Gods creatures that he even slept with bears.

Modem Delicious 1850 

About this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer called Jesse Hiatt discovered something sprouting from the roots of a dead tree. The shoot grew into an apple tree bearing a totally new apple which Hiatt named 'Hawkey'. He sent it to a fruit show and on biting into one the judge exclaimed 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895 the apple was introduced to the trade as a 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

Granny Smith 1850

Another of the most famous modern apples was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of transported convicts, Maria was fiercely independent, rejecting both the criminal life of her parents and the bureaucratic hypocrisy of the colonial administration. She worked as a midwife in the small township of Eastwood in New South Wales, where she was known as 'Granny-Smith' because she took on responsibility for maintaining the farm and orchard, which was the family's main source of income. One day in 1868 she found a small tree pushing its way through a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and before long was harvesting the world's first major crop of green apples, soon to be famous all over the world. When asked how the tree came about she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish' - a comment which referred not only to the fruit but also her own convict origins.

Uniformity ales 1950

Apples are now grown all over the world from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to small luxury orchards throughout Africa. Most, though, are grown commercially and come from just half a dozen varieties - usually chosen for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. While amateur gardeners in the UK have kept many old apple varieties alive, the US has lost forever most of the apples it had 100 years ago.
But consumers are starting to demand more variety. We can't leave the responsibility of saving diversity in our apples - or any other food - up to the random selections of amateur gardeners. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all.",C1,,"A history of the apple

Apples have been with us for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we are in danger of losing this history.

**Prehistoric apples 8,000 BC**

People have been eating apples since ancient times. They left apple seeds in old British camps. They also left apple pieces near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. These early people even dried apple halves to eat in the winter. But these were small, wild crab apples. They were very different from the apples we eat now.

**Norman times 1000 AD**

The French learned from the Romans how to grow fruit well. They used this knowledge in their monasteries. They brought this skill, and some apple types, to Britain. But most Roman apples did not grow well in Britain. The Norman apples became more popular. British monks kept making new kinds of apples. Most of the apples we know today come from these.

**Popular apples in the 1200s**

A few kinds of apples became popular in Britain in the 1200s. The Old English Pearmain was a sweet apple people ate. The Costard was an apple used for cooking. It was sold in markets for a long time. But then, times became hard. There was little rain, a bad sickness, and wars. People grew fewer apples and bought more from other countries. This changed when King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn about apples. The man came back with new apple trees and started the first big apple farm in Kent.

**Apples travel the world 1750**

By the 1600s, apples were very popular in Britain. When people sailed to new countries like Canada, Australia, and America, they took apple seeds with them. These seeds were very important to them. A famous man in America, Johnny Appleseed, planted apple trees in many places. People told stories about him because he was very kind and loved apple trees.

**The Delicious apple 1850**

Around this time, a farmer in Iowa named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing. The tree made a new kind of apple. He called it 'Hawkey'. He took it to a fruit show. A judge tasted it and said, ""Delicious!"" The apple was later sold as 'Delicious' and became one of the most popular apples in the world.

**The Granny Smith apple 1850**

Another famous apple was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. People called her 'Granny Smith'. She found a small tree growing in some old fruit. She moved the tree and it grew green apples. These apples later became famous all over the world. She said that it was like God making something good from rubbish.

**Apples today 1950**

Today, apples are grown all over the world. But most apples we buy in shops come from only a few types. They are often chosen because they look red or are easy to transport, not because they taste the best. This means we are losing many different kinds of apples. People in their gardens have saved some old types, but many have been lost forever.

Now, people are starting to want more variety. We cannot let only gardeners save different apples. We must all work to protect the many different types of apples for everyone.","A History of the Apple

Apples have existed for thousands of years, and they come in many colours, shapes, and sizes. However, in recent times, we are at risk of losing this important heritage.

**Prehistoric Wild Apples (around 8,000 BC)**

People have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, they left apple seeds behind. About 10,000 years ago, people living near lakes in Switzerland and Italy left apple remains that turned into charcoal. In these regions, they even dried and stored halves of apples for the winter. But these were small, wild crab apples, which were very different from modern apples.

**Apples in Norman Times (around 1000 AD)**

The French learned fruit-growing skills from the Romans, especially in monasteries. This knowledge, including how to make cider, was brought to Britain. Most Roman apple varieties did not grow well in the British climate, so the types from France became more common. British monks continued to experiment and develop new kinds of apples. Most Western apples today come from these varieties.

In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204, was named for its pear-like shape and was the main eating apple for centuries. The main cooking apple was the Costard, sold in markets for about 400 years. The word ""costermonger,"" meaning a street seller of fruit and vegetables, comes from this apple. Later, because of problems like droughts, the Black Death, and wars, fewer apples were grown in Britain and more were imported. This changed when King Henry VIII sent his fruiterer to France to learn about apple growing. He returned with new apple trees and created the first modern orchard in Kent.

**Apples Travel the World (around 1750)**

By the 17th century, apples were very popular in Britain. When the first settlers sailed to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apple seeds with them as valuable possessions. Famous explorers like Captain Bligh brought apples to Australia. In North America, the most famous apple planter was Johnny Appleseed. He planted apple trees across a large area, and many stories were told about his unusual life and kindness.

Today, apples are grown all over the world. However, most apples sold in shops come from just a few varieties. They are often chosen for their red colour or because they travel well, not for their taste. As a result, apples are becoming more similar, and we are losing many different types. In the UK, gardeners have saved many old varieties, but in the US, most apples from 100 years ago have disappeared.

**Loss of Variety – 1950**

Apples are now grown all over the world, but most are produced commercially from just a few varieties.

While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many traditional types, the United States has lost the majority of the apple varieties it had a century ago.

262,"Vancouver

In the last ten years or so, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver, in western Canada. To relax in the evening, residents stroll down the city streets and, if you join them, you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. People come to Vancouver for its mild climate, its wonderful setting between the ocean and the mountains, its clean and safe environment and its educational and job opportunities. And much as some may grumble about the speed at which new buildings have sprung up, there's no doubt that the new arrivals and flourishing tourism industry have helped fuel an urban renaissance. Locals once referred to Vancouver as 'Terminal City' because of the city's role as a terminus or gateway to all other places. Though the name has fallen slightly out of favour, Vancouver is more a gateway than ever.

Putting Pen to Paper

Journalists like myself are usually poor letter-writers. I have heard it said that this is because of the instinctive distaste we feel at writing something we are not going to be paid for, but I cannot believe we have quite such mercenary characters. It is more probably that since in our work, we are always striving to get the greatest possible effect, the essential spontaneity of a letter escapes us. The real creative artist, who does not consciously work on the effect at all (though he may rewrite a passage dozens of times), does not have this problem. I believe that it is in this inherent grasp of the effect of his words that there lies the only sure test of the real artist. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines he surely never thought consciously that it was the contrast between polysyllables that made them so effective, as well as showing him to be a great writer.

Supermarket Opening

The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely on a soap star, a disc jockey or a minor member of the royal family to come down and cut the ribbon. Now it seems that new branches are popping up every day in many areas and so the poor old celebrity has become superfluous. Why pay a famous person when any Tom, Dick or Harry will open it for nothing? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new branch of Superbuy, so long as they were at the front. According to one prospective customer who knew someone who worked there, the first five men over the threshold would be getting a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This snippet of information quickly swept through the crowd, instilling feelings of smug superiority among those at the front, and envy from the latecomers.

In the last ten years, many thousands of people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evening, people walk along the city streets. If you walk with them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because the weather is mild. It is between the ocean and the mountains. It is clean and safe. It also has good schools and jobs. Some people do not like how fast new buildings are built. But the new people and the many tourists help the city grow. People once called Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was the end of the train line and a gateway to other places. This name is less popular now, but Vancouver is still a gateway to the world.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are often bad at writing letters. Some people say this is because we do not like to write for free. But I do not think we are that selfish. It is probably because in our jobs, we always try to write for a big effect. So we forget how to write a simple, natural letter. A real artist does not have this problem. They do not think too much about the effect of their words. I think a real artist knows how their words will make people feel. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about why they were good. He just wrote them.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a special day. Often, a TV star, a radio host, or someone from the royal family would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day in many towns. So, famous people are not needed anymore. Why pay a famous person when any normal person will open it for free? Last week, a new Superbuy store opened. The older people waiting outside did not care who opened it. They just wanted to be at the front of the line. One person in the crowd knew someone who worked there. This person said the first five men inside would get a bottle of aftershave. The first five women would get flowers. This news moved quickly through the crowd. The people at the front felt very pleased. The people at the back felt jealous.","**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many thousands of people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evening, people walk along the city streets. If you walk with them, you will probably hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because the weather is mild, the city is between the ocean and the mountains, it is clean and safe, and there are good schools and jobs. Some people complain about how fast new buildings are built, but the new people and the busy tourism have helped make the city better. In the past, people called Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was the last stop or a door to other places. That name is less popular now, but Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever before.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are usually not good at writing letters. Some people say this is because we don't like to write without getting paid, but I don't think we are that selfish. It is more likely that in our jobs, we always try to write for a big effect, so we lose the natural feeling a letter should have. A real artist does not think so much about the effect (even if they rewrite something many times), so they don't have this problem. I believe that knowing the effect of your words is the best way to know if someone is a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous words, he probably never thought about why they were so good or that they showed he was a great writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be something special. Often, a TV star, a radio host, or someone from the royal family would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day in many places, so famous people are not needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, older people waiting for the new Superbuy store didn't care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. Someone in the crowd said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly. People at the front felt very pleased, and the people who came late felt jealous.",,,
263,"Philadelphia Avenue

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, the humidity thickened into a palpable, prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness; our neighbours the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the Kring's and the Pottses' houses where my first playmates, all girls, lived. These houses down the street, though not every inhabitant was known by name to me, had each been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street, and which punctuated my progress on roller skates or on my scooter. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well: the porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes: wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron, in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. Throughout Shillington, not only had houses I remembered as homes become stores but, stranger still, stores - Pep Conrad's up on Franklin and Second, Han Kieffer's here - had reverted to being homes. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert's flat is a former curtain warehouse. It has the conventional features of the classic loft space, in this instance, exposed brickwork and gigantic doors, through which curtains were once hoisted from trains on the adjacent railway track. But Gilbert was adamant that he didn't want a brutally empty, open-plan space - for practical as much as aesthetic reasons.
'In my last place, living and working spaces were integrated. It was hard to switch off or start work in full view of the living area.'
Refusing to conform to the loft-dwelling convention of open-plan living, he broke up the space near the entrance with a giant snaking sheet of corrugated plastic. 'It hides the office, creates a hallway, and guides the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral zone, where I can either cook dinner for friends or make coffee for clients.'
To offset the synthetic look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert laid the floors with a light wood. And while his futuristic chairs and sofas litter the flat, its also stuffed with rather more sentimental and homely furniture, given to him by his parents or bought from markets.

Bruce Chatwin

To escape or to explore? The spur behind Bice Chatwin's absurdly romantic nomadic existence has become something of a literary conundrum. Chatwin's life and art were strewn with secrets, subtle resonances and, it must be said, lies. But he was, for all that, a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, In Patagonia, published in 1977, is an awesome exercise in imagination. A travel book that reinvented travel writing, it has the animation of a thriller, the sparkle of romantic fiction and the irrepressible insight of truly extraordinary literature. Of course, even with this book, Chatwin cloaked fact with concoction; when sketching individuals and incidents, he would adjust, if not abandon, objective reality for the sake of a better twist to an anecdote, or a clean cut to the heart of what the book somehow seemed to suggest - that through travel it was possible to discover whole histories that had been lived out as if solely to excite and fascinate future explorers.

Swimming

The warm rain tumbled from the gutter in one of those midsummer downpours as I hastened across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. Breaststroking up and down, I nosed along, eyes just at water level. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm intensified, drowning birdsong, and a haze rose off the water as though the pool itself were rising to meet the lowering sky.
It was at the height of this drenching in the summer of 1996 that the notion of a long swim through Britain began to form itself. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage.
Most of us live in a world where more and more places and things are signposted, labelled, and officially 'interpreted'. There is something about all this that is tuning the reality of things into visual reality. It is the reason why walking, cycling and swimming will always be subversive activities. They allow us to regain a sense of what is old and wild, by getting off the beaten track and breaking free of the official version of things. A swimming journey would give me access to that pan of our world which, like darkness, misty woods or high mountains, still retains most mystery.",C2,,,"I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with the odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air felt wet and heavy with a light rain. This made me feel hidden as I walked. I have known this side of the street since I was a small child. I remember our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses where my first friends, who were all girls, lived. Even the houses where I didn't know the people were special to me. I remember the small paths in the cement where water ran from the roofs to the street. I used to skate over them. As the street went downhill, the houses became smaller and the gardens got very small. Over time, things changed. Wooden parts of the porches were replaced with iron ones. In my town, some houses became shops, and some shops, like Han Kieffer's, became houses again. I wonder how the people live in those old shop spaces with the smells of things that were once sold there.

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert lives in an old curtain warehouse. It has the usual things you find in a loft, like old brick walls and very big doors. Curtains used to be brought in through these doors from trains on the nearby railway. But Rick did not want one big, empty room. He had a good reason for this.
'In my last home, my living space and my work space were together. It was difficult to stop working or to start working when I could see my living room from my desk.'
He did not want an open-plan space like many lofts. So, near the entrance, he put up a big, curved wall made of plastic. 'It hides my office, makes a hallway, and makes you look towards the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a place where I can cook for friends or make coffee for people I work with.'
To make the plastic wall and his metal kitchen look warmer, he used light wood for the floors. His flat has modern chairs and sofas, but it also has older, more personal furniture from his parents or from markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Did he travel to escape or to explore? The reason for Bruce Chatwin's romantic life of travel is a question people like to talk about. Chatwin's life and his writing were full of secrets and small connections, and also some lies. But he was a very good and special writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, came out in 1977. It is a wonderful book that changed travel writing. It is as exciting as a thriller, as charming as a love story, and full of great ideas. Of course, in this book, Chatwin did not always tell the complete truth. When he wrote about people and events, he sometimes changed the facts to make a better story or to get to the main point. His book seems to say that by traveling, you can find whole histories that feel as if they happened just to interest future travelers.

**Swimming**

The warm rain was falling hard from the gutter on a summer day. I ran across the grass behind my house and hid in the swimming pool. I swam up and down, with my eyes at the level of the water. Each raindrop hit the water and made a small fountain that turned into a bubble and then disappeared. The best part was when the rain became very heavy. The sound of the rain was louder than the birds, and a mist came off the water. It looked like the pool was rising to meet the dark sky.
It was during this heavy rain in the summer of 1996 that I first thought about a long swim across Britain. I wanted to follow the water as it traveled over the land to the sea. I wanted to stop swimming in a pool, always turning at the wall, like an animal walking in a cage.
Today, more and more places and things have signs and explanations. This can make real things feel like just pictures. This is why walking, cycling, and swimming can feel like small acts of freedom. They let us find a feeling for what is old and natural. We can leave the popular paths and escape the official story of things. A long swim would let me reach a part of our world that, like the dark, foggy woods, or high mountains, is still full of mystery.","I walked along Philadelphia Avenue on the side with the odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air was heavy with a light rain that made me feel hidden as I walked. I had known this side of the street since I was very young. I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of the Krings and the Pottses, where my first friends—all girls—lived. Even the houses where I didn't know everyone's name felt special to me as a child, just like the small channels in the pavement that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. These channels marked my path when I roller-skated or rode my scooter. As the street went downhill, the neighborhood became a little less wealthy: the porches were closer to the ground, and the front yards grew smaller. Over time, things had changed. Wooden porch railings and posts had been replaced with wrought iron in a style that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had become shops, and strangely, some shops—like Pep Conrad's on Franklin and Second Street, and Han Kieffer's here—had turned back into homes. I wondered how the people living there arranged those large, open spaces with shelves. How did they deal with the faint smells of the products that used to be sold there?

Of course, even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction. When describing people and events, he would change the truth to make a story more interesting or to get straight to the point—that through travel, it is possible to discover entire histories that seem to have happened just to amaze future explorers.

**Swimming**

Warm rain was pouring down in one of those heavy summer storms as I hurried across the lawn behind my house and found shelter in the swimming pool. Swimming up and down using breaststroke, I moved with my eyes just at the water's surface. Every raindrop hit the water and burst into a short fountain, which then turned into a bubble and popped. The best part was when the storm grew stronger, silencing the birds, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool was lifting to meet the dark sky. It was during this heavy rain in the summer of 1996 that I first thought about taking a long swim across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, to escape the boredom of always swimming back and forth in a pool, like a tiger walking in a cage. Most of us live in a world where more and more places and things have signs, labels, and official explanations. This tends to turn real life into just something to look at. That is why walking, cycling, and swimming will always be rebellious activities.

A swimming journey would let me experience that part of our world which, like darkness, foggy forests, or high mountains, still holds the most mystery.","I made my way along Philadelphia Avenue on the side with the odd-numbered houses. The evening had grown darker, and the humidity had intensified into a tangible, misty drizzle, which gave my walk a heightened sense of covert movement.

Over time, changes had occurred: wooden porch railings and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. Throughout Shillington, not only had houses I recalled as family homes been converted into shops, but, more surprisingly, shops—such as Pep Conrad’s at Franklin and Second, and Han Kieffer’s here—had reverted to being private residences. How had the occupants partitioned those open, shelved interiors? How did they coexist with the lingering scents of former merchandise?

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert’s apartment was once a curtain warehouse. It retains the typical characteristics of a classic loft, including exposed brick walls and enormous doors through which curtains were once hoisted from trains on the nearby railway line. However, Gilbert was determined to avoid a stark, open-plan layout—for both practical and aesthetic reasons.  
“In my previous home, my living and working areas were combined. It was difficult to relax or begin working when the living area was constantly in view.”  
Rejecting the conventional open-plan style associated with loft living, he divided the space near the entrance with a large, curved sheet of corrugated plastic. “It conceals the office, forms an entrance hall, and directs attention toward the kitchen in the centre of the apartment. I intended the kitchen to serve as a neutral area, where I could either prepare dinner for friends or make coffee for clients.”  
To counterbalance the synthetic appearance of the plastic screen and the stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert installed light wood flooring. And although his futuristic chairs and sofas are scattered throughout the flat, it is also filled with more sentimental, homely pieces, either given to him by his parents or purchased at markets.

Bruce Chatwin

Was he escaping or exploring? The motivation behind Bruce Chatwin’s extraordinarily romantic nomadic lifestyle has become something of a literary puzzle. Chatwin’s life and work were filled with secrets, subtle echoes and, it must be acknowledged, falsehoods. Nevertheless, he was an exceptionally gifted and original writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, is a remarkable feat of imagination. A travel book that transformed the genre, it combines the pace of a thriller, the allure of romantic fiction, and the irrepressible insight of truly exceptional literature. Admittedly, even in this work, Chatwin blended fact with invention; when depicting people and events, he would modify, if not completely disregard, objective reality to enhance an anecdote or to capture the essence of what the book seemed to imply—that through travel, one could uncover entire histories that appeared to have unfolded solely to captivate future explorers.

Warm rain poured from the gutter in a characteristic midsummer downpour as I hurried across the lawn behind my house and took refuge in the swimming pool. Swimming breaststroke up and down, I moved slowly with my eyes just at water level. Each raindrop burst into a brief, bouncing fountain that became a bubble and then vanished. The most remarkable moments came when the storm grew more intense, silencing the birdsong, and a mist rose from the water as if the pool itself were ascending to meet the overcast sky.  
It was during this heavy rainfall in the summer of 1996 that the idea of undertaking a long-distance swim across Britain began to take shape. I wanted to trace the path of the rain as it wandered across the country to return to the sea, to escape the monotony of a life spent swimming lengths, forever turning back on myself like a caged tiger.  
Most of us inhabit a world in which an increasing number of places and objects are signposted, labelled, and provided with official interpretations. There is something about this trend that transforms actual reality into a visual representation. This is precisely why activities such as walking, cycling, and swimming will always retain a subversive quality. They enable us to rediscover a sense of the ancient and untamed by leaving the well-trodden path and rejecting the authorised narrative. A journey by swimming would grant me entry into that part of our world which, like darkness, misty forests, or high peaks, still holds the greatest mystery.",
264,"Online Literary Criticism For All

Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?

From the outset, the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice, however, a certain amount of technical know-how was required, at least in the early years.
However, there was at least one field, previously restricted to the few, that was genuinely opened up to the masses. By visiting the pages of Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, anyone was able to try their hand at literary criticism.
Amazon's egalitarian approach to book reviews -- namely, that anyone could say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars - looked, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and whenever a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically.
This meant that Amazon got to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers of a book could see what other readers thought of it, for better or worse, rather than reading just the blurb from the publisher and the views of professional critics.
Other online bookstores which also operated as large bricks-and-mortar bookshop chains provided similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted by far the greatest number of reviews and, accordingly, encountered the most funny business.
For this critical free-for-all lent itself to subversion of various subtle and not-so-subtle kinds. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day - Amazon would not say exactly how many - so it was impractical to vet them all. Instead, a team of editors scoured the site, checking that reviews conformed to the company's guidelines.
Single-word reviews, for instance, or personal attacks on the author, were not allowed. Nor were reviews that contained obscenities, gave away the ending, or referred to other reviews. Ultimately, however, the reviewers were anonymous (they were not required to give their real names) and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon checkers noticed them. So there was plenty of scope for mischief.
For example, there was nothing to stop writers giving their own books glowing reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was so mortified by the bad reviews that readers gave his first novel ('infantile trash', 'puerile pap') that he submitted several anonymous ones of his own ('hilarious', 'fabulous') to redress the balance. His ruse succeeded until he wrote an article detailing his deception. The fake reviews were promptly removed. 
Authors were, in fact, provided with their own way to hold forth: by clicking on a link marked 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors who used this feature posted jolly messages expressing their desire that browsers would buy, and enjoy, the book in question. A few even gave their email addresses, thus inviting readers to communicate directly. Yet authors who posted messages knew that while Amazon did vet them, it did not check that they really came from the author.
An exception to this was made in the case of big names. A little-known writer submitted an authors comment, purporting to be from John Updike, in which he admitted to being a 'talented but ultimately over-hyped middlebrow author'. Unsurprisingly, it was deemed a fake and was removed.
Still, the fur really began to fly as a result of postings from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's We've Got Spirit, which documented a year in the life of a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well received by the mainstream press. But many of the people mentioned in it felt betrayed, and the books page on Amazon was an obvious outlet for their anger. Dozens of highly critical reviews were submitted - only to vanish a few days later.
Despite this episode, as far as Amazon was concerned, the fact that so many people were prepared to invest so much time reading and writing reviews was simply good for business. As readers' reviews were supposed to be a 'forum to talk about a book' rather than a chat room, a particularly close eye was kept on bestselling books, to ensure that all reviews played by the rules.
This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page devoted to a less well-known book. The Story about Ping, a classic children's work that tells the story of a duck called Ping, was the inspiration for much geek humour, because 'ping' also happened to be the name of a software utility used to measure the degree of congestion on the Internet. One lengthy review constructed an elaborate analogy between the books plot and the architecture of the Internet, and concluded that the book provided a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts.
Such silliness was, however, the exception rather than the rule. The striking thing about the vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com was how seriously their contributors took them. And overall the reviews collectively provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying.
The writer George Orwell once complained that 'reviewing too many books involved constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever'. All the more reason, then, to regard the democratisation of the process as a good thing.",C2,,"Online Book Reviews For Everyone

Do-it-yourself book reviews: more than just fun?

The internet was for everyone. At first, you needed to know about computers to use it. But one thing became easy for many people. On Amazon.com, the first big online bookshop, anyone could write a book review.

Amazon's idea was simple. Anyone could write a review and give a book up to five stars. It seemed like a good idea. Every book had its own page on the website. When someone wrote a new review, it appeared on the page right away.

This was good for Amazon. They got many free reviews. People who wanted to buy a book could see what other readers thought. They did not have to only read the words from the book company.

Other bookshops did the same thing. But Amazon was the biggest. It had the most customers and the most reviews. It also had the most problems.

This free system was easy to use in a bad way. Thousands of reviews were written every day. Amazon could not check them all. A small team looked at the reviews to make sure they followed the rules.

For example, you could not write a review with only one word. You could not be unkind to the writer. You could not use bad words or tell the story's ending. But the reviewers did not use their real names. A bad review was only removed if Amazon saw it. So, people could cause problems.

For example, nothing stopped writers from writing very good reviews for their own books. One writer, Lev Grossman, was sad about the bad reviews for his first book. So, he wrote some good reviews for it without using his name. His plan worked until he wrote an article and told everyone what he did. Then, the fake reviews were removed.

Writers could also write on their own book's page. They could click a link that said, ""I am the Writer."" Most writers wrote happy messages. They hoped people would buy and like their book. Some even gave their email address. But Amazon did not check if the message was really from the writer.

This was different for famous writers. One not-famous writer wrote a message saying he was the famous writer John Updike. In the message, he said he was not a very good writer. People knew it was fake, and it was removed.

The biggest problems came from readers, not writers. A book by James McElroy was about a cheerleading team. Newspapers liked the book, but many people in the book were angry. They wrote many bad reviews for it on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days.

For Amazon, it was good that so many people spent time reading and writing reviews. Reviews were a place to talk about a book. The company watched the pages for popular books carefully to make sure the reviews followed the rules.

This meant the best place to write a funny review was for a book that was not famous. A children's book about a duck called Ping was used for many jokes. This is because ""ping"" is also the name of a computer tool. One long, funny review said the book was a good way to learn about computers.

But most reviews were not funny. The important thing was that most people took their reviews very seriously. In general, all the reviews together gave a very good idea if a book was worth buying.

The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant you had to pretend to have feelings about them. This is a good reason to think that letting everyone write reviews is a good thing.","Online Literary Criticism For Everyone

Other online bookshops also had this feature. But as the biggest company, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon had the most customers and the most reviews. It also had the most problems.

This open system was easy to misuse. Thousands of reviews were written every day, so Amazon couldn't check them all. Instead, a team looked at the website to make sure reviews followed the rules.

For example, reviews couldn't be just one word, or attack the author personally. They also couldn't use bad language, give away the ending, or talk about other reviews. Reviewers didn't have to use their real names, and bad reviews were only removed if Amazon noticed them. This meant people could cause trouble if they wanted to.

For example, nothing stopped writers from writing good reviews of their own books. One writer, Lev Grossman, was upset by bad reviews of his first novel. So he wrote several anonymous good reviews of his own book. This worked until he wrote an article explaining what he did. Then the fake reviews were removed.

Authors actually had their own special way to comment on their books. Most authors who used this wrote happy messages hoping people would buy and enjoy their book. Some even shared their email addresses. But Amazon didn't check if these messages really came from the author.

Only famous authors were treated differently. One little-known writer pretended to be the famous author John Updike and wrote a negative comment about Updike's work. This fake comment was quickly removed.

The biggest problems actually came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, newspapers liked it. But many people in the book felt angry about how they were shown. They wrote many bad reviews on Amazon's website, but these disappeared after a few days.

Despite these problems, Amazon was happy that so many people spent time reading and writing reviews. This was good for business. Because reviews were meant to be about books, not general chat, Amazon watched popular books carefully to make sure reviews followed the rules.

This meant the best place to write a silly review was for a less popular book. One children's book about a duck called Ping inspired many funny reviews because ""ping"" is also the name of an internet tool. One long review joked that the book explained internet ideas well.

However, most reviews were serious, not silly. What was interesting was how seriously most people took their reviews. Overall, the reviews together gave a good idea about whether something was worth buying.

The writer George Orwell once said that professional reviewers often have to pretend to have opinions about books they don't care about. This is a good reason why letting everyone review books is a positive change.","Online Literary Criticism For Everyone

From the beginning, the Internet was designed to be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their writing or share music online. However, in the early days, you needed some technical skill to do this.

But one area that really became open to ordinary people was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing a book review.

Amazon's system for reviews was very democratic: anyone could share their opinion and give a book a rating out of five stars. At first, this seemed like a perfect idea. Every book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a review, it appeared there immediately.

Other online bookstores that were part of large physical chains had similar features. But Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of online sales. Because it had the most customers, it received the most reviews and also had the most unusual problems.

This open system was open to misuse. Thousands of reviews were posted every day—Amazon wouldn't say exactly how many—so it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors looked through the site to make sure reviews followed the company's rules.

For example, reviews with just one word, personal attacks on the author, bad language, spoilers, or comments about other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous and didn't have to use their real names. Problematic reviews were only taken down if Amazon's team found them. This meant there was a lot of opportunity for people to cause trouble.

For instance, authors could write very positive reviews for their own books. Author Lev Grossman was so upset by the bad reviews for his first novel that he posted several anonymous positive ones to improve its rating. His plan worked until he wrote an article admitting what he had done. The fake reviews were then quickly removed.

Authors did have a special way to comment officially. They could click a link that said, 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors who did this posted friendly messages hoping people would buy and like their book. Some even shared their email addresses to talk directly with readers. However, while Amazon checked these messages, it did not confirm if they were really from the author.

An exception was made for very famous writers. Once, an unknown writer posted a comment pretending to be the famous author John Updike, where 'Updike' called himself a ""talented but overrated author."" Not surprisingly, it was found to be fake and removed.

However, the biggest problems usually came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a year with a small-town cheerleading team was published, professional critics liked it. But many people who were in the book felt betrayed, and they used Amazon's page to show their anger. Many very critical reviews appeared, but they were taken down after a few days.

Despite these issues, Amazon believed that having so many people reading and writing reviews was good for business. Reader reviews were meant to be a ""place to talk about a book,"" not a casual chat room. Special attention was given to popular books to make sure all reviews followed the rules.

Because of this, the best place to post a funny review was on the page of a less popular book. The children's book *The Story about Ping*, about a duck named Ping, became popular for jokes among technology fans. This is because 'ping' is also the name of a tool used to test Internet connections. One long review made a detailed comparison between the book's story and how the Internet works, saying the book gave a ""good basic overview"" of computer networks.

Still, this kind of humor was not common. What was impressive about most Amazon reviews was how seriously people took them. Overall, all the reviews together gave a very good idea of whether a product was worth buying.

The writer George Orwell once said that professional reviewers often had to invent opinions about books they didn't really care about. This is a good reason to think that letting everyone join the review process is a positive change.",,

Over the past one and a half centuries, photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the medium has expanded its capabilities in the recording of time and space, thus allowing human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment or to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. It has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. Indeed, the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
Nonetheless, the recording of events by means of the visual image has a much longer history. The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. And although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of the early cave paintings - whether they record the 'actual' events of hunting, whether they functioned as sympathetic magic to encourage the increase of animals for hunting, whether they had a role as religious icons, or if they were made simply to enliven and brighten domestic activities - pictorial images seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it.
Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society. The popular notion that 'seeing is believing' had always afforded special status to the visual image. So when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense.
In the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of photography appeared to offer the promise of 'automatically' providing a truthful visual record. It was seen not only as the culmination of Western visual representation but, quite simply, the camera, functioning in much the same way as the human eye, was regarded as a machine which could provide a fixed image. And this image was considered to be a very close approximation to that which we actually see. The chemical fixing of the image enabled the capture of what might be considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, the photographic image was held to be an achievement of sophisticated culture and produced the type of image that artists had struggled throughout the centuries to acquire the manual, visual and conceptual skills to create.
It may seem a further irony that, because of the cameras perceived realism in its ability to replicate visual perception, it was assumed that all peoples would 'naturally' be able to understand photographs. This gave rise to the question of whether photography constituted a 'universal language'. For example, in 1933 this view had been expressed in a series of radio broadcasts by photographer August Sander: 'Even the most isolated Bushman could understand a photograph of the heavens -- whether it showed the sun and moon or the constellations.' However, in the face of the rapid increase in global communications which characterised the latter part of the twentieth century, we do at least need to ask to what extent the photographic image can penetrate through cultural differences in understanding. Or is photography as bound by cultural conventions as any other form of communication, such as language?
Is it possible that our familiarity with the photographic image has bred our current contempt for the intricacies and subtle methods that characterise the medium's ability to transmit its vivid impressions of 'reality'? Photography is regarded quite naturally as offering such convincing forms of pictorial evidence that this process of communication often seems to render the medium totally transparent, blurring the distinction between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations. It is the most natural thing in the world for someone to open their wallet and produce a photograph saying 'this is my grandson'.
Ever since its invention in 1839, the technology of photography and the attitudes towards the medium by its practitioners have changed radically. This may partly be attributed to photography gradually moving into what might be termed 'mythic time' - its initial role as a nineteenth-century record-keeper has now moved beyond the human scale and photographic images, once immediate and close to photographer and subject alike, have now passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document, one which often reveals as much (if not more) about the individuals and society which produced the image as it does about its subject.
I hope to show that the camera is not merely a mute, passive chronicler of events, and that photography does not just passively reflect culture, but can provide the vision and impetus that promote social and political change and development. For example, it is difficult to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century without recognising the central role of the development of perspective in bringing about new visual means of representation. Similarly, photography has made a major contribution to the bringing about of the media culture that characterises our own era, while at the same time it has assumed the ironic role of bringing the harsh realities of the world to the coffee-table.",C2,"Photography

People use cameras to take pictures. They take pictures of life. They take pictures of people. They take pictures of places. Pictures can show big things. Pictures can show small things. Pictures can show things far away. Pictures can show things from long ago. Pictures are important. They tell us about people.

But people made pictures before cameras. Long ago, people made pictures in caves. We do not know why. Maybe for hunting. Maybe for magic. Maybe for religion. Pictures are part of human life.

People think: if you see a picture, you believe it. So the camera was very important.

In the 1800s, people made the camera. They thought the camera shows the truth. The camera works like an eye. It makes a picture that stays. The picture looks like what we see. Artists tried to make pictures like this for a long time.

People thought everyone understands a photo. They thought photos are for all people. For example, a person in the desert can understand a picture of the sky. But can all people understand the same photo? Or is a photo like a language? Do you need to learn it?

We see many photos. Maybe we do not see they are special. We think photos show the real world. For example, a person can show a photo and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Cameras changed a lot since 1839. People use cameras in new ways. Old photos are now history. They tell us about the past.

The camera is not only a machine. Photos do not only show life. Photos can help change the world. For example, new pictures helped change art long ago. Photos help make our media world. They show us hard things about the world.",,"Photography

For about 150 years, photography has been used to record all parts of human life. In this short time, it has improved a lot. It can now show very fast moments and very large or very small things. It brings us pictures from faraway places on Earth, from space, and from difficult situations in society. Photography has become one of the most important ways to show what it means to be human.

But people have been recording events with pictures for much longer. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago. We don't know exactly why early humans made cave paintings. Maybe they showed real hunting events, or maybe they were used for magic or religion. Whatever the reason, pictures have always been an important part of human culture.

People have often asked if pictures show the truth. We often say ""seeing is believing,"" so we usually trust what we see. When photography was invented, it had a very big effect on society and culture.

In the 1800s, people thought photography could show the truth automatically. They saw it as the best way to make pictures. The camera works a bit like the human eye, so people believed it could make a true image of what we see. At the same time, photography was seen as a great cultural achievement. It could make the kind of pictures that artists had tried to make for centuries.

Because photos look so real, people thought everyone in the world would understand them. Some people asked if photography was a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, a photographer said that even a person who lived far from modern life could understand a photo of the sky. But today, with so much communication between countries, we need to ask: can photos be understood by everyone? Or do we need to know about a culture to understand its photos?

Maybe because we see so many photos now, we don't always notice the skill needed to make them. Photos often seem to show the truth so well that we forget they are just pictures. For example, when someone shows a photo and says ""this is my grandson,"" it feels completely natural.

Since it began in 1839, photography has changed a lot. The technology is different, and photographers think about it in new ways. Photos were first used to record life in the 1800s. Now, many old photos are from times no one alive can remember. Over time, photos change from personal memories into historical documents. They can tell us as much about the people and society that made them as about the things in the picture.

I want to show that the camera is not just a simple recorder of events. Photography does not only show culture—it can also help create social and political change. For example, new ways of drawing pictures were very important for the big cultural changes in Italy in the 1400s. In the same way, photography has helped create our modern media culture. It also has the interesting job of showing the difficult truths of the world to people in their everyday lives.","Photography

For the last 150 years, photography has recorded all parts of human life and activity. In this short history, it has improved its ability to record time and space. This lets people see a quick moment or imagine both very large and very small things. It has shown us pictures from faraway places on Earth, distant parts of our solar system, and the social problems of modern life. In fact, photography has become one of the most important ways to express the human experience.

However, recording events with images has a much longer history. The first examples of picture-making go back about 35,000 years to the Upper Palaeolithic period. We don't know exactly why early humans made cave paintings. Maybe they recorded real hunting events, maybe they were used for magic to help hunting, maybe they had a religious purpose, or maybe they were just to make daily life more interesting. Whatever the reason, pictures have always been connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have asked how accurate images really are and what their place in society should be. The common idea that ""seeing is believing"" has always given images a special position. So when photography was invented, its effect on society and culture was huge.

In the mid-nineteenth century, photography seemed to promise a true visual record made automatically. It was seen not only as the highest point of Western picture-making, but people believed the camera worked like the human eye and could produce a fixed image. This image was thought to be very close to what we actually see. The chemical process of fixing the image allowed the capture of what seemed like a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, the photographic image was considered an achievement of advanced culture and created the kind of image that artists had worked for centuries to learn how to make.

Interestingly, because people thought photography copied reality so well, they assumed everyone would naturally understand photographs. This led to the question of whether photography was a ""universal language."" For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said in radio broadcasts: ""Even the most isolated Bushman could understand a photograph of the sky—whether it showed the sun and moon or the stars."" However, with the fast growth of global communications in the late twentieth century, we need to ask how well photographic images can cross cultural differences. Or is photography limited by cultural rules, just like language?

Could it be that because we are so familiar with photographs, we no longer appreciate the complex ways they can show ""reality""? Photography is naturally seen as providing such believable picture evidence that we often forget about the medium itself. The difference between what we see in real life and what we see in photographs becomes unclear. It seems completely normal for someone to take a photo from their wallet and say ""this is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, both photography technology and how photographers view it have changed a lot. This is partly because photography has entered what we might call ""mythic time""—its original role as a nineteenth-century way of keeping records has grown beyond human scale. Photographic images that were once immediate and close to both photographer and subject are now beyond living memory. Over time, photographs have changed from memory aids to historical documents. These documents often tell us as much about the people and society that created them as about their subjects.

I hope to show that the camera is not just a silent, passive recorder of events, and that photography doesn't only reflect culture. It can also provide the vision and motivation that lead to social and political change. For example, it's hard to imagine the cultural changes of the fifteenth-century Italian Renaissance without understanding the important role of perspective in creating new visual ways of representation. Similarly, photography has greatly helped create the media culture that defines our own time, while also playing the interesting role of bringing the difficult realities of the world into our homes.","Over the past 150 years, photography has recorded every aspect of human life and activity.

It has provided images from distant parts of the world, faraway areas of the solar system, and the complex social issues and crises of modern life. Indeed, photography has become one of the most important and powerful ways of expressing the human experience.

However, recording events through pictures has a much longer history. The earliest examples of picture-making go back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. Although we cannot be certain why early cave paintings were made – whether they recorded real hunting events, acted as magic to help increase animal numbers, served as religious symbols, or simply made daily life more interesting – visual images seem to be deeply connected to human culture as we know it.

Throughout the history of visual representation, people have questioned how accurate images really are and what status they hold in society. The common saying that 'seeing is believing' has always given special importance to visual images. So when photography was invented, its effect on society and culture was enormous.

Our familiarity with photographic images may have made us overlook the complex and subtle ways the medium communicates vivid impressions of 'reality'.

Caves

Research establishments and university departments around the world have invested years of research time in all aspects of caves, mainly their origins, their hydrology and their biology. Caves constitute a small but rather mysterious component of the natural environment - as such they arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge, and consequently have had a considerable amount of research effort devoted to them. Furthermore, because of their presence as natural phenomena, they have had a long history of study, which has been intensified in those parts of the world where caves have had a direct effect on our way of life. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields. Indeed there is a considerable, perhaps unique, overlap between the professional, scientific study of caves and the amateur studies carried out by those who mainly visit caves for sport.

In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique, revolutionary, shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. But when we get to the art of our own day, we get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far, that what he does can no longer be called art. Or, rather, the media say it for us. And, on the whole, we agree because we expect to be puzzled by art's insistent newness - so much so that we do not notice the old themes, methods and also virtues that the art of our own time is full of.
We require artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive, so vigorous that conventions cannot contain them. Previous ages went to artists with commissions: people needed art for specific purposes, and it was part of their ordinary life. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

Picture This

I am going to describe a situation, and then ask a crucial question about it. I hope it doesn't strike you as unduly gnomic. But if it does, that's modern art for you.
Here's the situation. An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book. The text considers the diversity of pictures. 'What are they all about?' it asks dumbly, before deciding, even more dumbly: 'There is no end, in fact, to the number of different kinds of pictures.' Okay, this is kiddy-language, and so far all it has betrayed is kiddy-thinking. But stick with me, all you adults out there. The situation is about to complicate itself.
Having settled on his text, the man then asks someone else to make a canvas for him, to stretch it and prime it, and then to take it along to a sign painter. He asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. And he gives the sign painter specific instructions not to attempt anything flashy or charming with the lettering. The sign painter does all this. On a white canvas, in simple black letters, he writes the chosen text. So my crucial question is this: is the finished product a painting?

Underground Encounters

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

It is an unspoken rule of commercial success as a painter that once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam, and attempts to strike out in a new direction are usually met at best with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.
Why this should be I'm not entirely sure. Gallery owners obviously prefer safe bets, and perhaps the art-buying public is insecure and needs the comfort of continuity. A few artists break the mould and get away with it. Picasso and Hockney are two prime examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now gamely running contrary to form, and it remains to be seen if he can pull it off. His new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground.
Railways hold a peculiar charm for Rimmington. From drawings made in the 1980s of the railway land of Londons Kings Cross Station, it was a logical step to go beneath the ground and look at what was happening below. The sketches have provided the material for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings which convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.

Extract from a novel

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I do not know why I use the word 'escape'. The villagers say jokingly that only a sick man would choose such a remote place to rebuild. Well then, I have come here to heal myself, if you like to put it that way.
Apart from the wrinkled old peasant who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke of the uselessness of art but added nothing truthful about its consolations. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side. Our common actions in reality are simply the sackcloth covering which hides the cloth-of-gold - the meaning of the pattern. For us artists there waits the joyous compromise through art with all that wounded or defeated us in daily life; in this way, not to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination. Otherwise why should we hurt one another?",C2,,"**Art**

Today, people often say that artists must be different from other artists. We like art that is new and special. We enjoy stories about artists who were not famous long ago. But when we see new art, we sometimes feel unsure. We might say, ""This is not art."" The news often says this, and many people agree. We expect new art to be strange, so we do not see the old ideas and good things in it.

We think artists are special people with strong ideas. They should not follow the rules. In the past, people asked artists to make art for their homes or churches. Art was part of normal life. Now, we let artists do what they want, but we get upset if their art is too different.

**Picture This**

I will tell you a story and ask you a question. I hope it is not too strange.

An artist finds some words in a book about art. The words ask, ""What are pictures about?"" Then they say, ""There are many kinds of pictures."" The words are simple.

The artist asks someone to make a canvas. Then he asks a sign painter to write the words on the canvas. He tells the painter to use simple letters. The painter writes the words in black on a white canvas.

My question is: Is this a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

Usually, a successful painter makes the same kind of art. People who buy art expect this. If the artist changes, people are often unhappy.

Why? Maybe gallery owners want art that sells easily. Maybe people feel safer with art they know. Some artists change and are still successful. Picasso and Hockney did this. Eric Rimmington is trying this now. He used to paint still lifes. Now he paints pictures of the London Underground.

Rimmington likes railways. He first drew pictures of a train station above ground. Now he paints the world below ground. His new show has 40 pictures. They show the special feeling of this busy underground place.

**From a book**

I came to this island with some books. I don't know why I say ""came."" The people in the village joke that only a sick person would come here. Okay, you can say I came to feel better.

An old woman comes from the village to clean the house. I am alone. I am not happy or sad. My mind is full of memories.

I said art is not useful, but I did not say how it can help. Making art helps me. When I paint or write, I can change things in my mind. I can understand life better. Real life is like simple cloth hiding beautiful cloth underneath. Art helps artists deal with hard things in life. It helps us understand our lives, not run away from them. If not, why do people hurt each other?","**Art**

In recent times, especially over the last two hundred years, we often talk about artists as if they must always go against the art of their time. We praise art that is different, new, and sometimes even shocking. We like the idea of an artist whose work was not understood a hundred years ago. But when we look at today's art, we become unsure. We might say the artist has gone too far and that their work is not really art. Or, the news and media say this for us. And we usually agree, because we expect new art to be confusing. Because of this, we don't see the old ideas, styles, and good qualities that are also in today's art.

We think artists are different from other people. We see them as people with special skills and strong ideas, who cannot follow normal rules. In the past, people asked artists to make art for a specific reason. Art was a part of their everyday lives. Today, we let artists do what they want, but we get annoyed if they seem too strange or out of touch.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it is not too confusing. But if it is, well, that is modern art for you.

Here is the situation. An artist picks a sentence from a book about art. The sentence talks about the many different kinds of pictures. It asks, ""What are they all about?"" in a simple way. Then it says, ""There is no end, in fact, to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This is simple language, like a child's. But please keep listening.

Next, the artist asks another person to make a canvas for him. This person prepares the canvas and takes it to a sign painter. The artist tells the sign painter to write the chosen sentence on the canvas. He also says the letters should be simple, not fancy. The sign painter does this. On a white canvas, he writes the sentence in plain black letters.

So, my important question is: Is this final object a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

If a painter is successful, there is a quiet rule: if one type of painting sells well, you should keep making the same kind. People who buy art expect the artist to continue in the same style. If the artist tries something new, people often feel disappointed or even angry. They feel the artist has let them down.

I am not completely sure why this happens. Gallery owners like art that they know will sell. Maybe people who buy art feel safer when an artist's work stays the same. A few artists change their style and are still successful. Picasso and Hockney are two famous examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different. We will see if he can do it. His new show is a brave change. Instead of the clean still life paintings that made him famous, he now shows paintings of the London Underground.

Rimmington has always liked railways. In the 1980s, he made drawings of the railway area at London's King's Cross Station. It was a natural next step to go underground and see what was happening there. These drawings became the material for *Underground Encounters*. This exhibition has 40 paintings and drawings that show the special feeling of this underground world, made for people who are travelling.

I said before that art is useless, but I did not talk about how it can help you. The comfort from the work I do with my mind and my feelings is this: only when a painter or a writer is quiet can they change reality, work with it, and show its important side. Our normal, everyday actions are like a plain cloth that hides a beautiful, golden cloth underneath—the true meaning or pattern. For us artists, art is a happy way to deal with things that hurt us or we could not manage in daily life. We do this not to run away from our lives, like many people do, but to live our lives to their full possibility—through our imagination. If not, why do we cause each other pain?","In recent centuries, we have started to talk as if every artist must go against the art of their time. We praise art that is different, new, and even surprising. We like to admire artists whose work was not valued in the past. But when we look at today's art, we become unsure. We say the artist has gone too far, that it isn't art anymore. Or, the media says this for us. We usually agree, because we expect to be confused by art's constant newness. Because of this, we don't see the old ideas, methods, and good qualities that are still present in modern art.

We think of artists as different from other people. We see them as having special skills and energy, so strong that normal rules cannot hold them. In the past, people gave artists specific jobs. They needed art for everyday life. Now, we leave artists alone to do what they want, and we get annoyed if they seem out of touch with the real world.

There is a quiet rule for painters who want to be successful: if you have found a popular style, you should continue with it. People who buy art expect an artist to keep working in the same way. If an artist tries something new, the reaction is often negative. People feel the artist has disappointed them.

In recent centuries, there has been a growing tendency to speak as if every artist must rebel against the artistic conventions of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We take pleasure in admiring artists whose work was not valued a century ago. Yet when we encounter contemporary art, we hesitate, claiming that an artist has gone too far and their work can no longer be considered art. Or, more commonly, the media express this view for us. And generally, we agree, because we expect to be confused by art's constant innovation—so much that we fail to notice the traditional themes, methods, and qualities that are present in today's art.

We expect artists to be different from the rest of society—people with special talents and motivation, so strong that established rules cannot hold them. In the past, people gave artists specific tasks: they needed art for particular uses, and it was part of their normal lives. Today, we leave artists to work independently, but we become annoyed if they seem out of touch with ordinary life.

Picture This

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it does not seem too mysterious—but if it does, that is modern art for you.

Here is the situation: an artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text thinks about the variety of pictures. It naively asks, ""What are they all about?"" before deciding, even more simply, ""In fact, there is no limit to the different kinds of pictures."" Admittedly, the language is childish, and so far it shows only childish thinking. But stay with me, all you adults—the situation is about to get more complicated.

After choosing the text, the artist asks someone else to prepare a canvas—stretching and priming it—and then to take it to a sign painter. He tells the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas, with clear instructions to avoid any fancy or attractive lettering. The sign painter does this. On a white canvas, in simple black letters, he writes the selected text. So my key question is this: is the final product a painting?

Underground Encounters

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

An unspoken rule for commercial success as a painter is that once you have developed a profitable style, you continue with it. Collectors expect an artist to keep working in the same way, and efforts to try something new are often met with disappointment and the feeling that the artist has let down the public.

The reasons for this are not completely clear. Gallery owners obviously prefer safe choices, and perhaps the art-buying public lacks confidence and wants the security of consistency. A few artists break the pattern and succeed—Picasso and Hockney are famous examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now bravely going against expectations, and it is uncertain whether he will succeed. His new exhibition takes the bold step of replacing the perfect still lifes that made him famous with paintings of the London Underground.

Railways have a special appeal for Rimmington. After making drawings in the 1980s of the railway area around London's King's Cross Station, it was a natural next step to go underground and look at what was happening below. These sketches have provided the basis for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the strange magic of this underground world designed for people passing through.

I have come to this island with a few books. I am not sure why I use the word ""escape."" The local people joke that only someone unwell would choose such a distant place to rebuild. Well then, if you like, I have come here to recover.

Apart from an elderly peasant woman who comes from the village each day on her mule to clean the house, I am completely alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel as if I am floating, like a hair or a feather, in the unclear mixture of memory. I spoke about the pointlessness of art but said nothing true about its comforts. The relief I find in the work I do with my mind and heart is this: only in the quiet moments of the painter or the writer can reality be rearranged, reworked, and made to show its important side. Our everyday actions are just the rough covering that hides the valuable cloth—the meaning of the pattern. For us artists, there is the happy possibility through art of making peace with all that has hurt or beaten us in daily life; in this way, we do not try to avoid fate, as ordinary people do, but to achieve its real potential—through imagination. Otherwise, why do we cause each other pain?",
268,"Garbage in, garbage out

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be.

Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals, rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip.
To economists, this ceremony is peculiar, because in most places it is free. Yes, households pay for the service out of local taxes but the family that fills four bins with rubbish each week pays no more than the elderly couple that fills one.
Yet the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero at all. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more the local authorities have to pay in landfill and tipping fees. This looks like the most basic of economic problems: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish.
The obvious solution is to make households pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. That will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more (assuming that local governments provide collection points for suitable materials).
But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, have found, what appears to be the logical approach to an everyday problem has surprisingly intricate and sometimes disappointing results.
Research focused on several American towns and cities which, in the past few years, have started charging households for generating rubbish. The commonest system is to sell stickers or tags which householders attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up in the weekly collection. 
In a paper published last year Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman concentrated on the effects of one such scheme, introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may sound like sensible use of market forces. In fact, the authors conclude, the schemes benefits did not cover the cost of printing materials, the commissions to sellers and the wages of the people running the scheme.
True, the number of bags or cans did fall sharply, by 37%. But this was largely thanks to the 'Seattle stomp', a frantic dance first noticed when that distant city introduced rubbish pricing. Rather than buy more tags, people simply crammed more garbage - about 40% more -- into each container by jumping on it if necessary.
As we all know, such compacting is done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals, however enthusiastically. The weight of rubbish collected (a better indicator of disposal costs than volume) fell by a modest 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities where no pricing scheme was in place, and which were used as a rough-and-ready control group, it fell by 3.5% in any case.
Less pleasing still, some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay to have their rubbish removed. This is hard to measure directly but the authors guess that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish.
The one bright spot in the whole experience seems to have been a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) rather than pay to have their refuse carted away. But the fee may have little to do with the growth in recycling, as many citizens were already participating in Charlottesville's voluntary scheme.
In a more recent study, Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman explore the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion from this broader study is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish - but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts quantity only by 0.3%.
This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns, but is it so surprising? To reduce their output of rubbish by a lot, people would have to buy less of just about everything. A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference.
If that's the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw out more rubbish than in poorer ones and they have less time for recycling.
Should we conclude that the idea of charging households for the rubbish they produce is daft? Not at all: free disposal after all is surely too cheap. But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.",C2,,,"Garbage in, garbage out

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems good for the environment and for saving money. But it might not work as we think.

In many rich countries, people live in similar ways. One example is rubbish collection: every week, a special truck takes away rubbish bags or bins to a dump.

To economists, this is interesting because in most places it is free. Yes, families pay for this service through local taxes. But a family with four bins pays the same as an old couple with only one bin.

But getting rid of rubbish costs money. If people throw away more rubbish, the town needs more workers and more trucks. The local government must pay more money. This is a simple problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will make too much rubbish.

One idea is to make families pay for the rubbish they throw away. This could make people throw away less and recycle more (if the town has places to recycle).

But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this good idea can have problems and disappointing results.

They looked at some American towns that started charging families for rubbish. Usually, families must buy stickers and put them on their rubbish bags. Only bags with stickers are collected.

The economists studied one town called Charlottesville in Virginia. About 40,000 people live there. In 1992, the town started this system. People paid 80 cents for each bag with a sticker. This sounds like a smart idea. But the money from the stickers did not pay for the cost of the program.

It is true that the number of bags went down a lot, by 37%. But this happened because people put more rubbish into each bag. They jumped on the bags to make more space. They put about 40% more rubbish in each bag.

Machines at the dump can press rubbish down better than people. The weight of the rubbish (which is more important than the number of bags) went down by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other towns in Virginia without this system, the weight went down by 3.5% anyway.

Another bad thing: some people started throwing their rubbish in illegal places to avoid paying. It is hard to know how much, but the authors think illegal dumping may have caused 30-40% of the drop in collected rubbish.

One good thing was that recycling went up by 15%. This suggests people chose to recycle (which was free) instead of paying to throw rubbish away. But the town already had a recycling program, so the fee may not have been the main reason.

In another study, the economists learned more about rubbish. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the weight a little—but not much. On average, if the sticker price goes up by 10%, the amount of rubbish goes down by only 0.3%.

This is a small change. Why? To throw away much less rubbish, people would need to buy much less of everything. A small weekly fee cannot change this much.

So, other things may be as important as price. For example, how much money people have or their education. People in richer towns throw away more rubbish and recycle less.

Does this mean charging for rubbish is a bad idea? Not exactly: free rubbish disposal is probably too cheap. But even simple ideas can have complicated results. We often need careful studies to understand them. And sometimes, the results are not what we want.","The phrase ""garbage in, garbage out"" means that poor input leads to poor results.

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it might not be as effective as it seems.

In many developed countries, one common routine is the regular collection of household rubbish by the local council. A special truck takes the rubbish bags or bins away to a landfill site.

Economists find this system unusual because, in most places, the service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little.

However, getting rid of rubbish does cost money. The more rubbish people produce, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more the local council has to pay in landfill fees. This is a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish.

A clear solution is to make households pay for the cost of getting rid of their waste. This should encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, especially if local governments provide recycling points.

But as two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, discovered, this logical solution to an everyday problem has surprisingly complicated and sometimes disappointing results.

They studied several American towns that had started charging households for their rubbish. The most common system was to sell special stickers. Householders had to put a sticker on each bag for it to be collected.

In one study, the economists looked at a system introduced in a town called Charlottesville. Residents had to pay 80 cents for each bag of rubbish with a sticker. This sounds like a good use of market forces. However, the economists found that the money collected did not even cover the costs of the stickers and running the scheme.

It is true that the number of rubbish bags collected fell by 37%. But this was mostly because people started packing about 40% more rubbish into each bag, often by stamping on it to make more space. This behaviour was first noticed in the city of Seattle.

Machines at landfill sites can compact rubbish much better than people can. A better way to measure the cost of disposal is by the weight of the rubbish, not the number of bags. In Charlottesville, the weight of rubbish only fell by 14%. In other towns in the same area that did not have this pricing system, the weight of rubbish fell by 3.5% anyway.

Another problem was that some people started dumping their rubbish illegally to avoid paying. The authors estimated that this illegal dumping might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish.

One positive result was a 15% increase in the weight of recycled materials. This suggests that people chose to recycle because it was free, rather than pay to have their rubbish taken away. However, it is hard to know if the fee caused this increase, as many people were already part of a voluntary recycling program.

In a later study, the economists looked at the issue in more detail. They concluded that charging for rubbish does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not by a large amount. On average, if the price of a sticker goes up by 10%, the amount of rubbish is reduced by only 0.3%.

This number is quite small. To reduce their rubbish a lot, people would have to buy much less of everything. A small charge on a week's rubbish is unlikely to make that happen.

This makes you wonder if other things, like how much money people have and their level of education, are just as important as price. For example, people in richer towns throw away more rubbish and have less time for recycling.

So, is the idea of charging for rubbish a bad one? Not necessarily. Free disposal is probably too cheap. But the effects of policies that seem simple are often complex. Complicated economic models are often needed to understand them. And sometimes, the results of this investigation are not very pleasant.","The principle of ""garbage in, garbage out"" can be aptly applied to waste management policy. While charging households per bag of refuse appears both environmentally responsible and economically rational, the actual outcomes may be more complex than anticipated.

Across developed nations, municipal waste collection follows a similar pattern: refuse is regularly collected by specialised vehicles and transported to landfill sites. Economists regard this system as unusual, since the service is typically funded through local taxation rather than direct usage fees. Consequently, households generating substantial waste incur the same cost as those producing minimal amounts.

Nevertheless, waste disposal entails significant costs. Higher volumes of rubbish necessitate more collection staff, vehicles, and landfill fees, creating a fundamental economic issue: when disposal is free, overproduction of waste becomes inevitable.

The apparent solution is to impose charges reflecting the marginal cost of waste disposal, thereby incentivising households to reduce waste and increase recycling—particularly when local authorities provide adequate recycling infrastructure.

However, as economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman have demonstrated, this seemingly logical approach yields surprisingly intricate and often disappointing results. Their research examined American municipalities that implemented systems requiring households to purchase stickers for each rubbish bag collected.

Analysing one such scheme in Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents paid 80 cents per bag, the economists found that administrative costs exceeded the benefits. Although the number of bags collected declined by 37%, this reduction was largely attributable to the ""Seattle stomp""—a practice where households compressed approximately 40% more waste into each container.

Given that industrial compactors achieve superior compression, the weight of rubbish—a more accurate measure of disposal costs—decreased by only 14%. By comparison, control municipalities without pricing schemes still experienced a 3.5% reduction in waste weight.

Furthermore, illegal dumping emerged as a significant unintended consequence, potentially accounting for 30-40% of the apparent reduction in collected waste. While recycling rates increased by 15%, this trend may not be directly attributable to the pricing scheme, as many residents already participated in voluntary recycling programmes.

Subsequent research revealed that price increases have minimal impact on waste reduction: a 10% price rise correlates with merely a 0.3% decrease in rubbish.

These findings suggest that socioeconomic factors such as income and education may be equally important determinants. Wealthier households, for instance, typically generate more waste and demonstrate lower recycling participation.

Does this imply that waste charging schemes are fundamentally flawed? Not necessarily—free disposal clearly represents an inadequate pricing structure. However, ostensibly straightforward policies frequently produce complex outcomes. Sophisticated economic modelling is often required to unravel these effects, and the conclusions are not always favourable.",
269,"MUSIC AND THEATRE

Up until quite recently, I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house, I learned that opera is, in fact, only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That's as it should be, of course. But I come from a different world, the world of the theatre, where the word and the actor speaking it have primacy, where there is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way, and where performer and audience (mostly) speak the same language.
At any musical performance, whether in concert hall or opera house, there will generally be a substantial minority of people who, like me, have little technical or academic understanding of music. Some of them will be aware of, possibly even embarrassed by, how much they don't know. Most will be awestruck by the skill of the performers. A dazzling coloratura or an impeccable string section are easy to admire. Even a moderately good musician is showing us the results of years of punishingly hard work. Being in the audience for top-class music is not unlike watching an athletics match - we know athletes are doing something broadly similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also recognise by how much it excess our best efforts.
Theatre audiences by contrast, come with a different set of expectations. In the main they do not understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually impressed when an actor completes a long and difficult speech (although 'how do you learn all those lines?' is the question every actor gets asked). None of this means that theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall, indeed quite a lot of them are the same people. What perhaps it does mean is that audiences and performer meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event. The question is, does music need to learn anything from the theatre about this relationship? I would say yes, partly because I have seen how a different approach can transform the concert-goers experience.
Music in live performance is inherently theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, vulnerable to the possibility that something will go unexpectedly wrong, reaching into the imagination of the listener not just as an individual but as part of a collective. The conventions which still largely dominate music presentation, including strict dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasise the difference between players and listeners in a way which often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. On the other hand, the tendency of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a canicular piece of virtuosity, while it is often a spontaneous expression of appreciation, can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the whole work.
Is there anything to be done? Of course a huge amount is being done. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the staging of Jonathan Dove's community opera In Search of Angels, which followed the action from location to location within a cathedral and then out into the town. It was a musical experience of the highest order, in which the skills, and the generosity, of the professional musicians were absolutely central and it was also life-changing for many of the audience, who were not just there to see and hear but also to contribute directly.
Perhaps what I yearn for in music is a bit more of the risk and radicalism that theatre at its best can display. Sometimes it can come from the use of unfamiliar or challenging locations, where normal expectations are disrupted. This can have startling effects on performer and audience alike. Comforts may have to be foregone, perhaps the acoustic isn't great, maybe it's a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be intrepid as they follow artists into the most unpromising spaces. I accept that most plays get put on in a pretty uncontroversial way, not greatly different from what happens in a conmen hall. However I remain convinced that something can and should happen to change the conventions of music-going. The only authority I can claim is that of the enthusiast: I love, and live by, the theatre and I spend as much time (and money) as I can going to hear music. I want them both to thrive, and for more and more people to get the pleasure I get from being the audience. ",C2,,"Music and Theatre

I thought opera was mainly theatre. But I was wrong. I worked for a short time at an opera house. I learned that music is the most important part of opera. Theatre is second. This is right, I think. But I know the theatre world better. In theatre, the words and the actors are the most important. No one tells the actors what to do during the show. The actors and the people watching usually speak the same language.

At a music show, many people are like me. They do not know much about music. Some people feel bad because they do not know much. Most people think the musicians are very good. It is easy to like a singer with a nice voice or a group of good string players. Even a good musician shows us many years of hard work. Watching great music is like watching a sports game. The athletes are doing something we can do, like running, but they are much better.

Theatre audiences are different. Most people do not see that acting is hard work. They are not very surprised because acting can look easy. People are not very impressed when an actor says many words. This does not mean theatre audiences are nicer. Many people go to both theatre and music shows. It might mean that in the theatre, the audience and the actors are more like equals. The show can be hard or exciting, but they are together.

So, can music learn from theatre? I think yes. I have seen a different way to do a concert. It was better for the people watching.

Live music is like theatre. It has strong feelings, fun, and sadness. It can feel close. Sometimes things can go wrong. It makes people think and feel together. But the rules for music shows are often strict. People wear special clothes. They show a lot of respect to the conductor and the main players. This makes a big space between the players and the listeners. It can feel like some people are more important.

Sometimes, people clap in the middle of the music. They do this because they like it. But it can break the feeling of the music.

Can we change this? Yes. People are trying. They want new people to come to concert halls. They want people to feel that serious music is for them too. I remember a special opera called ""In Search of Angels"". The show moved to different places in a big church and then into the town. The music was very good. The musicians were kind and skilled. For many people watching, it changed their lives. They were not just watching; they were a part of it.

Maybe I want music to be more like the best theatre. I want it to take more risks and try new ideas. Sometimes, a show is in a strange place. This changes what people think will happen. It can be very good for the performers and the audience. It might not be comfortable. The sound might not be perfect. It might be cold. But theatre audiences are brave. They will go to unusual places with the artists.

I know most plays happen in a normal way, like a concert. But I think we can change the old rules for music shows. I am not an expert. I just love theatre and music. I go to the theatre a lot. I listen to music as much as I can. I want both to do well. I want more people to feel the joy I feel when I watch a show.","Music and Theatre

I used to think that opera was mostly theatre. But that changed after I worked for a short time at a national opera house. I learned that in opera, music is the most important thing. Theatre comes second. That is right, I think. But I come from the theatre world, where the words and the actors are the main thing. In theatre, no one tells the actors what to do during the show. Also, the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.

At a music performance, like in a concert hall or opera house, there are often many people who do not know much about music. I am one of them. Some people feel a little bad about what they don't know. Most people are very impressed by how good the performers are. It is easy to like a singer with a great voice or a group of musicians who play perfectly. Even a quite good musician shows us the results of many years of hard work. Watching top-level music is a bit like watching a sports event. We know the athletes are doing something like running for a bus, but we see they are much, much better at it.

Theatre audiences think about things differently. Most of them do not understand how difficult acting is. They are not very impressed by something that often looks easy, like something they could do. They are not usually amazed when an actor says a long and difficult speech. This does not mean that theatre audiences are nicer or want less than music audiences. In fact, many people go to both. It might mean that in the theatre, the audience and the performer feel more equal. This is true even if the play is very difficult. So, can music learn something from theatre about this? I think yes. I have seen how a different way of doing things can make concerts better for the people watching.

Live music is full of drama. It has strong feelings, fun, sadness, and big moments. Sometimes, something can go wrong by accident. It makes the listener imagine things, both alone and as part of a group. But the old ways of music performances can be a problem. For example, there are strict rules about what to wear. Also, conductors and soloists are treated as very special people. This makes a big difference between the players and the listeners. It can feel like some people are more important than others. Also, today, audiences sometimes clap in the middle of a piece of music. This is a nice way to show they like it, but it can break the feeling of the whole piece of music.

Can we change this? Yes, people are already doing a lot. In many places, people are working to bring new audiences to concert halls and opera houses. They want to stop people thinking that 'serious' music is not for them. I remember a special performance of Jonathan Dove's community opera, *In Search of Angels*. The story moved from one place to another inside a big church and then into the town. It was a wonderful music experience. The professional musicians were very skilled and kind. For many people in the audience, it was an event that changed their lives. They were not just watching and listening; they were taking part, too.

Maybe what I want for music is to have a little more risk and new ideas, like the best theatre has. Sometimes, we can use unusual or difficult places for performances. This changes what people expect. It can have great effects on the performers and the audience. It might not be as comfortable. The sound might not be perfect, or it might be a little cold. But theatre audiences have learned to be brave and go with artists to unusual places. I know that most plays are done in a normal way, like in a concert hall. But I still believe we can and should change the old ways of going to hear music. I say this because I love both theatre and music very much. I go to see music as often as I can. I want both theatre and music to do well. I want more and more people to feel the same happiness I feel when I am in the audience.","Until recently, I would have said that opera is mainly theatre. Not anymore. After a short time working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is actually only partly theatre. The music is more important. That's how it should be, of course. But I come from a different background, the world of theatre, where the words and the actors saying them are most important. In theatre, nobody directs the action during the performance, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.

At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or opera house, there are often many people who, like me, don't have much technical knowledge about music. Some of them might feel uncomfortable about how much they don't know. Most are amazed by the performers' skill. It's easy to admire a brilliant singer or a perfect group of string players. Even a fairly good musician shows us the results of many years of very hard work. Watching excellent music is similar to watching an athletics competition - we know athletes are doing something like running for a bus, but we see how much better they are than us.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. Mostly, they don't understand actors' skills and aren't very impressed by something that often looks like what they could do themselves. They aren't usually amazed when an actor finishes a long, difficult speech (though actors always get asked ""how do you remember all those words?""). This doesn't mean theatre audiences are kinder or less demanding than concert audiences - in fact, many people go to both. What it might mean is that in theatre, audiences and performers meet more as equals, no matter how difficult the play or impressive the production.

The question is: can music learn anything from theatre about this relationship? I think yes, because I've seen how a different approach can change the concert experience.

Live music is naturally theatrical - full of emotion, humor, sadness, closeness, and greatness. There's always the chance something might go wrong. It speaks to listeners both as individuals and as a group. However, the traditions that still control music performances, including formal clothing and great respect for conductors and soloists, highlight the difference between players and listeners in a way that can feel too formal. On the other hand, modern audiences sometimes break the performance's flow by clapping between sections or after impressive solos. While this often shows real appreciation, it can also ignore the complete work's dramatic structure.

Can anything be done? Actually, much is already being done. Across the country, people are working hard to bring new audiences to concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people think ""serious"" music isn't for them. I remember an amazing performance of Jonathan Dove's community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which moved between different locations in a cathedral and then into the town. It was wonderful music where professional musicians' skills and generosity were essential, and it changed many audience members' lives because they didn't just watch and listen - they actively participated.

Perhaps what I want in music is more of the risk and innovation that the best theatre can offer. Sometimes this comes from using unusual or challenging places that break normal expectations. This can have surprising effects on both performers and audiences. People might have to give up some comforts - maybe the sound isn't perfect or it's a bit cold - but theatre audiences have learned to be brave as they follow artists into unlikely spaces. I know most plays are performed in quite ordinary ways, not very different from concert halls. Still, I believe something can and should change about how we experience music. My only qualification is that I'm an enthusiast: I love theatre and it's part of my life, and I spend as much time and money as possible going to concerts. I want both art forms to succeed, and for more people to enjoy being in the audience as much as I do.","MUSIC AND THEATRE

Until recently, I would have described opera as being primarily a form of theatre. My view has now changed. After a short time working at a national opera house, I realised that opera is actually only secondarily theatre. The music is the most important element, which is as it should be. However, my own background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor delivering it are central, where there is no one directing the action once the performance has started, and where the performers and audience usually share the same language.

At most musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, there is usually a large number of people who, like me, have very little technical or academic knowledge of music. Some of them are conscious of, and possibly even embarrassed by, how much they do not know. Most, however, are deeply impressed by the performers' skill. A brilliant coloratura singer or a perfect string section are easy to admire. Even a fairly good musician shows the results of many years of extremely hard work. Watching a top-level music performance is a bit like watching an athletics competition—we understand that the performers are doing something similar to what we might do, but we also see how much it goes beyond our own abilities.

Theatre audiences, on the other hand, come with different expectations. Generally, they do not understand the nature of an actor’s skill and are not especially impressed by an activity that often seems quite close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually amazed when an actor performs a long and complex speech—although every actor is often asked, ""How do you remember all those lines?"". This does not mean that theatre audiences are kinder or less critical than those in the concert hall; in fact, many people attend both. What it might mean is that in the theatre, performers and audiences meet on more equal terms, no matter how difficult the material or impressive the production. So the question is: can music learn anything from theatre about this relationship? I believe it can, partly because I have seen how a different approach can greatly improve the experience for concert-goers.

Live music is naturally theatrical, filled with emotion, humour, intimacy, and grandeur, and always open to the risk that something might go wrong. It speaks to the listener's imagination both as an individual and as part of a group. Yet the traditions that still control much musical performance—such as formal dress codes and showing great respect to conductors and soloists—often highlight the separation between performers and audiences in a way that can feel too formal and hierarchical. At the same time, the modern habit of audiences clapping between sections of a piece or after a display of great skill, while usually meant as a compliment, can interrupt the flow and damage the overall effect of the work.

Can anything be done? Certainly, a great deal is already happening. All over the country, new and creative projects are bringing new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and breaking down the barriers that make people think that 'serious' music is not for them. I remember an outstanding event—a performance of Jonathan Dove’s community opera, *In Search of Angels*—which moved from one place to another inside a cathedral and then out into the town. It was a musical experience of the highest quality, depending completely on the ability and generosity of the professional musicians, and it was a life-changing event for many in the audience, who were not just watching and listening but also taking part directly.

Perhaps what I want in music is a little more of the daring and originality that the best theatre can offer. This can sometimes come from using unusual or difficult locations, where normal assumptions are challenged. This can have a powerful effect on both performers and audiences. Some comforts might be lost—perhaps the sound quality is not perfect, or the space is a bit cold—but theatre audiences have become brave, following artists into the most unlikely places. I accept that most plays are performed in a fairly standard way, not so different from what happens in a concert hall. Still, I am sure that something can and should change about the traditions of attending live music. My only qualification is that I am an enthusiast: I love and am deeply involved in theatre, and I spend as much time and money as I can going to listen to music. I want both to be successful, and for more and more people to enjoy the pleasure I get from being in the audience.",
270,"Air-conditioning

There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym, a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so, in fact, that at quiet times, the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. This is just one example of how the modern world casually misuses air-conditioning. It has become a central feature of work and play, a potent symbol of the ability of humanity to control the climate, or at least modify it.
Many air-conditioned buildings, however, could employ other methods of cooling. They could take advantage of daylight and natural ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and radiate it away at night. These measures may sound obvious, but they can have telling results and would considerably reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It is surely more than coincidence that the beginning of a new millennium is being accompanied by renewed interest in sundials: instruments used to measure time according to the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were a vital time-keeping device, essential for anyone who hoped to keep their clocks working accurately. Then, as clocks and watches became more sophisticated and reliable, the sundial was relegated to the status of garden ornament - a romantic and intriguing ornament, but nonetheless an anachronism, in a brave new technological age. Now the clock has been turned back and they are again being taken seriously.
David Harber, a sundial maker, believes that their appeal lies in their direct link with the planets. He says that when he delivers one, there is a moment of magic when it starts working. They are still, calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the cosmos.

Paint Your Own China

My image of china-painting stemmed from a visit, long ago, to an arts and crafts exhibition where stern-looking grey-haired ladies demonstrated how to cover a teacup with delicate flowers using a series of deft brushstrokes. The spectacle was riveting, because each stroke formed a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands never wobbled, the paint never smudged, and the observer might have concluded that these women had either been practising their art for decades or had been born with an extraordinary talent for steady precision.
Mindful of this experience, I wondered what kind of people would have the courage to enrol on a course in china-painting. Would even the beginners display an intuitive artistry? In fact, the atmosphere turned out to be far from intimidating. The students were all there to have fun and not even the tutor wanted to paint petals on teacups with the robotic rapidity I had remembered.",C2,,,"**Air-Conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular place for office workers to go at lunchtime, the air is very cold. Because of this summer's very hot weather, the gym has used too much air-conditioning. When the gym is quiet, it feels as cold as the Arctic. This shows how people today often use air-conditioning in the wrong way. It is now an important part of work and free time. It shows how people can control the weather, or at least change it a little.

However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use more daylight and open windows for fresh air. They could also have thicker walls that take in less heat during the day and let it out at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they work well and would mean much less air-conditioning is needed.

**Sundials**

It is probably not a coincidence that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that use the sun’s position to tell the time. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping clocks correct. Later, when clocks and watches became better, sundials became just decorations for the garden. They were beautiful and interesting, but old-fashioned. Now, people are taking them seriously once more.

David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says that when he sets one up, it feels magical when it begins to work. Sundials are peaceful and romantic objects that help us remember our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of painting china came from a visit, a long time ago, to an arts and crafts show. There, serious-looking older women showed how to paint small flowers on a teacup with quick, careful brushstrokes. It was amazing to watch because every stroke made a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands never shook, the paint never made a mess, and you might think these women had been painting for many years or were born with a special talent.

Thinking about this, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting class. Would even the beginners have a natural skill? Actually, the feeling in the class was not scary at all. The students were all there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint petals on teacups as quickly and perfectly as I remembered.","Air-Conditioning

Cannons Gym, a popular lunchtime spot for workers in the City of London, feels very cold inside. To manage the unusually hot weather this summer, the gym has used its air-conditioning too much. In fact, when it is not busy, the gym feels almost as cold as the Arctic. This is one example of how people today often use air-conditioning in the wrong way. It has become an important part of work and free time, a strong sign of how humans can control the weather, or at least change it a little.

However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could make better use of daylight and fresh air, and have thicker walls that take in less heat during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It is probably not a coincidence that as we enter a new millennium, people are becoming interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell the time using the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were an important way to tell time, necessary for anyone who wanted their clocks to be accurate. Later, when clocks and watches became more advanced and dependable, sundials became just garden decorations—interesting and romantic, but out of place in a modern, technological world. Now, things have changed, and people are taking sundials seriously once more.

David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks their appeal comes from their direct connection to the planets. He says that when he installs one, there is a special moment when it begins to work. Sundials are peaceful, beautiful objects that make us think about our position in the universe.

There, serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup using quick, skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands never shook, the paint never spread, and you might have thought these women had been practising for many years or were born with a natural talent for being so precise.

Remembering this, I wondered what kind of person would be brave enough to join a china-painting class. Would even the beginners show a natural artistic skill? Actually, the atmosphere was not frightening at all. The students were all there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint petals on teacups with the fast, mechanical movements I remembered.",,
271,"The Lure of the Kitchen

When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is, on the face of it, an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long, pressured, menial - and badly paid.
But such considerations didn't put me off. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard;
the social scene was insular and self-important. Being a chef seemed the perfect antidote to intellectual and social posturing. It promised a seriousness and integrity lacking in my college life.
But my desire to cook was not simply a reaction to being a student. It also expressed an aesthetic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards.
After this, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretence, distracting me from my true course. I acquired my real education haphazardly and deficiently by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens and preparing extravagant meals.

Extract from a novel

The school's swimming instructor was an ex-drill sergeant, small and muscle-bound, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pools edge, put my hands above my head and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet. I practised that manoeuvre until the hour was up. The next visit, he got me standing upright, and diving off the edge. The instructor was a martinet and every time I surfaced he looked at me with distaste: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed outrageously high as I stood there, trying to work up my courage. Gradually the echoing voices disappeared and I felt as if I were cocooned in silence. I waved my arms vaguely in the way I'd been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled ignominiously, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not diminish my euphoria. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.

The Traveller

To those of us for whom a comfortable bed, running water and the probability of living at least until tomorrow are of prime importance, the phenomenon of the traveller appears as incomprehensible as it is intriguing. Here are people who have succumbed to the treacherous seduction of the unknown, who actually choose to put their lives at risk by climbing the sheer and icy face of an avalanche-ridden mountain; who sail alone in frail craft through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing more palatable is on offer and who can live, day and night for months on end, in the shadow and the promise of the unknown.
It is easy to dismiss such people as oddities - as indeed they are - to be relegated to the ranks of the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers or indeed writers. That they exist cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they occupy lies well outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as an irrelevancy. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answerphones, glad that the only risks to our own health are predictable ones such as making a suicidal dash across a city street.

SAILING

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his element, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is obviously a competent one. His overriding reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is guaranteed to provide alarms and achievements for his pen to celebrate.
Raban's little boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives mariners their position to within a few metres, anywhere on the earth's surface. Strongly as he approves of this instrument, there is more than a touch of primitivism in Raban's attitude to other sea-faring aids. He thinks the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a 'fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea'. Raban maintains that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main object of the steersman's gaze, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things going on in it, is now reduced to a mere space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long stretches by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves.",C2,,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. My friends thought this was a strange choice. Most of us did not want to be cooks. It is not a nice job. Chefs have very hard lives. The work is long and difficult, and they do not earn much money.

But this did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was hard, and I did not like the people. Being a chef seemed like a good way to escape. It felt honest and real, unlike my life at college.

But I did not want to cook just because I was a student. I also thought it was beautiful. I first understood this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I still remember my first dish. I finished the meal and felt so happy I wanted to cry. I felt light and warm for days after.

After that, I really wanted to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life to get ready for a life as a chef. I stopped caring about my history studies. My real learning came from reading cookbooks, going to food markets, and cooking big meals.

**The Swimming Lesson**

My school's swimming teacher was a small, strong man with tattoos on his arms. He used to be in the army. I asked him to teach me to dive. First, he told me to sit by the pool, put my hands up, and roll into the water. I practiced that for a long time.

The next time, he taught me to stand up and dive from the side of the pool. The teacher was very strict. Every time I came up from the water, he was not happy. He shouted, ""Don't look down, look up! Keep your legs straight! Point your toes!""

The next week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high and I was scared. The noisy pool became quiet. I moved my arms like I was taught, tried to look up, and jumped. For a short time, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, it was not a good dive. My legs were not straight. The teacher looked at me and shook his head. But I was still very, very happy. I thought, ""This is what it means to be free as a bird.""

**The Traveller**

For most of us, a comfortable bed, clean water, and being safe are the most important things. So, travellers seem very strange and interesting to us. These are people who love the unknown. They choose to do dangerous things. They climb high, icy mountains. They sail alone in small boats on big seas. They will eat insects if they have no other food. They live for months with danger and the promise of new things.

It is easy to say these people are just strange. We can put them in a group with other unusual people, like hermits or writers. They are real, but their world is very different from ours. We are happy to go back to our safe world with modern things like microwaves. We are glad that the only danger in our day is maybe crossing a busy street.

Raban's small boat has a machine. It tells him exactly where he is on the sea. He likes this machine, but he is not happy with other sailing tools. He thinks the compass was a bad invention. He says it changed how people and the sea work together. Now, the person sailing just looks at the compass. He does not need to watch the waves or feel the sea. The ocean, which was once a living place, is now just empty space. Because the sailor's job is easy, a machine can often do it instead.

He believes the invention of the compass was a bad thing, creating a 'basic break in the connection between people and the sea'. Raban says that since it started being used, maybe a thousand years ago, it has become the main thing the person steering looks at. Because of this, they no longer need to watch the waves and sense the sea. The ocean, which was once a place full of activity, has now become just an empty area. Since the helmsman's job is only to keep the boat on a straight path, they can be replaced for long periods by an automatic pilot. This might be why Raban had so much time to observe the waves carefully.","The Allure of the Kitchen

During my university years, I resolved to pursue a career as a chef—a decision that was unconventional among my peers. Culinary work was not regarded as a prestigious occupation; on the contrary, it appeared distinctly unappealing. Chefs are known to endure gruelling working conditions: the hours are long, the environment is stressful, the tasks are often repetitive, and the remuneration is modest.

Yet these drawbacks did not deter me. I was discontented with university life, finding the academic demands strenuous and the social atmosphere insular and pretentious. Becoming a chef seemed the ideal antidote to such intellectual and social affectation. It offered a sense of purpose and authenticity that was absent from my college experience.

However, my aspiration to cook was not merely a reaction against student life. It also reflected an aesthetic ideal. This first became apparent during a meal I had at a renowned London restaurant—an experience that proved nothing short of revelatory. I can still vividly recall my starter. By the end of the meal, I felt an overwhelming urge to prostrate myself at the feet of the chef in tearful admiration. For days afterward, I felt buoyant and elated.

From that point on, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this extraordinary art form. I reshaped my student life into an extended period of preparation for my entry into the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretence, diverting me from my true vocation. My real education was acquired in a haphazard and incomplete manner—through reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and preparing elaborate meals.

Extract from a Novel

The school’s swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant—compact and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I requested diving lessons, he instructed me to sit at the pool’s edge, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I repeated this manoeuvre until the session ended. On the following visit, he had me stand upright and dive from the edge. The instructor was a strict disciplinarian, and each time I surfaced, he regarded me with disapproval, barking commands: “Don’t look down—look up!” “Keep your legs straight!” “Point your toes, I said!” 

The next week, I ascended the high diving board—a fixed platform with a downward curve at the front. As I stood there, summoning my courage, the height seemed staggering. Gradually, the echoing voices faded, and I felt enveloped in silence. I waved my arms as instructed, focused upward rather than downward, and launched myself into the air. For a fleeting moment, I experienced the sensation of flight. Upon hitting the water, my form collapsed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor shot me a contemptuous glance and shook his head. Yet even his disapproval could not diminish my exhilaration. So this is what they mean by “free as a bird,” I thought.

The Traveller

To those of us who prioritise a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of surviving until tomorrow, the phenomenon of the traveller is as baffling as it is fascinating. These are individuals who have yielded to the perilous allure of the unknown—who deliberately risk their lives by scaling the sheer, icy slopes of avalanche-prone mountains; who navigate towering seas alone in fragile vessels; who consume maggots and river insects when no more palatable sustenance is available; and who endure, for months on end, a life overshadowed by the promise and peril of the unfamiliar.

It is tempting to dismiss such individuals as eccentrics—which, admittedly, they are—and relegate them to the company of hermits, free-divers, or even writers. While their existence is undeniable, the strange and unsettling world they inhabit lies far beyond our everyday experience, allowing us to dismiss it as irrelevant. We can shrug our shoulders and retreat gratefully to our world of microwave ovens and answering machines, relieved that the only risks to our health are predictable ones, such as making a reckless dash across a busy city street.

Sailing

Jonathan Raban admits to a fear of the sea, acknowledging that it is not his natural element—which may explain why he spends so much time on it. Though he makes no claim to being a world-class sailor, he is clearly a competent one. His primary motivation for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his maritime experiences. Sailing reliably supplies both perils and triumphs for his pen to commemorate.

Raban’s small vessel is equipped with an electronic device that provides mariners with their precise location, accurate to within a few metres, anywhere on the globe. While he strongly approves of this instrument, his attitude toward other nautical aids is tinged with primitivism. He regards the invention of the compass as a catastrophe, responsible for a “fundamental rift in the relationship between humanity and the sea.” Raban contends that since its introduction roughly a millennium ago, the compass has become the central focus of the helmsman’s attention, with the consequence that he no longer needs to observe the waves or attune himself to the sea. The ocean, once a realm teeming with activity, has been reduced to mere space. Since the task of maintaining a steady course can be delegated for long periods to an autopilot, the helmsman’s role is diminished. This may explain why Raban had the opportunity to study the waves so attentively.",
272,"Work

Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.

Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood, and even among individuals who have won eminence, there is often bitterness behind the fame. Loving your work, until recently, was enough to make you a member of an envied minority. But now you have to ask yourself what your job is doing to you as a person, to your mind, character and relationships.
This question is crucial. For however brilliant your skills, if they make you a bore, unable to converse with those outside your speciality, if you are so busy with detail that you have no time to acquire wisdom or exercise your imagination or humour, then no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this, I am trying to discover how work could have the fulfilment of these aspirations as its first priority - instead of treating us as clay to be moulded to suit industrial purposes - and how it could be reconceived to suit us all, both women and men. It would have to be not just a way of creating wealth, but a worthwhile style of life, a path to a fuller existence, to the discovery of unsuspected talents and to a wider variety of human contacts.
However, this remodelling would not mean abolishing unemployment. This is too simple a goal, because the more people are educated, the more they demand jobs that are life-enhancing, interesting and useful. A lifetime of work has to be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its centre.
Even the middle-class professions, however, no longer have the liberating appeal they once had. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients and complain about the failure of clinical medicine. Accountants, despite unprecedented influence, are troubled by doubts about their profession's ethics. Most architects never get the chance to exercise their imaginations freely. Administrators are paralysed by their own bureaucracy. The middle managers, who once gloried in their status, are, as a European study reveals, losing their conviction.
Meanwhile, the business corporations and public institutions in which these people work are slimming. The panaceas of decentralised decision-making, increasing skills and performance-related rewards have not succeeded in winning commitment from employees. In Britain, only 8 per cent of employees 'are strongly of the view that their values and those of their organisations are very similar'.
I have embarked on an investigation of a wide range of occupations, one by one, to see how each shapes and sometimes destroys those in it. I have studied how the notion of what humans are capable of has been expanded in different civilisations, and how courage can be manufactured. I have applied my method to the major preoccupations of our time - happiness, love, friendship and respect.
Having looked at those areas, I am now focusing on the search for more satisfying ways of earning a living. There is no shortage of experts devoting themselves to prolonging the life and increasing the income of corporations and institutions. But auditing our finances is not enough: we need to make an audit of ourselves as human beings too, and discover with what sort of people we want to spend our lives.
How many of us can say that we are fully alive at work? How many of us are really part-time slaves - theoretically having the right to escape from our drudgery, but in reality virtual prisoners of our qualifications and careers, used as instruments by others, working not so that we might become better people, but because we can see no other option?
Take hotel workers as an example, since 10 per cent of the working population is now in the 'hospitality industry'. The amount of unused potential is unbelievable. Many highly intelligent and lively people put up with low prestige, low salaries and long hours.
This is because there has been no serious rethinking of what a hotel is since the days of the Ritz, with its nineteenth-century idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place where travellers sleep, but a United Nations in miniature. People from all over the world meet at hotels, though they usually pass each other in silence.
A large proportion of hotel staff are foreigners too, keen to learn a new language and discover a new civilisation, but they have the most superficial relations with their guests. Hotels could be cultural centres, active intermediaries between the guest and the city, genuine hosts bringing together people who have not met. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the many students they employ, instead of giving them only menial tasks.
If they paid closer attention to their staff's deepest ambitions, they would realise that there were many other services that hotels could provide. But they are restrained by the accountants, who say that firms, in order to maximise their profits, should concentrate on one core activity.
The time has come to rethink what this term denotes - from a human, not just a financial angle - and to move on from traditional categorisations. For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people are not content with relations based on obedience, and regard work as an assertion of independence or temperament, they must be given a chance to design their own jobs, and choose their own colleagues, even their customers, within the limits of practicality and profitability.
This means that they have to know how to converse across the boundaries of professional jargon, with minds that may at first seem quite alien. Everybody is clear about the importance of communication, but it is a very different thing from conversation, and traditional conversation is very different from the new kind of conversation which people feel the lack of today.
This is a more intimate encounter, which creates a bond of respect between the participants, and is valued as a way of getting inside another person's skin, with the likelihood that one will be changed by the experience. It is more than a relaxation, because it is the most effective means of establishing equality. Every time you have a conversation which achieves that, the world is changed by a minute amount.",C2,"Theodore Zeldin thinks about work. How can work change?

Do you feel good at your job? Many people do not feel happy at work. They want more. They want to feel good about what they do.

Work should help you be a better person. It should help you learn new things and meet new people. Work should be good for your life.

But many jobs are not like this. For example, doctors feel a lot of stress. Accountants worry about doing the right thing. Many people in offices feel stuck.

Companies want to make money. But workers want more. They want to feel that their work is important.

Theodore Zeldin looks at many jobs. He wants to see how work can be better. He thinks work should help people be happy and have good friends.

How many people feel happy at work? Many people feel like they have to work. They do not have another choice.

Think about people who work in hotels. Many are smart and friendly. But their jobs are often not good. They work long hours for little money.

Hotels can be more than a place to sleep. They can be a place where people from different countries meet and talk. Hotel workers can help guests learn about the city and meet new people.

Work is like a relationship between people. People want to choose what they do and who they work with. They want to talk to others and understand them.

Talking is important. Good talking helps people understand each other. It can make the world a little better.",,"Theodore Zeldin thinks about how our jobs could be different.

Do you feel that people respect and value you enough? Being successful in your job is not the only important thing now. People in many jobs feel that others don't understand or appreciate their work. Even famous people are sometimes unhappy. Before, if you loved your job, you were lucky. But now you need to think about what your job does to you as a person. How does it change your mind, your character, and your relationships with others?

This is very important. You might have great skills, but if your job makes you boring, or if you can't talk to people who do different work, or if you are always busy with small details and have no time to think about bigger ideas or be creative, then no amount of money or a good job title will make you a happy person.

To help with this, I want to find out how work can make us feel happy and complete. Work should not just use us for business. It should be changed to fit all people, women and men. Work should not only be about making money. It should be a good way to live, help us find new talents, and meet different kinds of people.

But changing work does not just mean giving jobs to everyone who is unemployed. This is too simple. When people are more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and make life better. We should think of our working life as a kind of art, with the happy person at the center.

Even good jobs like being a doctor or an accountant are not as good as they used to be. Doctors are often very stressed. Accountants worry if their job is always right. Most architects cannot be as creative as they want. Managers feel stuck by rules. A study in Europe shows that middle managers are losing confidence in their jobs.

At the same time, the companies and organizations where these people work are getting smaller. Ideas like letting workers make more decisions, teaching them new skills, or paying them for good work have not made employees feel more connected to their company. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their personal values are the same as their company's values.

I am studying many different jobs to see how they change the people who do them, sometimes in a bad way. I have looked at how different cultures have different ideas about what people can do, and how people can become brave. I have used this way of thinking to look at important parts of life like happiness, love, friendship, and respect.

Now, I am looking for better ways to earn money. There are many experts who help companies live longer and make more money. But checking our money is not enough. We also need to check ourselves as people. We need to think about what kind of people we want to be and who we want to spend our time with.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us are like part-time slaves? We think we can leave our boring jobs, but really we feel trapped by our education and careers. We are used by other people. We work not to become better, but because we don't know what else to do.

Let's think about hotel workers. Ten percent of workers now work in hotels. There is so much talent that is not used. Many very smart and friendly people work for low pay and long hours.

This is because nobody has really thought about what a hotel could be since a long time ago. A hotel is not just a place to sleep. It is like a small United Nations. People from all over the world stay in hotels, but they usually don't talk to each other.

Many hotel workers are also from other countries. They want to learn a new language and learn about a new culture, but they don't have deep conversations with the guests. Hotels could be places of culture. They could help guests learn about the city. They could bring people together. Hotel managers could use the knowledge of the students who work for them, instead of only giving them boring jobs.

If hotel managers listened to what their workers really want, they would see that hotels could offer many new services. But the people who manage the money say that to make the most profit, a company should only do one main thing.

It is time to think again about what work means - from a human point of view, not just a money point of view. We need to move past old ideas about jobs. For me, work is a relationship. Many people today don't want a relationship where they just obey. They see work as a way to be independent and be themselves. They should have a chance to design their own jobs and choose who they work with, and even who their customers are, if it is possible and makes money.

This means that people need to know how to talk to others who are different from them, even if they use different words. Everyone knows that communication is important, but it is not the same as conversation. And normal conversation is different from the new kind of conversation that people need today.

This new conversation is more personal. It creates respect between people. It is a way to really understand another person, and you might change because of it. It is more than just relaxing. It is the best way to make people feel equal. Every time you have a conversation like this, you change the world a little bit.","Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working lives could change.

Do you feel respected and valued as you should? Being successful in your career is no longer enough. People in every profession feel they are not properly appreciated or understood. Even famous people are often unhappy despite their success. Until recently, if you loved your job, you were lucky. But now you need to ask what your job is doing to you as a person—to your mind, character, and relationships.

This is very important. No matter how good you are at your job, if it makes you boring, if you can't talk to people outside your field, or if you're so busy with small details that you have no time to grow as a person or use your imagination, then no amount of money or status can make up for it.

To change this, I want to find out how work can focus first on helping us grow as people—not just using us for business goals. Work should not only be about making money. It should be a meaningful way of life, helping us discover new talents and meet different kinds of people.

However, this change doesn't mean ending unemployment. That goal is too simple. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting, useful, and improve their lives. A working life should be like a work of art, with the person at the center.

Even middle-class jobs like being a doctor, accountant, or architect no longer feel as freeing as they used to. Doctors are often stressed, accountants worry about ethics, and architects rarely get to be creative. Managers feel trapped by rules and paperwork.

At the same time, companies and institutions are getting smaller. Ideas like letting employees make more decisions or paying them based on performance haven't made workers feel more connected to their jobs. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match their company's values.

I have studied many different jobs to see how they affect people. I've looked at how different cultures have expanded what humans can do and how people find courage. I've also studied happiness, love, friendship, and respect.

Now, I'm looking for more satisfying ways to earn a living. There are many experts helping companies live longer and earn more money. But checking our finances isn't enough—we also need to check our lives as human beings and decide what kind of people we want to be with.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves—free in theory, but trapped by our careers? We often work not to improve ourselves, but because we see no other choice.

Let's take hotel workers as an example. Ten percent of workers are in the hospitality industry. There is so much wasted talent. Many smart and energetic people accept low pay, little respect, and long hours.

This is because no one has really rethought what a hotel should be since the luxury hotels of the 19th century. A hotel isn't just a place to sleep—it's like a small United Nations. People from all over the world meet there, but they usually ignore each other.

Do you feel you receive the respect and recognition you deserve? Career success alone is no longer enough. Every profession now argues that it is not properly valued or understood, and even successful individuals often feel dissatisfied despite their achievements. Until recently, loving your job made you part of an enviable group. Now, however, you need to consider what your work is doing to you as a person—to your mind, character, and relationships.

This question is essential. No matter how skilled you are, if your job makes you boring, unable to talk to people outside your field, or so focused on small details that you have no time for wisdom, imagination, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for your shortcomings as a complete person.

To address this, I am exploring how work could make fulfilling these personal goals its main aim—instead of treating people as tools for industrial purposes—and how jobs could be redesigned to suit everyone, women and men alike. Work should not just be a way to make money, but a valuable way of life: a path to a more meaningful existence, to discovering hidden talents, and to forming a wider range of human connections.

However, this change would not mean simply ending unemployment. That goal is too simple, because as people become more educated, they expect jobs that improve their lives, are interesting, and are useful. A working life should be seen as a kind of personal creation, with the fulfilled individual at its center.

Solutions like decentralized decision-making, improving skills, and linking pay to performance have not made employees feel more committed. In Britain, only 8% of workers strongly believe that their personal values match those of their organization.

I have started a detailed study of many different jobs, one by one, to see how each one shapes—and sometimes harms—the people in them. I have looked at how different societies have expanded their ideas of what people can achieve, and how courage can be developed. I have used this approach to study key concerns of our time: happiness, love, friendship, and respect.

After examining these areas, I am now focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. There are plenty of experts working to help companies live longer and earn more money.

273,"Screen Learning

A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. 'I'm a little dinosaur,' he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme, so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not a lot.
There is a modish rush to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning via a screen a good method? One writer tells how he tried out an interactive programme with his son. The father diligently read the words while the son fiddled with the pictures. 'Had he spent ten minutes in front of a book, he might possibly have learned something,' said his father.
Television, as my son and his noodles demonstrate, is an impressionistic, suggestive medium. Research about television and learning shows that learning goes on in a learning environment where dialogue is taking place with teachers or parents. It needs to be mediated. There is nothing wrong with harnessing new technology to teach our children, but there is still a big role for formal education.

Hollywood

By 1918, four-fifths of the film-making capacity of the world had relocated to Hollywood. Locals disapproved, seeing their suburb of Los Angeles infected by these new vulgarians. But in the end snobbery yielded to the true American value, success. And success is the box-office gross. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: one that may make a star, but must make somebody's fortune.
In less than a century, Hollywood has grown from a toffee-nosed village to a town as famous as New York, Rome or Paris. And physically, of course, it has changed beyond recognition: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet in a way, it is still a village - parochial, with limited horizons - just a little bit of Los Angeles. For all who live and work in it, there is one topic of conversation - films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who's been stabbed in the back, who is 'attached' to which project. Those who have been successful often try to get away: to work there, but live somewhere else. Yet it is still the one place in the world to which almost everyone who is anyone in show-business (and plenty who agent) eventually gravitates.

Photography

Photography was invented by nineteenth century artists as an art form for their own purposes. These men were seeking a lasting, literal record of their visual surroundings and they found it. The new combination of illumination, lens, shutter, and flat surface coated with chemicals sensitive to light produced images more lasting, more convincing in their reality, and more richly detailed than painters could produce manually in weeks and months of effort. This alone was enough to throw consternation into the ranks of fellow artists; and, after their first reaction of pleasure in a new kind of image, art critics rallied with the haughty charge that photography was not, and could not be, an art. The actual world in which we live had too strong a grip on photography, they said, and pictures so dependent upon mechanical means could not be called acts of man's creative imagination.
Despite the critics, photographers knew that they had found a new art form, a new mode of expression. They used the new tools as other artists before and after them have used brush and pencil - to interpret the world, to present a vision of nature and its structure as well as the things and the people in it.

Book Illustration

During the black-and-white era of book illustration it was axiomatic that each and every children's book called for some form of illustration. This extended to the large category of novels for the upper reading ages, which was to suffer progressive attrition as print runs shortened. The level of activity in all areas of children's publishing remained considerable, but it was run predominantly as a low-budget operation for most of the period and as such encouraged a fair amount of routine and mediocre work, although the finest artists seldom submitted less than their professional best. Therefore, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house, a wonderful place for research or for browsing, and one in which to make immediate finds or to begin to re-evaluate a fertile artistic period. The real treasures are bound to return to public display, whether enduringly through reissues of individual titles and new publications about the artists who illustrated them - or from time to time in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after a period of neglect, this is starting to happen and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be seen to be at work. In due course, an enterprising publisher will doubtlessly see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period either in facsimile reprint, or in freshly-designed editions using the original artwork where it survives.
",C2,,"**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look scary. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was copying something he saw on a TV show. So I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs. He didn't know very much.

Many people are excited about learning from the internet and computers. But is learning from a screen a good way to learn? One man wrote about using a learning program with his son. The father read the words, but the son just played with the pictures. The father said, ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something.""

Television, like my son and his noodles show, gives you ideas and feelings. Studies say that children learn best when they talk with a teacher or a parent. Learning needs this help. It's good to use new technology to teach children, but school and teachers are still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's movies were made in Hollywood. At first, people who lived there did not like the movie makers. They thought these new people were not very nice. But in the end, they accepted them because they were successful. In America, success is very important. For Hollywood, a good film is a film that makes a lot of money.

In less than one hundred years, Hollywood changed from a small village to a famous town. It is now as famous as New York or Paris. The place looks very different now. One hundred years ago, you could walk through orange trees to the village shop. But in some ways, it is still like a small village. People there only talk about one thing: films. They talk about how much money a film made, or which famous people are dating. Many successful people try to live outside of Hollywood, but they still work there. It is the place where most famous people in movies want to be.

**Photography**

Artists invented photography in the 1800s. They wanted to make a true and lasting picture of the world around them. They found a way to do it. They used light, a lens, a shutter, and special paper. This made pictures that were very real and full of detail. A painter would need many weeks or months to make a picture like that.

This new way of making pictures worried other artists. At first, art critics liked the new pictures. But then they said that photography was not real art. They said that because a machine helps to make the picture, it is not from a person's imagination.

But photographers knew they had a new art. They used their cameras like painters use a brush. They used it to show the world and their ideas about it.

**Book Illustration**

A long time ago, most books for children had pictures in black and white. People thought that every children's book needed pictures. This was also true for many books for older children. Later, fewer of these books were made.

Making children's books was a big business, but it did not use a lot of money. Because of this, many of the pictures were not very special. But the best artists always made very good pictures.

So, the collection of old black-and-white pictures is like a shop with some bad things and some very good things. It is a fun place to look and learn. You can find great pictures quickly. The best pictures will become popular again. They will be in new books or in art shows. After people forgot about them for a while, these pictures are becoming popular again. Soon, a smart book company will probably make new books with these classic children's book pictures.","**Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and trying to look scary. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was copying something he saw on a TV show. So I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs. He didn't know very much.

Many people are excited about using the internet and computers for learning. But is learning from a screen a good way to learn? One writer tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words carefully, but the son just played with the pictures. The father said, ""If he had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something.""

Television, as my son showed, gives you ideas and feelings. Studies show that children learn best when they can talk with teachers or parents. Learning needs this kind of help. It's good to use new technology to teach children, but schools and teachers are still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. At first, local people did not like this. They thought these new film-makers were not very nice. But in the end, they accepted them because they were successful. In Hollywood, a good film is one that makes a lot of money.

In less than one hundred years, Hollywood grew from a small village to a famous town like New York or Paris. The place has changed a lot. A hundred years ago, you would walk through orange trees to go to the shop. But in some ways, it is still like a small town. People who live and work there only talk about films: how much money they make, who is in love with whom, and who has problems. Successful people often try to live somewhere else, but they still work there. Hollywood is still the main place for almost everyone in the movie business.

**Photography**

Artists in the nineteenth century invented photography as a new art form. They wanted to make a true and lasting picture of the world around them, and they did. Using light, a lens, a shutter, and special paper, they could create images. These pictures were more real and detailed than paintings, and they took much less time to make. This made other artists worried. At first, art critics liked the new images, but soon they said that photography was not real art. They said that because it used a machine, it could not be a creative work from a person's imagination.

But photographers knew they had a new art form. They used their cameras like other artists use a brush or a pencil. They used them to show the world and their own vision of it.

**Book Illustration**

When most book illustrations were in black and white, people believed that every children's book needed pictures. This included many books for older children. Later, fewer of these books were printed. Even though many children's books were published, they were often made with very little money. Because of this, many of the illustrations were not very good, although the best artists always did their best work.

So, the collection of old black-and-white illustrations is a mix of bad and very good work. It is a great place to look for interesting pictures or to learn about art from that time. The best illustrations will become popular again. They will be printed in new books or shown in exhibitions. After being forgotten for a while, this is starting to happen. Soon, a smart publisher will probably make new books using these classic children's book illustrations.",,"Screen-Based Learning

Recently, I observed my six-year-old son eating noodles in an unusual manner. He was lifting them with his teeth while attempting to appear menacing. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he explained. He was reenacting a scene from a television programme he had recently watched, so I questioned him about his knowledge of dinosaurs. His response revealed that he had retained very little information.

There is currently a fashionable trend towards embracing internet and computer-based learning, yet the effectiveness of screen-based education remains questionable. One author recounts his experience with an interactive programme he used with his son. While the father conscientiously read the text, his son merely manipulated the images. ""Had he devoted ten minutes to reading a book, he might actually have acquired some knowledge,"" the father remarked.

Television, as demonstrated by my son's noodle-eating performance, operates as an impressionistic medium that suggests rather than substantively educates. Research into television and learning indicates that effective learning occurs within an environment where dialogue takes place between students and teachers or parents. Such learning requires mediation. While there is nothing inherently wrong with utilizing new technologies to educate children, formal education continues to play a crucial role.

Hollywood

By 1918, approximately four-fifths of global film production capacity had shifted to Hollywood. Local residents initially disapproved, perceiving their Los Angeles suburb as contaminated by these new arrivals whom they considered vulgar. However, this snobbery ultimately gave way to the quintessential American value: success, as measured by box office revenue. Hollywood recognizes a successful film when it sees one - a production that might create a star, but must inevitably generate substantial profits.

Within less than a century, Hollywood has transformed from an exclusive village into a town as internationally renowned as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, the area has changed beyond recognition: a century ago, one would walk through orange groves to reach the village store. Paradoxically, it remains somewhat parochial in outlook - merely a district of Los Angeles. For those who live and work there, conversation revolves exclusively around films: their financial performance, romantic relationships between stars, professional betrayals, and casting decisions. Successful individuals often attempt to maintain their professional involvement while residing elsewhere. Nevertheless, Hollywood continues to be the primary destination for virtually everyone of significance in the entertainment industry.

Photography

Photography emerged in the nineteenth century as an artistic medium developed by artists for their own creative purposes. These practitioners sought to create enduring, accurate representations of their visual environment, and they succeeded. The innovative combination of illumination, lens, shutter, and light-sensitive chemicals produced images that were more permanent, more convincingly realistic, and more intricately detailed than anything painters could achieve through weeks or months of manual labor. This capability alone caused considerable consternation among other artists. Following their initial appreciation of this new visual form, art critics responded with the condescending assertion that photography could not be considered art. They argued that photography was too constrained by literal representation and that images so dependent on mechanical processes could not embody human creative imagination.

Despite such criticism, photographers recognized they had discovered a new artistic form and mode of expression. They employed their new tools as artists throughout history have used brushes and pencils - to interpret the world, presenting their unique vision of nature, its structure, and its inhabitants.

Book Illustration

During the era of black-and-white book illustration, it was universally accepted that every children's book required some form of illustration. This practice extended to the substantial category of novels for older children, though this segment would gradually diminish as print runs decreased. Throughout most of this period, children's publishing maintained considerable activity across all areas, though it typically operated as a low-budget enterprise. This economic reality encouraged a significant amount of routine and mediocre work, although accomplished artists rarely delivered anything less than their professional best. Consequently, the archive of black-and-white illustrations represents both a repository of treasures and a collection of lesser works - an excellent resource for research or casual browsing, offering both immediate discoveries and opportunities to reassess a productive artistic era. The most valuable works inevitably resurface publicly, either through enduring reissues of individual titles and publications about the illustrators, or periodically through exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are indications that, following a period of neglect, this revival is commencing, with the familiar processes of stylistic reappraisal becoming evident. Eventually, some enterprising publisher will undoubtedly recognize the potential for a series featuring classic children's book illustrations from this period, whether through facsimile reprints or newly designed editions utilizing surviving original artwork.",

Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner's point of view.

Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. There are deadlines, there are restrictions, normally quite severe, on their length; and when published they claim houseroom only for as long as the newspaper they are printed in - a day or a week, at most a month. Moreover, the literary status of reviews tends to be settled by their ephemerality. It is usually supposed, not only by the public but, quite often, by the writers themselves, that reviewing is work that nobody would do if there weren't some reason -- shortage of cash would he cited most often, though another good reason is that you can't work all day on a novel or a 'serious'
book of any sort - which prevents them from occupying their time with something more valuable.
Yet reviewing is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to be bright, brisk and summarily fair in the six or eight hundred words of an ordinary newspaper review, quite another to control, without looseness of argument, the six or eight thousand words sometimes allowed by international journals. And the fifteen hundred words of a leading piece in the weekly magazines present some of the problems of both short and long. Not that length is the only consideration. For one thing, the reviewer obviously needs to think about the probable audience, the weekend skimmer at one end of the scale, the person already interested enough in the subject to tackle a serious review-article at the other. Finally, a reviewer needs to know quite a bit about quite a number of things; and must be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. It follows almost infallibly that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.
The American novelist Johh Updike, who rather looks down on criticism -- 'hugging the shore' he calls it - nevertheless enjoys some coastal reviewing in the intervals between his transoceanic novel-writing. Understandably reluctant to allow even his less ambitious voyages to go without any permanent record, he gathers together his every review, however short, into volumes with mildly self-deprecating titles. It might be thought that lesser persons should accept ephemerality as the penalty appropriate to their coastal caution, but it is hand to see why, if they can get away with it, they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the measure of permanence, and the measure of vanity, proper to their station, especially if they believe that some of their best writing has been 'buried' in reviews. I admit to feeling this about my own work.
My own principal occupation has been academic, and most of my 'serious' books are recognisably academic products, the sort of thing professors like, and are expected to do as part of their jobs. However, the English-speaking world (I think fortunately) acknowledges nothing comparable to the sharp distinction people from other cultures make between reviewing and literary study -- and so with us it is quite usual for the same people to do both. The days are gone when other academics reviled reviewer-professors for unseemly self-display, or waste of academic time, or betrayal of the dignity of their institutions. And complaints from non-professors, to the effect that the professors are taking the bread out of their mouths, are also less common than they were, partly because there is so much more reviewing nowadays that practically everyone can have some, partly, no doubt, because the bread is often such a meagre ration.
My own view is that these arrangements are good for both readers -- since they can be fairly certain the reviewer has at least some idea what he is talking about -- and professors, if only because the work helps to keep them sane. It also reminds them that they have a duty, easily neglected, to make themselves intelligible to non-professors. When talking among themselves they may feel some need to be impressively arcane, but when addressing intelligent non-professors they need to make sure they are communicating effectively.
Finally, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, and despite all that can be said to dignify it, reviewing must be a secondary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough. ",C2,,"Writing Reviews

Frank Kermode writes about how to write reviews. He has written many reviews himself.

Most reviews are written quickly and are not read for a long time. They are often short because newspapers and magazines only give a little space. People read them for a day, a week, or maybe a month, and then forget them. Many people think that writing reviews is not very important work. They think writers only do it to make money or when they need a break from writing bigger books.

But writing a good review is not easy. It is a skill. A short review for a newspaper is different from a long review for a special magazine. A writer must think about who will read the review. Some readers want a quick summary. Other readers want more details. A reviewer must know about many things and must write in a way that is easy for people to understand. Because of this, most people who write reviews also write other things, like books.

The famous American writer John Updike sometimes wrote reviews between writing his big novels. He collected his reviews into books. Some people might think that short reviews should be forgotten, but if a writer is proud of their work, why shouldn't they save it? I feel this way about my own reviews.

My main job has been as a university teacher. I have written serious books for other teachers. In the English-speaking world, it is normal for teachers to also write reviews. In the past, some people did not like this. They thought teachers should not write for newspapers. But now this happens a lot, and there are many reviews for everyone to write.

I think this is good for everyone. Readers can trust that the reviewer knows about the topic. For teachers, it is good because it helps them stay connected to the real world. It reminds them to write clearly so that people who are not teachers can understand them. When teachers talk to each other, they sometimes use difficult words. But when they write for everyone, they need to be clear.

In the end, reviewing is a job you do on the side. You can only be a good reviewer if you are also good at another, bigger job.","Writing Reviews

Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from the point of view of someone who writes them.

Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have short deadlines and must not be too long. When they are printed in a newspaper or magazine, people only read them for a short time—a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, many people think reviews are not very important. Often, people believe that writers only write reviews because they need money, or because they cannot work on a bigger book all the time.

But writing a good review is a skill. It is one thing to write a short review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper. It is another to write a much longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for a serious magazine. A review of 1,500 words for a weekly magazine has its own challenges too. Of course, length is not the only thing to think about. The writer must also think about the reader. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed review. A reviewer needs to know about many things and must write in a way that is clear and interesting for intelligent people. Because of this, most reviewers also write other things, not just reviews.

The American writer John Updike does not think very highly of criticism. He calls it ""hugging the shore."" Still, he writes reviews between working on his big novels. He likes to collect his reviews into books, even the short ones, so they are not forgotten. Maybe other, less famous writers should also be able to keep their reviews in books, especially if they think some of their best writing is in those reviews. I feel this way about my own review writing.

My main job has been as a university teacher. Most of my serious books are academic—the kind that professors write. In English-speaking countries, people do not make a big difference between writing reviews and doing academic work. The same people often do both. In the past, other professors would criticize professor-reviewers for showing off or wasting time. But this does not happen much now. Also, other writers used to complain that professors were taking their work, but this is also less common. There are more reviews to write now, so many people can do it, and the pay is often not very high.

I think this situation is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows something about the subject. It is also good for professors because it helps them stay connected to the real world. It reminds them to write in a way that everyone can understand, not just other professors. When they talk to other professors, they might use difficult language, but when they write for everyone, they need to be clear.

In the end, it is clear that reviewing must be a second job. You can only do it well if you are also good at doing something else.","Writing Reviews

Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from the point of view of someone who writes them.

Most reviews are written and published in a way that means they are only read for a short time. There are time limits and strict rules about how long they can be. When they are printed in a newspaper or magazine, they are usually only read for a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, people often think that reviews are not very important. It is commonly believed, by both the public and the writers themselves, that people only write reviews if they have to. The most common reason given is a need for money. Another reason is that you cannot work on a serious book all day long. People think that if they had the choice, they would spend their time on more valuable work.

However, writing reviews is a skilled job that requires different abilities. It is one thing to write a short, clear, and fair review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper. It is another thing to write a much longer review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal, where you must still present a strong argument. Writing a fifteen-hundred-word main article for a weekly magazine has its own challenges, combining aspects of both short and long reviews. The length is not the only important thing. The reviewer also needs to think about who will read the review. This could be someone who just reads it quickly at the weekend, or someone who is already very interested in the subject. Finally, a reviewer needs to know about many different things and must be able to write in a way that intelligent people can easily understand and enjoy. This almost always means that the reviewer is also a person who writes other things, not just reviews.

The American novelist John Updike, who does not think very highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between working on his major novels. He does not want even his smaller pieces of writing to be forgotten, so he collects all his reviews into books, even though he gives them titles that suggest they are not very important. You might think that less famous writers should accept that their work will be quickly forgotten. But if they can, why shouldn't they also have a chance for their work to last longer and feel proud of it? This is especially true if they believe that some of their best writing is hidden inside their reviews. I feel this way about my own review writing.

My main job has been as a university teacher. Most of my serious books are academic, the kind that professors are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, the line between writing reviews and doing academic literary study is not very sharp. It is quite normal for the same people to do both. In the past, other academics would criticize professor-reviewers for showing off, wasting time, or not acting in a way that was suitable for their university position. Complaints from non-professors, saying that professors were taking work away from them, were also more common. These complaints are less frequent now, partly because there are so many more reviews to write that almost everyone can do some, and partly because the pay for a review is often very small.

I believe that this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can be fairly sure that the reviewer knows something about the subject. For professors, writing reviews helps them stay connected to the real world. It also reminds them of their duty to write in a way that people who are not professors can understand. When talking to each other, professors might use very complex language to sound impressive. But when writing for intelligent people who are not professors, they need to make sure they are communicating clearly.

In the end, it is clear that for many reasons, reviewing must be a secondary job. You can only do it well enough if you are also doing something else well.",,
275,"Sand

Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete, I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. When you are wet it adheres to you like 'stucco', and cannot be shifted, even with a fireman's hose. But, and here's the strange thing, the moment you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, it pours off you. For days afterwards, you tip mysteriously undiminishing piles of it onto the floor every time you take on your shoes, and spray the vicinity with lots more when you peel off your socks. Sand stays with you for longer than many contagious diseases. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

Lock and Key

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed ever since human beings first built a permanent homestead. The rope-lifted beam behind the door may have given way to an electronic lock triggered by a plastic card with more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, but the urge to shut out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is, to some extent, psychological. Recently, various companies have experimented with computerised locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks by means of a digital command. But people don't like them. You may be prepared to put up with it at work, but at home, everyone wants the reassurance of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure they incorporated a proper metal key into the device.

Modern Art

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery as, like many people, I can make head nor tail of modern art. I know I quite like some of it, furry things in particular, neon light sculptures and massive photographs. Perhaps if I were better informed about it, I'd have an opinion on more things. There again, yours not meant to set about it in a school-essay way. The point is not to grasp art, but to let it communicate with you. This is a splendid idea but one that never worked for me in practice. But this new gallery has tried to give the visitor a genuine insight into the whys and wherefores of the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that set a work in context and actually told you what it was trying to say. Instead of staring blankly at the pictures as I used to, these nuggets of information helped me understand.",C2,,"**Sand**

I think it is good that sand can become useful things like glass and concrete. But I do not like sand on the beach. For me, it is a problem between the car park and the sea. It blows in your face, gets in your food, and you lose things like keys and money in it. When you are wet, the sand sticks to you and is hard to get off. But when you stand on a towel or get in a car, the sand falls off you. For many days, sand falls out of your shoes and socks. It stays with you for a long time. So, I do not want sand.

People always want a safe home. A long time ago, people used a piece of wood to lock a door. Now, we have new locks that use a plastic card. But people still want to stop bad people from coming in. A lock and key makes people feel safe. Some companies made new locks that use a special card. But people did not like them. You might use these at work, but at home, people want to use a real key. So, one company made a new lock with a card, but they also put a real key on it.

I felt a little worried about going to the new Tate Modern gallery. Like many people, I do not understand modern art. I know I like some things, like soft things, bright lights, and very big photos. If I knew more about art, maybe I would like more things. But you do not need to think about it like school work. The idea is to feel something from the art, not to understand it. This is a good idea, but it did not work for me. This new gallery helps people understand the art. I saw the words next to the art. Good words tell you about the art and what it means. Before, I looked at pictures and did not understand. Now, the words helped me.","**Sand**

It blows into your face, gets into your food, and you can lose small but important things like car keys in it. When you are wet, the sand sticks to your skin and it is very hard to wash off. But the strange thing is, as soon as you stand on a towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off you. For days after, every time you take off your shoes, sand falls onto the floor. It seems like there is always more sand in your shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a very long time. No, I think I can live without sand.

Liking a lock and key is partly a feeling in your mind. Recently, some companies have tried new computer locking systems. You use a smart card in a machine to open an electronic lock. But people don't really like these systems. You might use one at work, but at home, everyone likes the feeling of turning a real key in a lock.

But you are not supposed to study it like you do for a school project. The idea is not to completely understand the art, but to let the art talk to you. I think this is a great idea, but it has never really worked for me. However, this new gallery has tried to help visitors really understand why the art was made and what it means. The first thing I saw were the information signs. They were good signs that explained the situation when the art was made and told you what the artist wanted to say. Before, I used to just look at the pictures without understanding. Now, these small pieces of information helped me understand them.","Sand

276,"Observing Lions

In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case, their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild, we have acquired a less exalted view. 
When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt, rear cubs and among other things, scare off rivals with chorused roars. If the ultimate success of an animals behaviour is measured by its lifetime production of surviving offspring, then cooperation does not necessarily pay: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. Why, then, did not the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?
We confidently assumed that we would be able to resolve that issue in two to three years. But lions are supremely adept at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases, including krypton, argon and neon, we would add lion. Thus it has taken a variety of research measures to uncover clues about the cats behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear. 

Pop Music Review

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a landmark in the career of a talented but hitherto precarious band. New Life launched a movement that effectively redesigned the specification of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Out went the earnest angst, plain-shirted drabness and overdriven guitars of a previous era; in came a lighter blend of melodious homegrown styles. A mix of social observation and strident anger mingled easily here with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were well to the fore, as were the voices that felt no need to disguise their origins.
The album showed Bedrock to be skilful magpie collectors and observers, and a cunningly versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they went larkily after traditional English preoccupations such as sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength lay in the gentle melancholy depths it plumbed on tracks such as 'So Low', a gorgeous unfurling tune loosely hung around the theme of meteorology, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that allowed no smirking at the back. The beauty of New Life is its consistently sky-high quality - 16 tracks with absolutely no filler remains an unsurpassed record in the era of loiteringly long CDs.

Extract from an autobiography

As a child I was always fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', those mysteriously wise women who wielded such influence in the ancient world. To begin with, I only knew of the existence of one who appeared in a tale my mother had told me. An old woman of Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused and she burnt three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused, she again burnt three books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. 
I realised even then that there was a profound truth hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and in life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I used to ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson that I've never forgotten.
When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to look for something that I could bear to find out about, something that was relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveller - at the first opportunity I sent my editor a very long list of places I wasn't prepared to go to. When it comes down to it, I'm only interested in ruins, because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

What becomes of your manuscript?

When you submit your manuscript it will most likely join a heap waiting for someone to sort and sift before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. The someone is usually either the editorial department junior (i.e. under 18) or an old hand who comes in a couple of mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of these has much influence, but they are basically on your side and out to discover something original - the junior to make his or her name and acquire an author of their own if they are lucky, the old hand to justify continuing freelance employment.
If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it on to a more senior editor and eventually it will surface at an acquisition meeting. The championing editor will not only have to justify accepting your novel on the grounds of intrinsic merit and potential sales, but also say whether you as an author seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Also the question is raised of how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. To this end, publishers often like to meet a potential author before clinching the offer.",C2,,,"**Watching Lions**

Many people think that lions hunting for food are like a perfect group dance. At sunset, a group of quiet lions jumps from the shadows and surrounds an animal that doesn't see them. Lions seem like the perfect social animals. They work together without fighting to reach a goal—their next meal. But after watching them in the wild for many years, we now see things differently.

We began our study in 1978. We wanted to learn why lions work together to hunt, raise their young, and scare away other lions with loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many children it has, then being too helpful can be a problem. A very generous animal helps others, but it might not help itself. So why don't the rules of evolution, which say animals should be selfish, seem to work for lions?

We thought we could answer this question in two or three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. They are as inactive as gases like krypton or neon. Because of this, we needed to use many different research methods to understand their behavior. Wild lions can live for 18 years, so we are only now starting to find the answers.

**Pop Music Review**

Bedrock's third album was not just important for the band. ""New Life"" started a new style that changed rock music in this country for ten years. It moved away from the serious, sad feelings and loud guitars of the past. Instead, it used lighter, more melodic sounds from local music. The songs mixed social comments and strong feelings with the sounds of fairground organs and brass bands. The album used a lot of humor and singers who kept their local accents.

The album showed that Bedrock were clever at collecting ideas and writing songs. Some songs were playful and about typical English things like sunbathing or Sunday afternoons. But the best songs were the sad ones, like ""So Low,"" which is about the weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious love song. The great thing about ""New Life"" is that all 16 songs are very good—there are no bad ones. This is rare for a long CD.

**Story from a Life**

When I was a child, I loved stories about ""The Sibyl."" These were very wise women who were important in ancient times. At first, I only knew one story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered the King of Rome nine books for 300 gold coins. He said no, so she burned three books and offered six for the same price. He refused again, and she burned three more. Finally, he bought the last three books for the full 300 gold coins.

Even as a child, I understood there was an important lesson in this story—about selling things and about life. I was sometimes a lonely child. I would ask other children to play, and they would say no. My mother told me to do something so interesting that the other children would ask to join me. It worked. It was a lesson I have always remembered.

When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find a subject that interested me and was important to my life. I don't really like travelling. I quickly sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to visit. The truth is, I am only interested in old ruins, because the travel I enjoy is travelling with my mind through time.

**What Happens to Your Book?**

When you send your book to a publisher, it will probably go into a big pile with many others. This is called the ""slush pile."" A junior worker in the office, or an experienced part-time worker, will look at it. They don't have much power, but they want to find a good new book. The junior worker hopes to find a great writer and become successful. The experienced worker wants to keep their job.

If they think your book is good, they will give it to a senior editor. Later, people at a meeting will decide if they want to publish it. The editor who likes your book must explain why it is good and if it will sell. They will also say if they think you will write more books in the future. Another important question is if you are easy to promote, because a new book needs a lot of help. Because of this, publishers often like to meet a writer before they agree to publish their book.","**Observing Lions**

Many people imagine lions hunting as a perfectly organized group. At sunset, a group of these quiet cats appears from the shadows and surrounds an animal that doesn't see them coming. They look like the perfect social animals, working together without problems to reach a shared goal: their next meal. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, our opinion is less ideal.

We began our research in 1978. We wanted to understand why lions cooperate to hunt, raise their young, and scare away rivals with their loud roars. If an animal's success is measured by how many children it has that survive, then being too cooperative doesn't always help. If one animal is too generous, the others benefit, but it loses out. So why don't the normal rules of evolution and self-interest seem to work for lions?

We were sure we could answer this question in two or three years. But lions are experts at doing nothing. We would add 'lion' to the list of inactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Because of this, we needed many different research methods to find clues about their behaviour. Since wild lions can live for 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was not just an important moment for a talented but previously unstable band. 'New Life' started a movement that changed the sound of rock music in this country for the next ten years. It replaced the serious worry, simple clothes, and loud guitars of the past with a lighter mix of local musical styles. The album combined social comments and strong anger with the sounds of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were very noticeable, as were the singers' voices, which kept their local accents.

The album showed that Bedrock were skilled at collecting ideas and observing things, and they were a clever and adaptable songwriting team. In their most simple songs, they happily explored typical English interests like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real power was in the gentle sadness of songs like 'So Low'—a beautiful, slowly developing song about the weather—and 'To the Brink', a serious ballad. The great thing about 'New Life' is its consistently high quality. Having 16 songs with no weak ones is still an unbeaten record in the age of very long CDs.

**Extract from an autobiography**

As a child, I was always very interested in stories about 'The Sibyl', those mysteriously wise women who had a lot of power in the ancient world. At first, I only knew about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold coins. He said no, so she burned three of them and offered him the remaining six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more books. Finally, he bought the last three books for the full 300 gold coins.

Even then, I understood that there was a deep truth in this story—a lesson about sales and about life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I would ask other children if I could play with them and they would say no. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would ask to join me. It worked. It was another lesson I have always remembered.

When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find a subject that I wanted to learn about, something that was connected to my own life. I am not a keen traveller. As soon as I could, I sent my editor a very long list of places I did not want to visit. The truth is, I am only interested in ruins, because the kind of travel I enjoy is travelling with my mind through time.

**What happens to your manuscript?**

When you send your manuscript to a publisher, it will probably join a large pile waiting for someone to look through it before it falls over. This is called the 'slush pile'. The person who does this is usually either the youngest person in the editorial department or an experienced person who works a few mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of them has much power, but they are generally on your side and are trying to find something new. The junior person hopes to become known and, with luck, find an author of their own. The experienced person wants to keep their freelance job.

If they think your novel is good, they will give it to a more senior editor. Eventually, it will be discussed at a meeting. The editor who supports your book will have to explain why it should be accepted. They will talk about its quality and how many copies it might sell. They will also say if you, as an author, seem likely to write more books in the future (which you should have mentioned in your letter). Another important question is how easy you will be to promote. This is a key factor when a new book needs all the support it can get. Because of this, publishers often like to meet a possible author before they make a final offer.","**Observing Lions**

In popular perception, lions hunting for food demonstrate impressive group coordination: in the fading evening light, a pride of stealthy cats emerges from the shadows like trained assassins, surrounding their unsuspecting prey. Lions appear to be ideal social animals, putting aside individual disagreements to work together towards a common aim—their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have developed a more realistic view.

When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions cooperate in hunting, raising their young, and frightening away rivals with group roars. If the ultimate measure of an animal’s behavioural success is the number of surviving offspring it produces in its lifetime, then cooperation does not always provide an advantage: if an animal is too generous, others may benefit at its cost. So why don’t the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?

We were initially confident that we could answer this question in two to three years. But lions are extremely good at doing very little. To the list of inactive noble gases, such as krypton, argon, and neon, we could easily add lion. As a result, it has taken a variety of research methods to uncover clues about these cats’ behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now coming to light.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock’s third album was more than just a key moment for a talented but previously unsteady band. *New Life* started a movement that effectively redefined the sound of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. The serious anxiety, dull clothing, and distorted guitars of an earlier time disappeared; instead, a lighter mix of melodic local styles appeared. Social observation and strong anger mixed easily with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were very noticeable, as were the singers who did not try to hide their regional accents.

The album showed Bedrock to be skilled collectors and observers, and a cleverly flexible team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they cheerfully explored traditional English interests like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album’s real strength was in the gentle, sad depths it reached in songs such as ‘So Low’, a beautifully unfolding tune loosely based on weather themes, and ‘To the Brink’, a ballad that did not allow any silly reactions. The quality of *New Life* is consistently high—16 tracks with no weak songs remains an unbeaten record in the age of very long CDs.

When you send in your manuscript, it will probably join a pile waiting to be sorted before it falls over—the so-called slush pile.

277,"Enough Sleep?

Tiredness, it is often claimed, has become the modern condition. As the richer, busier countries have grown, so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected, and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists, or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.
Part of this interest is in sleep in general: in its rhythms, its uses and in problems with sleeping. But a central preoccupation remains. 'People need more sleep,' says one leading sleep researcher. 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.'
Recently, a sleep researcher tried an experiment. He offered his subjects the opposite of the modern routine. 'I allowed them to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to reach an equilibrium of eight-and-a-quarter hours. That indicates a great rebound of sleep - sleep that they hadn't been getting!'
In Europe, such propositions are perhaps most thoroughly tested in a small unassuming building on a university campus in the English Midlands. The university sleep research laboratory has investigated, among many subjects, the effects of fatigue on sailors, the effects of airpot noise on sleepers, and the dangers of motorway driving for flagging drivers.
For guinea pigs, they advertise in the student newspapers. Subjects are picked up by taxi, paid PS5 an hour, and asked to adjust their sleeping patterns according to instructions. Dr Louise Reyner provides reassurance: 'Some people are quite worried, because you're putting electrodes on their heads, and they think you can see what they're dreaming or thinking.'
In fact, the laboratory's interest is more physical. In a darkened room stands a motorway simulator, the front section of car facing a wide projection screen. The subjects are always told to arrive at 2pm, in the body's natural mid-afternoon lull, after a short night's sleep or no sleep at all. The projector is switched on and they are asked to drive, while answering questions. An endless road rolls ahead, sunlight glares; and the air is warm.
The young men all deny they are going to fall asleep. Dr Reyner has a video recording of one trying not to. At first the person at the wheel is very upright, wet and bleary eyes determinedly fixed on the windscreen. Then he begins to blink briefly, every now and again; then for longer, and more often, with a slight drop of the head. Each nod grows heavier than the last. The blinks become a 10-second blackout. Every time, he jerks awake as if nothing has happened. But the car, by the second or third occasion, has shot off the carriageway.
A coffee might have helped. Two cups, Dr Reyner says, even after no sleep at all, can make you a safe driver for half an hour or more. She recommends a whole basket of alertness products: tablets, energy drinks, caffeinated chewing gum. Shift workers, she is quite sure, could probably use them.
But apart from these findings, what else do know about human sleep with any kind of certainty? It is known that humans sleep, like other mammals, according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness, from stage one sleep, the shallowest, to stage four, the deepest. When dreams occur, which is usually during the lightest sleep, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids, thus preventing injuries.
Beyond this, certainties blur into theories. It is often suggested, for example, that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.
However, there is a strong degree of certainty among scientists that women seep for half an hour longer than men, and that older people require less sleep, though they don't know why. When asked what sleep is for, some sleep researchers reply in cosmic terms: 'Sleep is a tactic to travel through time without injury.'
Moreover, people may have had different sleep patterns in the past. A history professor has investigated nocturnal British life between 1500 and 1850 and discovered that sleeping routines were very different. People went to bed at nine or ten, then woke up after midnight, after what they called their 'first sleep', stayed awake for an hour, and then had their 'morning sleep'.
The interlude was a haven for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time thieving. The poorest were the greatest beneficiaries of this quiet time, fleetingly freed from the constraints and labours that ruled their day-time existence.
By the 17th century, however, as artificial light became more common, the rich began to switch to the more concentrated, and economically more efficient, mode of recuperation that we follow today. Two centuries later, the industrial revolution pushed back the dusk for everyone except some country-dwellers, by making most people work longer hours in lighted buildings.
Yet beyond Europe and America, the old pattern was widespread until quite recently, and according to a leading anthropologist, in some non-western settings there are still no rigid bedtimes. People go to bed for a few hours, and then get up again. The idea of a night's solid sleep does not apply. For certain tribal societies, human and animal noises and the need to supervise the fire and watch out for predators combine to make continuous sleep impossible. It seems that people all round the world are badly in need of sleep.",C2,,"Do You Get Enough Sleep?

Many people today say they feel tired. In busy countries, more people have problems with sleep and feel worried. In the USA, 40 million people always feel tired. Some popular books in Britain are about people who cannot sleep.

People are interested in sleep. They want to know why we sleep and why some people have sleep problems. One expert says, ""People need more sleep. When they are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to miss the busy traffic.""

A sleep expert did a test. He let people sleep for 14 hours every night for one month. After three weeks, they only needed eight and a quarter hours of sleep. This shows they needed to catch up on lost sleep.

In England, there is a small sleep lab at a university. They study how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired.

The lab finds people for tests through student newspapers. They take them by taxi, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep times. Dr. Louise Reyner says, ""Some people worry because we put wires on their heads. They think we can see their dreams.""

The lab is more interested in the body. In a dark room, there is a car simulator. People sit in the car and watch a big screen. They are told to come at 2 pm, when people often feel sleepy. They drive on the screen and answer questions. The road is long, the sun is bright, and the room is warm.

The young men always say they will not fall asleep. But Dr. Reyner has a video of one man trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight and looks at the road. Then he blinks a lot and his head drops. Soon, he closes his eyes for ten seconds. Each time, he wakes up quickly, but the car has already left the road.

Coffee can help. Dr. Reyner says two cups of coffee can make you a safe driver for half an hour, even with no sleep. She suggests other things to help you stay awake, like pills, energy drinks, and gum with caffeine. She thinks people who work at night could use them.

What else do we know about sleep? We know people sleep every day, like other animals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We dream during light sleep. When we dream, the brain stops the body from moving, so we don't get hurt.

Scientists have ideas about why we sleep. Some think sleep helps fix the body or rest the brain. But they are not sure, because the body may fix itself faster when we are awake but resting.

Scientists are sure that women sleep 30 minutes longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don't know why. When asked why we sleep, one expert said, ""Sleep is a way to pass time safely.""

In the past, people slept differently. A history professor found that between 1500 and 1850, people in Britain went to bed at 9 or 10 pm. They woke up after midnight for an hour, then went back to sleep until morning.

This hour awake was a time to think, remember dreams, or sometimes steal. Poor people liked this quiet time because they were free from their daily work.

By the 1600s, rich people started to sleep all night without waking up, because they had more lights. Two hundred years later, the industrial revolution made most people work longer hours in buildings with lights, so they also slept all night.

Outside of Europe and America, many people had the old sleep pattern until recently. In some places, people still do not sleep all night. They sleep for a few hours, then get up. They cannot sleep for a long time because they need to listen for animals and watch the fire. It seems people everywhere need more sleep.","Are You Getting Enough Sleep?

Many people say that feeling tired is common today. In richer and busier countries, more people have trouble sleeping and feel worried. Studies in the USA show that 40 million Americans often feel very tired. Some popular books in Britain even have main characters who cannot sleep, or the stories happen in sleep labs.

People are interested in sleep itself: how it works, why it is important, and why some people can't sleep well. But the main worry is clear. One expert says, ""People need more sleep. When they are busy, they sleep less. They wake up very early to miss the busy traffic.""

A sleep scientist recently did a test. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours every night for a month. After three weeks, they only needed about eight hours of sleep each night. This shows they were catching up on sleep they had missed before.

In Europe, one university in England has a small building where they study sleep. The university's sleep lab has looked at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise affects sleep, and the risks of driving on the motorway when you are tired.

They find people for their studies by advertising in student newspapers. They pick people up by taxi, pay them £5 an hour, and ask them to change their sleep times. Dr. Louise Reyner says, ""Some people are nervous because we put sensors on their heads. They think we can see their dreams or thoughts.""

But the lab is more interested in the body. In a dark room, there is a machine that looks like a car, facing a big screen. People are asked to come at 2pm, when they are naturally sleepy, especially if they didn't sleep much the night before. They have to drive in the simulator and answer questions. The screen shows a road, the sun is bright, and the room is warm.

The young men always say they won't fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one man trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight and looks at the road. Then he starts to blink a lot, and his head drops a little. Each time his head drops, it gets worse. Soon, he closes his eyes for ten seconds. Each time, he wakes up suddenly, but by then, the car has already left the road.

Coffee could help. Dr. Reyner says two cups of coffee, even with no sleep, can make you drive safely for about half an hour. She suggests other things to help you stay awake, like pills, energy drinks, or gum with caffeine. She thinks people who work at night could use these.

But what else do we know for sure about sleep? We know that people, like other animals, sleep as part of a daily cycle. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to very deep sleep. We usually dream during light sleep. When we dream, the brain stops the body from moving (except for the eyes and hands) so we don't get hurt.

Other ideas about sleep are less certain. Some people think sleep helps fix the body, build muscles, or rest the part of the brain used for talking and ideas. But these things might also happen when we are resting while awake, so no one is sure.

Scientists are quite sure that women sleep about 30 minutes longer than men, and older people need less sleep, though they don't know why. When asked why we sleep, some experts say, ""Sleep is a way to pass through time safely.""

In the past, people may have slept differently. A history professor studied life at night in Britain from 1500 to 1850. He found that people went to bed at 9 or 10pm, woke up after midnight (after their ""first sleep""), stayed awake for about an hour, and then went back to sleep for their ""morning sleep.""

This time awake was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or sometimes for stealing. Poor people benefited most from this quiet time, free for a short while from their hard daily lives.

By the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, rich people started sleeping all through the night, which was better for work. Two hundred years later, the Industrial Revolution made most people work longer hours in lit buildings, so everyone except some people in the countryside started sleeping through the night.

Outside Europe and America, the old sleep pattern was common until not long ago. An expert says that in some non-Western places, people still don't have fixed bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, get up, and then sleep again. The idea of sleeping all night doesn't exist there. In some tribes, noises from people and animals, and the need to watch the fire and look out for danger, make it impossible to sleep without waking up. It seems that people everywhere really need more sleep.","Are We Getting Enough Sleep?

Many people claim that tiredness has become a common condition in modern life. As wealthier and busier nations develop, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased in the general population. Research in the United States has found that 40 million Americans are chronically affected by sleep problems. In Britain, several recent best-selling novels have featured characters who suffer from insomnia or have been set in sleep research laboratories.

There is growing interest in sleep itself—its patterns, functions, and common disorders. However, a central concern remains. According to one leading sleep researcher, ""People need more sleep. When they are busy, they reduce their sleep time. They wake up too early to avoid rush hour traffic.""

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He allowed participants to sleep up to 14 hours per night for an entire month. It took three weeks for them to stabilize at around eight hours of sleep per night. This suggests they had been experiencing significant sleep deprivation.

In Europe, such theories are tested extensively in a modest building at a university in central England. The university's sleep laboratory has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, how airport noise disturbs sleep, and the dangers of motorway driving when tired.

The laboratory recruits volunteers through student newspaper advertisements. Participants are collected by taxi, paid £5 per hour, and instructed to adjust their sleep schedules according to the study requirements. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures them: ""Some people feel anxious because we attach electrodes to their heads. They worry we can see their dreams or thoughts, but we cannot.""

The laboratory's focus is primarily physical rather than mental. In a darkened room, there is a motorway simulator consisting of a car's front section facing a large projection screen. Participants are always scheduled to arrive at 2 p.m., during the body's natural afternoon energy dip, particularly after limited or no sleep. They are asked to drive in the simulator while answering questions. An endless road appears ahead, with bright sunlight and warm air in the room.

The young male participants always insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video recording of one man struggling to stay awake. Initially, he sits upright with his eyes fixed on the windshield. Then he begins blinking briefly and occasionally, followed by longer and more frequent blinks as his head gradually drops. Each time his head falls, it becomes harder to lift. Eventually, his eyes remain closed for up to ten seconds. Although he jerks awake each time, by the second or third occurrence, the car has already left the road.

Coffee might have prevented this. Dr. Reyner states that two cups of coffee, even after no sleep, can maintain safe driving for half an hour or longer. She recommends various alertness products including tablets, energy drinks, and caffeinated chewing gum. She believes shift workers could benefit from using these products.

But what else do we truly understand about human sleep? We know that humans, like other mammals, follow a daily sleep cycle. During sleep, people move through four different stages of unconsciousness, from the lightest (stage one) to the deepest (stage four). Dreams typically occur during the lightest sleep phase, when the brain paralyzes the body except for the hands and eyelids to prevent injury.

Beyond these facts, certainties become theories. Some researchers suggest that sleep repairs body tissues, restores muscles, or allows the brain's frontal region—responsible for speech and creativity—to rest. However, these processes might occur equally effectively during relaxed wakefulness, leaving scientists uncertain.

Nevertheless, scientists generally agree that women sleep about thirty minutes longer than men, and that older people require less sleep, though the reasons remain unclear. When asked about sleep's purpose, some researchers offer philosophical answers: ""Sleep is a strategy to move through time without harm.""

Historical evidence suggests people may have had different sleep patterns in the past. A history professor investigating British nighttime life between 1500 and 1850 discovered that sleep routines differed significantly. People would go to bed around nine or ten o'clock, wake after midnight following their ""first sleep,"" remain awake for about an hour, and then return to sleep for their ""morning sleep.""

This nighttime interval provided opportunity for reflection, dream recollection, or even theft. The poorest members of society benefited most from this quiet period, briefly escaping the demands and labor that dominated their daytime lives.

By the seventeenth century, as artificial lighting became more widespread, wealthy people began adopting the continuous sleep pattern common today, which proved more economically efficient. Two centuries later, the Industrial Revolution extended working hours in illuminated buildings for most people, further establishing this sleep pattern.

Outside Europe and America, the historical sleep pattern remained common until recently. According to a prominent anthropologist, some non-Western communities still maintain flexible bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The concept of uninterrupted nighttime sleep doesn't apply. In certain tribal societies, human and animal noises, combined with the need to tend fires and watch for predators, make continuous sleep impossible. It appears that people worldwide are significantly lacking in sleep.",,
278,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly, by hand. It is, in other words, not only an agricultural metaphor, it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production, if the conditions are right, of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction. The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate.
Since television as a technology is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments. Two little-known, distinct alternatives deserve mentioning since they highlight what television might have been - in a different social context.
Experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone were followed up, so to speak, by radio amateurs in Britain in the early 1930s. Various popular science journals, such as Radio News, had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers and, throughout the 1930s, experimenting amateurs were active in many parts of the country. But Big Business, represented by the British Radio Manufacturers Association, in 1938 agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out. And so there passed, at least in Britain, the historical 'moment' for a counter-cultural development of television as a widely diffused, grass-roots, egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting in some form was, however, tied not only to strong economic interests, but also to the deep structures of modern societies. In spite of the activities of TV amateurs, television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s, and as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry. In fact, television was throughout the 19030s predominantly watched in public settings also outside of the USA. For example, in Britain, public viewing of television was the way in which most early audiences actually experienced the medium and this was even more the case in Germany. While the vision of grass-roots or amateur, two-way television was quite obviously doomed to a very marginal position at the very best, television systems largely based on collective public reception were in fact operating in several countries in the 1930s and may, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen as having presented more of a threat to the domestication of the medium. But it was a threat that was not to materialise.
Manufacturers saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets as soon as the price could be reduced, and given the division and relation between the public and private domains fundamental to modernity, centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states. And all of this is now also happening on a global scale.
There is a clear relationship between the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernisation meant increasing centralisation and concentration of capital and political power, the break-up of traditional communities produced new ways of life. Mobility was both social and geographical, and both forms implied that individuals and households were, both literally and metaphorically, 'on the move' in ways that left them relatively isolated compared to people in much more stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting was both an answer to the need felt by central government to reach all citizens with important information efficiently, and a highly useful instrument in the production of the harmonising, stabilising 'imagined community' of the nation-state.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the World Wars, the interest in broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources necessary for conscious, informed and autonomous participation in political, social and cultural life played a very important role in many countries. Of course television is changing, and there is the risk that the very term broadcasting becomes outmoded or at least inadequate. In which case, this metaphor will be seen only as referring to a particular organisation of audio-visual technology during a certain centralised phase of social modernisation. ",C2,,,,"The word 'broadcasting' originally meant spreading seeds by hand over a wide area. This is not just a farming idea; it also represents a hopeful, modern view. It suggests planned growth over a large area and, if conditions are good, a successful result. This idea assumes there is a central source of seeds, meaning centralised resources that are meant to be spread widely and to reproduce.

It is interesting to ask why this new technology for sending words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this farming idea seem so suitable. Television technology is related to two-way communication like the telegraph and telephone. So it is surprising that from the beginning, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, sending signals to private homes from a central place fit well with the social and economic systems and the main lifestyles of modern societies. Experiments with other ways of organising television remained just experiments.

Two less-known alternatives show what television could have been in a different society. In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television that could replace the telephone. Popular science magazines had instructions for building television equipment, and amateurs were active across the country. However, big business, through the British Radio Manufacturers Association, decided on official standards for television in 1938. This pushed the amateur activists out of the market. So, in Britain, the chance for a more community-based, equal form of television communication was lost.

Broadcasting was connected not only to strong business interests but also to the basic structure of modern societies. Even with amateur activity, television in the early 1930s in the USA was mainly a medium for public shows, and it was seen as a possible competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places in many countries, including Britain and Germany. The idea of a community-based, two-way television was clearly going to be very limited. Television systems based on public viewing did exist in several countries and could have been a challenge to television becoming a home-based medium, but this challenge did not succeed.

Manufacturers saw the possibility of selling large numbers of televisions for the home as soon as prices became lower. Considering the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralised broadcasting to homes was clearly the most suitable way to organise the medium. As working-class people's living standards improved and they joined the consumer society from the 1920s, the dream of a home filled with entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for most people in Western countries. This is now happening all over the world.

There is a clear link between the main processes of social modernisation and the main structures of broadcasting. Social and economic modernisation meant that capital and political power became more centralised. At the same time, traditional communities broke down, creating new lifestyles. People experienced social and geographical mobility. This meant that individuals and families were 'on the move' and felt more isolated compared to people in more stable, older communities. Centralised broadcasting was an answer to the government's need to reach all citizens with information efficiently. It was also a very useful tool for creating a sense of a united national community.

The strength of these social processes and interests made broadcasting the 'natural' winning way to organise radio and television. What is not discussed here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a form that can also support democracy. When broadcast policies were created between the World Wars, the goal of using it to give everyone equal access to information for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life was very important in many countries.

Of course, television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' might become old-fashioned or no longer suitable. If that happens, this farming metaphor will be seen as only describing a specific way of organising television and radio during a centralised period of social modernisation.","Broadcasting: The Social Development of a Technology

The word 'broadcasting' originally described the action of scattering seeds by hand across a field. This agricultural image not only suggests planned, widespread growth but also reflects the hopeful outlook of modernism. It implies that, with the right conditions, a successful outcome can be achieved. The metaphor assumes a central supply of seeds, representing concentrated resources meant for wide distribution. This leads to the question of why a new electronic technology for sending words and pictures was organised in a way that made this farming comparison seem so appropriate.

Although television technology is connected to interactive communication systems like the telegraph and telephone, it was imagined from the beginning as a centralised mass medium. This model, sending signals from one central point to private homes, matched the existing social and economic systems and ways of living in modern societies. Other ways of organising television were tried, but they remained only experiments. Two less familiar alternatives are worth mentioning because they show how television could have been different in another social situation.

In the early 1930s, British radio amateurs experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Magazines like Radio News published detailed guides for building television equipment, and amateur activity was common throughout the decade. However, in 1938, commercial groups such as the British Radio Manufacturers Association agreed on technical standards and channel rules that pushed these amateur efforts aside. As a result, the chance for a more open and equal form of television was lost, at least in Britain.

Broadcasting was influenced not just by business interests but also by the basic structures of modern societies. Despite amateur experiments, television in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public shows, especially in the United States, where it was seen as possible competition for the film industry. Public television viewing was also common in countries like Britain and Germany. While amateur two-way television remained very limited, systems based on group viewing in public places existed in several nations and might have offered an alternative to home-based television, though this never fully happened.

Manufacturers saw the opportunity for large-scale sales of home television sets once prices became lower. Considering the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralised broadcasting to individual homes became the most suitable model. As working-class people gained better living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the idea of the home as a centre for entertainment became possible for most people in Western countries—a trend that has since spread worldwide.

There is a clear link between social modernisation and the main structures of broadcasting. Social and economic modernisation meant greater centralisation of money and political power, while the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People's increased mobility, both socially and geographically, meant individuals and families became more isolated compared to earlier, more stable communities. Centralised broadcasting served both the government's need to reach all citizens with information and helped create a shared sense of national identity.

The combination of these social processes and interests made broadcasting the normal model for both radio and television. It is also important to note broadcasting's potential as a form suitable for democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information, which would allow people to participate knowledgeably in political, social and cultural life. While television continues to change, and the term 'broadcasting' may eventually seem old-fashioned, it will probably be viewed as describing a particular centralised period in the development of audiovisual technology during social modernisation.",
279,"Metals

It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river, waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw, or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It did not have the feel of stone, but it was attractive. In such a way, one could conjecture that gold entered the lives of primitive people.
Given the malleability of the metal, it very soon became a much sought-after material. Copper may also have been discovered by accident, and once the value of copper tools was realised, the search for its ores and for ways of getting the copper out of them was pursued with vigour. Thus, metalworking was added to our ancestors' battery of life-enhancing accomplishments.

St Ives

There was silence as we lugged our bags down the winding, cobbled lane that led to the heart of town, bent double against the force eight gale and trying in vain to avoid the icy waves that smashed over the promenade. There was no one on the streets and the shutters in every cottage on the waterfront were bolted tight against the battering. We had watched the weather worsen as we chugged into St Ives on the tiny single-track railway. As the ominous grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season - without a car - no longer seemed such a good idea. I had lured my friend into joining me with the promise of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast, and snug evenings, toasting ourselves before open fires.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again, perhaps we can.
Computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric landscapes and environments and populate them with virtual communities - digital creations with some of the needs, independence and capabilities of real-world humans. We can establish rules of conduct and replicate social units. Then we can turn down the rainfall - or turn up the population - and watch how this cyber-culture and its artificial people react.",C2,,"**Metals**

Long ago, people in the Stone Age might have liked metals because they wanted to look nice. One day, a person sat by a river. They saw a small, shiny, yellow stone in the water and picked it up. It felt different from other stones. It was pretty. This is probably how people first found gold.

Gold is soft and easy to shape. So, people wanted it very much. People also found copper by chance. They saw that copper tools were good. Then, they looked for more copper. They learned how to get the copper from rocks. This is how our ancestors started to work with metal. It helped them a lot.

**St Ives**

It was quiet as we walked with our bags into the town. The street was narrow and made of stone. The wind was very strong. We had to bend over. Cold water from the sea hit the path. We tried to stay dry, but it was hard. The streets were empty. All the houses by the sea were closed because of the bad weather.

We saw the weather get worse from the train. The sky turned dark grey. Our trip to Cornwall at a quiet time of year now seemed like a bad idea. I told my friend we would have nice walks by the sea and warm nights by the fire. That is why he came with me.

**Computer Modelling**

It is hard to study the past because it is over. The people from long ago are dead. We do not know why they lived in some places or moved to others. We do not know why they made families and towns. Archaeology helps us guess, but we cannot test our ideas on real people from the past. We cannot go back in time. But maybe we can use a computer.

With a computer, we can make a picture of the old world. We can put computer people in it. These computer people need some things that real people need. We can make rules for how they live. Then we can change things. We can make less rain or add more people. We can watch what happens to the computer people.","**Metals**

Long ago, Stone Age people might have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. Imagine one of our early ancestors sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish or just relaxing. They might have found a shiny yellow stone in the water and picked it up. It felt different from other stones and looked nice. This is probably how gold first came into the lives of early people.

Because gold is soft and easy to shape, it quickly became a very popular material. Copper was also probably found by chance. When people understood that copper tools were useful, they started looking hard for copper rocks and for ways to get the copper out of them. So, working with metal became another important skill for our ancestors.

It was very quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, stone street into the town centre. We were bent over because the wind was so strong, and we tried to stay away from the cold waves hitting the path.

I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and warm evenings by the fire.

The difficulty with studying history is that it has already happened. The people who lived in good times and bad times are no longer alive. The reasons why they lived in one place or moved to another, or why they formed families and towns, are mostly forgotten. Archaeology gives us some ideas, but we can't test these ideas with real experiments on people from the past. We can't go back in time to see what really happened. But maybe there is another way.

Computer modelling lets us build old landscapes and environments on a computer. We can fill them with virtual communities—these are digital people who have some of the same needs and abilities as real humans. We can create rules for how they behave and make groups like families. Then we can change things, like making less rain or adding more people, and see how this computer society and its artificial people respond.","Metals

280,"How to Write Poetry

Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day, but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. Setting oneself up as a know-all is dangerous, so I have decided to side-step the whole issue by saying that, for someone just beginning to write, no advice can be a substitute for abundant reading, extensive writing, and the freeing of the imagination and spirit in whatever way seems fruitful, barring total anarchy. Some people need their life to be reasonably secure before a poem will come; others can write their way out of misery. Some write to a timetable: others wait for some moment of crystallisation, a brainwave or slow dawning. All are right, providing they are not echoing some prescriptive score. And it's this finding of a tune which is important, hearing the still small voice inside yourself and feeding it, and watering it, and letting it out for air from time to time; one day it'll be old enough to take care of itself.

The Short Story

In the short story there is no room for overcrowding with too many characters, slabs of lengthy narrative, prolonged reminiscence or retrospection. Flashbacks must be fleeting, and only used if there is no other way to throw light on an issue. One effective way to do this is through a flash of memory in the leading character's mind; the recollection or reminder of an incident or scene, which stirred the current conflict. Such a recollection can get the story on its way or take it a big step forward at a crucial moment, but never at any time must it be allowed to put a brake on the action. In this respect, dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. Two voices in discussion can reveal two sides of a question in far less time than it takes to explain it from only one person's viewpoint. It also avoids unnecessary wordage and holds or increases a reader's interest. Overwriting can kill a short story from the start, but this doesn't mean that brevity must reduce it to the level of a synopsis. Conflict and action must be as well sustained in a short story as in a novel, but in the short story the art lies in making every word count in a compact space.

Screenplays

Anyone who knows how to play chess will understand how to write a screenplay for a film. Most chess players stumble from beginning to end. We don't know much, but we know enough to play. We move without really knowing what's going to happen further on in the game. Maybe we can see one or two moves ahead, and, if we can, were pleased by our uncanny ability to see even that far ahead. Better than the days when we couldst see ahead at all - when we were playing blindly.
Over time, as we learned more about playing chess, we made a startling revelation: chess depends more upon long-term strategy than upon short-term tactics. Up till then, we'd been happy with a rather short-sighted approach. Suddenly, we became aware of 'the big picture'. We began to see the game as a whole, not just a series of individual moves. And once we saw the game as a whole, we began to see patterns emerge in the play. Gambits, they call them. And the patterns have names, such as openings, middle games and end games. In chess, as in screenplay writing, the more often you play, the more aware you become of its complexities.

Looking at Writing

'Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew, or write'. More than a century ago, Charles Darwin got it right: language is a human instinct, but written language is not. Language is found in all societies, present and past. Although languages change, they do not improve: English is no more complex than the languages of Stone Age tribes; modern English is not an advance of Old English. All healthy children master their language without lessons or corrections. When children are thrown together without a usable language, they invent one of their own. Compare all this with writing.
Writing systems have been invented only infrequently in history. They originated only in a few complex civilisations and they started off code and slowly improved over the millennia. Until recently, most children never learned to read or write; even with today's universal education, many children struggle and fail. A group of children is no more likely to invent an alphabet than it is to invent the internal combustion engine. Children are wired for sound, but print is an optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on. We need to understand how the contraption called writing works, how the minds of the children work, how to get the two to mesh.",C2,"**How to Write Poems**

Writing poems is like playing. You must be free. Do not try to know everything. For a new writer, do this: read a lot, write a lot, and let your mind be free. Some people write when they are happy. Other people write when they are sad. Some people write every day. Other people write when they have a new idea. All ways are good. The important thing is to find your own way. Listen to the small voice inside you. Help it grow. One day, it will be strong.

**The Short Story**

A short story is small. Do not use too many people. Do not write long parts. You can use a short memory. People talking is good. It is fast and fun. Do not use too many words. But the story must be good. Every word must help the story.

**Movie Scripts**

Writing a movie script is like playing a game. At first, you do not know much. You do one thing, then another. You do not know the end. You are happy to see one step ahead. Later, you learn. You see the whole game. You see the start, the middle, and the end. It is the same with a movie script. Write more to learn more.

**Learning to Write**

A smart man, Charles Darwin, said all people like to talk. Babies make sounds. But no baby knows how to write. All people in the world talk. Languages are different, but all are good. Children learn to talk easily. They do not need school. If children have no words, they make new words. Writing is not like talking. Writing is new. Only a few people made writing. Long ago, most people did not read or write. Today, many children find it hard. Children do not make writing on their own. They are ready to talk, but they must learn to read and write. We must know how writing works and how to teach children.","**How to Write Poetry**

It is hard to tell someone how to write a poem. It is best to be free and natural. Do not say you know everything. For a person who is just starting, the best thing to do is to read a lot, write a lot, and let your mind be free.

Some people need a safe life to write a poem. Other people write to feel better when they are sad. Some people write at the same time every day. Others wait for a good idea to come. All of these ways are good if the writer is not just copying someone else.

The most important thing is to find your own way. Listen to the small voice inside you. Help it to grow. One day, it will be strong.

**The Short Story**

A short story is short. So, you cannot have too many people in it. You also cannot have very long stories about the past. If you use a memory, it must be short. It must help the story move. It must not stop the story.

Talking between people in the story is very useful. Two people talking can show two sides of a problem. This is fast and uses fewer words. It keeps the reader interested.

Do not use too many words. But the story must not be too simple. A short story needs action and problems, just like a long book. The skill is to make every word important.

**Screenplays**

Writing a film script is like playing chess. Most chess players do not know everything. They just start to play. They make a move without knowing what will happen next. Sometimes they can see one or two moves ahead. This makes them happy.

Later, they learn something new. Chess is about a plan for the whole game, not just the next move. Then they see the whole game. They see patterns in the game. These patterns have names, like the start, the middle, and the end.

It is the same with writing a film script. The more you write, the more you learn.

**Looking at Writing**

A man named Charles Darwin said this a long time ago: people naturally want to speak. You can hear this in the sounds of young children. But no child naturally wants to write.

He was right. Language is natural for people, but writing is not. All groups of people have a language. Languages change, but they do not get better. Modern English is not better than Old English. Children learn to speak easily, without lessons. If children are together with no language, they will make one.

Now, think about writing. Writing was not invented many times in history. It started in only a few places. It began as a code and got better over a very long time.

Until recently, most children did not learn to read or write. Even today, many children find it very hard. A group of children will not make up an alphabet, just like they will not make a car engine.

Children's minds are ready for sound and speech. But reading and writing is an extra skill. We must learn it with hard work. We need to know how writing works and how children think so we can teach them well.","How to Write Poetry

Telling someone how to write a poem is difficult. It is better to be natural, but if you give too many rules, it can cause problems. I don't want to act like I know everything. So, for a beginner, the best advice is to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination be free. Some people need a calm life to write a poem. Others write to feel better from a sad time. Some people write at the same time every day. Others wait for a good idea to come to them. All these ways are fine, as long as the writer is not just copying someone else. The important thing is to find your own way. Listen to the small voice inside you, help it grow, and let it out sometimes. One day, it will be strong enough to look after itself.

The Short Story

A short story is short, so you cannot have too many people in it. You should not have long descriptions or spend too much time talking about the past. If you use a flashback, it should be very short and only used if it helps explain the story. A good way is to have the main character remember something important. This memory can help start the story or move it forward at an important time. But it must not stop the story from moving. Dialogue is very useful for this. When two people talk, they can show two different sides of a problem much faster than one person explaining it. It also uses fewer words and keeps the reader interested. Using too many words can ruin a short story from the beginning. But a short story should not be as short as a summary. A short story, like a novel, needs to have action and problems, but you must make every word important in a small space.

Screenplays

If you know how to play chess, you can understand how to write a film script. Most people who play chess do not know everything about the game. They know just enough to play. They make a move without knowing what will happen later. Sometimes they can see one or two moves ahead, and they feel happy about that. This is better than when they first started and could not see anything ahead. They were playing without a plan.
After playing for a while, they learn something important. Chess is more about a plan for the whole game than just the next move. Before, they only thought about the next move. Then, they start to see the whole game. They see it as one thing, not just many separate moves. When they see the whole game, they start to see patterns. These patterns have names, like the start of the game, the middle, and the end. In chess, and in writing a film script, the more you do it, the more you understand how complicated it is.

Looking at Writing

Charles Darwin said something right a long time ago. He said that people naturally want to speak, like babies who make sounds. But no child naturally knows how to bake, make beer, or write. Language is a natural skill for humans, but writing is not. All groups of people, now and in the past, have language. Languages change, but they do not get better. The English we speak today is not better than the language of very old tribes. Children learn to speak easily without being taught. If children are together with no language, they will make their own. Now, think about writing.
Writing was not invented many times in history. It started only in a few advanced societies. It began as a simple code and got better over thousands of years. Until recently, most children did not learn to read or write. Even now, with school for everyone, many children find it hard and do not succeed. A group of children will not invent writing, just like they will not invent a car engine. Children's brains are ready for spoken language, but reading and writing is an extra skill that is difficult to learn. We need to understand how writing works, how children think, and how to help them learn it.","How to Write Poetry

Explaining how to write poetry is like walking through a dangerous field: you need to be natural, but one wrong step and many ideas can fail. Acting like you know everything is risky, so I will avoid this by saying that for beginners, no advice is better than reading a lot, writing often, and freeing your imagination in any useful way, as long as it's not completely chaotic. Some people need a stable life to write a poem; others write to escape their problems. Some follow a strict schedule; others wait for a moment of inspiration. All these methods are correct, as long as they are not just copying fixed rules. What matters is finding your own style, listening to your inner voice, helping it grow, and giving it space. One day, it will be strong enough to look after itself.

The Short Story

A short story should not have too many characters, long descriptions, or extended memories. Quick flashbacks should only be used when necessary, for example, to explain the main character's current problem through a sudden memory. This memory can help move the story forward at an important moment, but it should never slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful here. A conversation between two people can show different sides of a problem much faster than one person's explanation. It also uses fewer words and keeps the reader interested. Using too many words can ruin a short story from the start, but being brief should not make it just a summary. Conflict and action must be as strong in a short story as in a novel, but in a short story, every word must be important in a limited space.

Screenplays

If you know how to play chess, you can understand how to write a film script. Most chess players move from start to finish without a clear plan. We know just enough to play. We make moves without knowing what will happen later. Sometimes we can plan one or two moves ahead, and we feel pleased with ourselves for thinking that far. This is better than when we started and couldn't plan at all—when we played without thinking.
As we learn more about chess, we discover something important: chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. Before, we were happy with a limited view. Then, we started to see the whole game, not just separate moves. Once we saw the whole game, we noticed patterns in how to play. These patterns have names, like openings, middle games, and end games. In chess, as in writing screenplays, the more you practice, the more you understand its challenges.

Looking at Writing

""People naturally want to speak, as we hear in the sounds of young children; but no child naturally wants to bake, make drinks, or write."" Over a hundred years ago, Charles Darwin was correct: language is a natural human ability, but writing is not. All societies have language, past and present. Languages change, but they don't get better: English is not more advanced than the languages of ancient tribes; modern English is not an improvement on Old English. Healthy children learn to speak without lessons or corrections. If children are together without a common language, they create one. Now compare this with writing.
Writing systems were rarely created in history. They started in only a few advanced societies and began as simple codes, slowly getting better over thousands of years. Until recently, most children didn't learn to read or write; even with schools everywhere today, many children find it difficult and don't succeed. A group of children won't invent an alphabet any more than they would invent a car engine. Children are born ready for speech, but writing is an extra skill that must be carefully taught. We need to understand how writing works, how children's minds work, and how to connect the two.","Offering guidance on writing poetry is like walking through a minefield: spontaneity is essential, but a single wrong move can make many certainties explode. Presenting yourself as an expert is risky, so I have decided to avoid the issue by stating that, for those starting to write, no advice can replace wide reading, frequent writing, and freeing the imagination in any productive way, as long as it doesn’t lead to complete disorder. Some people need their lives to be fairly secure before a poem appears; others write to escape unhappiness. Some write according to a schedule; others wait for a moment of clarity, a sudden idea or gradual understanding. All these methods are valid, as long as they are not just copying a fixed formula. What matters is finding your own voice—listening to that quiet inner sound, feeding it, and letting it out occasionally until it is mature enough to look after itself.

The Short Story

In a short story, there is no space for too many characters, long descriptive passages, or extended memories. Flashbacks should be brief and used only when there is no other way to explain something important. One effective method is to show a sudden memory in the main character’s mind—a recollection of an event or scene that caused the current conflict. Such a memory can start the story or move it forward at a key moment, but it must never slow down the action. In this sense, dialogue is more useful than many new writers think. A conversation between two people can show different sides of an issue much faster than explaining it from one person’s view. It also avoids unnecessary words and keeps or increases the reader’s interest. Using too many words can ruin a short story from the beginning, but this does not mean that being brief should turn it into a simple summary. Conflict and action must be as well maintained as in a novel, but in a short story, the skill is in making every word matter in a limited space.

Screenplays

Anyone who knows how to play chess will understand the basics of writing a film screenplay. Most chess players move uncertainly from start to finish. We don’t know everything, but we know enough to play. We make moves without really knowing what will happen later in the game. Sometimes we can see one or two moves ahead, and if we can, we feel pleased with our ability to see that far. This is better than when we started and could not see ahead at all—when we were playing without any plan. Over time, as we learn more about chess, we make an important discovery: chess depends more on long-term strategy than on short-term moves. Before that, we were satisfied with a limited view. Suddenly, we become aware of the overall situation. We start to see the game as a whole, not just separate moves. And once we see the game as a whole, we notice patterns in the play. These are called gambits. The patterns have names, like openings, middle games, and end games. In chess, as in writing screenplays, the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

Perspectives on Writing

“Humans have a natural tendency to speak, as we see in the chatter of young children; but no child has a natural tendency to bake, brew, or write.” More than a hundred years ago, Charles Darwin was correct: language is a human instinct, but writing is not. Language exists in all societies, past and present. Although languages change, they do not get better: English is not more complex than the languages of Stone Age tribes; modern English is not an improvement on Old English. All normal children learn their language without formal lessons or correction. When children are brought together without a shared language, they create one themselves. Now compare this with writing.

Writing systems have been invented only a few times in history. They began in a small number of advanced societies and started as basic codes, slowly improving over thousands of years. Until recently, most children never learned to read or write; even with today’s widespread education, many children find it difficult and do not succeed. A group of children is no more likely to create an alphabet than to invent a car engine. Children are naturally prepared for sound, but writing is an added skill that must be carefully taught. We need to understand how writing works, how children’s minds work, and how to connect the two.",

We've all heard of global warming, but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives?

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about, but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. And since the atmosphere is intimately linked every aspect of the planet on which we live, any changes to climate will have significant knock-on effects for plants and animals, as well as water and soils.
We humans have learned to use such natural resources to our advantage, enabling us to produce food, build great cities and support six billion members of the human race. Any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously. The problem we have is knowing just how the world will change, and what is causing these changes.
There is no doubt, for example, that over the last 100 years or so, human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases -- which are closely related to global temperature. It seems likely that these increased concentrations, which are set to continue building up in the near future, are already affecting global climate, but our poor knowledge and understanding of the global heat balance make the current and future situations uncertain. What we do know is that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have fluctuated in close harmony with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years.
This would indicate that the two are almost certainly related. Evidence gleaned from a range of sources suggests that our planet has warmed at the surface by about 6C over the past century. Most scientists think that this trend is unlikely to be natural in origin and is, in part, a result of human pollution of the atmosphere.
A lot of research has gone into predicting the conditions that will result from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs known as general circulation models, or GCMs. They run on powerful computers, use fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to analyse the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation and other climatic factors to predict climatic condition for the past, present or future.
Unfortunately, they are simplifications of the real would and have numerous deficiencies. Their results are only approximate and they are also slow to run and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system, although we do realise its complexity.
Despite these research difficulties, most people agree on perhaps the most important aspect of climatic change from the viewpoint of contemporary human societies: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. In this case, the approximate predictions produced by GCMs are being used to gain some insight into the nature and conditions of the world that we will inhabit over the next few generations.
Currently, they suggest that the average annual global surface temperature will increase by between 1C and 3.5C by the year 2100; that the average sea level around the world will rise by 15-95 cm; and that changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, to become more frequent in some places.
These forecasts should leave us in little doubt about the potential impact of climatic change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate have the potential to affect the geographical locations of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands, the mix of species they contain and their ability to provide the various benefits on which societies depend for their continued existence. Thus, the whole range of resources on which we rely is sensitive to changes in climate. This includes food production, water resources and human settlements. The effects, some of which are potentially irreversible, are likely to be unfavourable in many areas.
But this would not be true for all. In fact, some climate change impacts will probably be beneficial. Scientists in some countries have already identified useful environmental trends that are closely linked to the warming that has occurred to date. In Australia, for example, research has shown that the average yield of wheat has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, and climate trends have played a significant part in this greater food production.
The most important climatic factor observed in this case was the rise, in recent decades, of the minimum temperature. Among other things, the warmer temperatures have meant fewer frosts, and this has caused less damage to harvests. 
However, many of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. Relatively small changes in climate can influence the availability of water, either due to long-term dying of the climate or by increasing the frequency of droughts. Associated problems are likely to arise first in arid and semi-arid regions and more humid areas where demand or pollution have already created shortages.
The Mediterranean Basin is one example of this and in recent decades decreasing trends in precipitation totals have already been identified in western-central parts of the basin as well as marked changes in seasonality. A clear tendency for rainfall to be concentrated into a shorter period of the year has been noted in the Alentejo region of southern Portugal, with the proportion of annual rainfall falling in autumn and winter, increasing at the expense of spring totals.
A further undesirable effect is likely to be changes to glacial processes. This will impact on glacier ice, ground ice and sea ice, which in turn will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats and human structures and facilities. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that the Arctic's ice cover will melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.
But probably the most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the twenty-first or 'greenhouse' century will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean -- warmer water occupies a greater volume than cold water -- and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe.
Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results, with London, New York and Tokyo being just a few of the candidates for significant disruption. Huge numbers of people stand to lose their homes and livelihoods and this could produce many millions of environmental refugees.
Arguably the most severe consequences would be experienced by several small, low-lying island states, since entire countries could cease to exist if worst-case scenarios are realised. The consequences would be devastating, not only for the people and culture of these islands, but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those who had been displaced.",C2,,"The Heat is On

We all know the world is getting warmer. But how much warmer will it get? How will it change our lives?

Most people know a little about global warming. But no one knows exactly what will happen. A warmer world will mean different weather in all places. Because the air is connected to everything on Earth, changes to the weather will also change plants, animals, water, and land.

We use these natural things to live. We grow food, build cities, and have homes. If these things change, it is a big problem. The problem is we do not know how the world will change or why.

For about 100 years, people have put more gases into the air. These gases make the world hotter. The gases are still increasing. They are probably changing the world's weather now. But we do not understand everything about the world's heat. We know that when these gases are in the air, the world gets warmer.

Scientists think the world's surface is about half a degree hotter now than 100 years ago. Most scientists think this is not natural. They think it is because people make the air dirty.

Scientists use computers to guess what will happen with a hotter world. The computers use science rules to understand the weather.

But the computer guesses are not perfect. They are simple. Their answers are not exact. The weather is very difficult to understand.

Most people agree on one thing: the weather is changing very fast. We use the computer guesses to understand the world our children will live in.

The computers say that by the year 2100, the world will be 1 to 3.5 degrees hotter. The sea level will go up by 15 to 95 centimeters. Rain and snow will fall in different places and at different times. Some places will have more very hot days, floods, and dry times.

These changes will affect nature and people. Weather changes can move forests and grasslands. The plants and animals there can change. This can hurt the things people need, like food and water. Our farms, our water, and our towns can all be hurt. Some changes may be forever.

But not all changes are bad. In some places, changes are good. In Australia, farmers grow more wheat now. This is partly because the weather is warmer. Warmer nights mean less frost, which is good for plants.

But many future changes will be bad. Small weather changes can mean less water. Some places may be dry for a long time or have no rain. This is a big problem in dry places and places with little clean water.

One example is the area near the Mediterranean Sea. Some parts already have less rain. In southern Portugal, most rain now falls only in autumn and winter. There is less rain in spring.

Another bad change is to ice. Ice on mountains and in the sea will melt. This will change where plants grow and where animals live. It can break roads and buildings. The ice in the Arctic may melt completely. This helps ships travel and look for oil, but it makes more icebergs.

The biggest change to see is the sea level rising. This happens because water gets bigger when it is warm, and ice from land melts into the sea. Almost half of all people live near the sea. So, if the sea rises, it is very dangerous.

The main problem is more floods. Big cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could have big problems. Many people could lose their homes and jobs. Millions of people might have to move to new places.

The worst problems are for people on small, flat islands. If the sea rises too much, their whole country could go under water. This is very bad for the people, their way of life, and for the countries that must help them find new homes.","The Heat is On

We all know about global warming, but how much hotter will the Earth get and how will it change our lives?

Most people understand what global warming is, but no one is sure what will happen because of it. A warmer world will probably mean different weather everywhere. Because the air is connected to everything on our planet, changes to the climate will also affect plants, animals, water, and soil.

We use these natural things to live. They help us grow food, build cities, and support all the people on Earth. So, any changes to them are important. The problem is we don't know exactly how the world will change or what is causing these changes.

For example, in the last 100 years, people have put more gases into the air. These gases are connected to the Earth's temperature. It is likely that these gases, which are still increasing, are already changing the world's climate. But we don't understand everything about how the Earth stays warm, so the future is not clear. We do know that the amount of these ""greenhouse gases"" and the Earth's temperature have changed together for thousands of years.

This shows they are probably connected. Information from different places tells us the Earth's surface has become about 0.6°C warmer in the last 100 years. Most scientists think this change is not natural and is partly because of pollution from people.

Scientists use computers to try to predict what will happen with higher temperatures. These computer programs use science rules to study how temperature, air pressure, sunlight, and other things work together. They try to guess the climate of the past, present, or future.

But these computer programs are simple versions of the real world and have problems. Their answers are not exact, and they are slow and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that the climate system is very complex, and we don't understand all of it.

Even with these problems, most people agree on one important thing: the climate is changing faster than ever before. So, we use the computer's guesses to try to understand the world our children and grandchildren will live in.

Right now, the computers suggest that by the year 2100:
*   The world's average temperature will be 1°C to 3.5°C hotter.
*   The sea level around the world will rise by 15 to 95 cm.
*   Rain and snow will fall in different places and at different times.
Scientists also think very hot weather, floods, and dry periods will happen more often in some areas.

These predictions show us that climate change can have a big effect on nature and people. Changes in climate can move forests and grasslands, change the plants and animals that live there, and affect the things that people need to live. Things like growing food, having enough water, and living in cities can all be hurt by climate change. The effects will be bad in many places, and some changes might be forever.

But it won't be bad for everyone. In fact, some effects of climate change could be good. For example, in Australia, farmers are growing more wheat per field since 1952. Warmer weather has helped because there are fewer frosts to damage the plants.

However, many of the predicted changes are not good. Small changes in climate can mean there is less water, either because the weather is drier for a long time or because droughts happen more often. This will be a big problem first in dry areas and in places where there is already not enough clean water.

One example is the area around the Mediterranean Sea. In recent years, some parts have had less rain, and the time of year when it rains has changed. In southern Portugal, for example, more rain now falls in autumn and winter, and less in the spring.

Another bad effect will be on ice. Ice on mountains, in the ground, and in the sea will melt. This will change where plants can grow, where animals can live, and it can damage buildings and roads. The ice in the Arctic might melt completely. This would make it easier for ships to travel and to look for oil and gas, but it would also create more dangerous icebergs.

But the biggest and easiest effect to see will be the rising sea level. This happens because water gets bigger when it is warm, and because ice melting from land flows into the sea. Almost half of all people in the world live near the coast, so rising seas are a very serious problem.

The most obvious results will be more flooding. Big cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could have big problems. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, creating millions of refugees.

The worst problems might be for some small island countries. If the sea rises too much, these whole countries could disappear under water. This would be terrible for the people and culture of the islands, and also for the countries that would have to help the people who lost their homes.","The Heat is On

We have all heard about global warming, but how much will the Earth's temperature actually rise, and how will it change our lives?

Most people understand the basic idea of global warming, but they are not sure what effects it will have. A warmer planet will probably bring changes to weather patterns everywhere. Because the atmosphere is connected to every part of our world, changes in the climate will also have important effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.

We humans depend on these natural resources to live. We use them to grow food, build cities, and support a population of billions. Any changes to these resources are a serious problem. The difficulty is knowing exactly how the world will change and what is causing these changes.

For example, it is certain that over the last 100 years, human activities have released more of certain gases into the air. These gases are linked to global temperature. It is likely that these increased gas levels, which are still rising, are already changing the world's climate. However, we do not fully understand the Earth's heat system, so the current and future situations are uncertain. What we do know is that the levels of these greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together for the past 40,000 years.

This strongly suggests that the two are connected. Evidence from different sources shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly caused by human pollution.

A lot of research has tried to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models, or GCMs. These programs run on powerful computers and use the laws of physics and chemistry to study how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other climate factors interact. They try to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future.

Unfortunately, these models are simplified versions of the real world and have many weaknesses. Their results are only estimates, and they are slow and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not completely understand all the processes in the climate system, although we know it is very complex.

Despite these problems, most experts agree on one very important point: the speed of climate change will be faster than anything we have seen before. Because of this, the estimates from GCMs are used to help us understand what the world might be like for future generations.

Currently, these models suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. They also predict that the average sea level will rise by 15 to 95 cm and that rainfall patterns will change. Scientists also expect extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to happen more often in some areas.

These predictions show that climate change could have a major impact on the natural environment and on people. Changes in climate could affect where forests and grasslands are located, which plants and animals live there, and their ability to provide resources that societies need to survive. This means that many things we depend on, like food production, water supplies, and where we live, are sensitive to changes in the climate. The effects, some of which may be permanent, will probably be negative in many parts of the world.

However, this is not true for all areas. In fact, some effects of climate change could be positive. Scientists in some countries have already noticed useful environmental changes linked to the warming that has happened so far. For example, in Australia, research shows that the average amount of wheat grown per hectare has increased by about 0.5 tonnes since 1952, and climate trends have played a big part in this increase.

In this case, one important climate factor was the rise in the lowest temperatures in recent decades. Among other things, warmer temperatures have meant fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops.

However, many of the predicted effects of future global warming are not good. Even small changes in climate can affect water supplies, either by making the climate drier in the long term or by causing more frequent droughts. These problems will probably appear first in dry and semi-dry regions, and also in wetter areas where water is already scarce because of high demand or pollution.

The Mediterranean region is one example. In recent decades, parts of the western and central Mediterranean have had less rain overall, and the seasons when rain falls have changed. For example, in southern Portugal's Alentejo region, more of the yearly rain now falls in autumn and winter, and less in the spring.

Another negative effect will probably be changes to ice and glaciers. This will affect glacier ice, ground ice, and sea ice, which will then affect plants, animal habitats, and human buildings and infrastructure. In fact, it is very possible that the Arctic's ice cover will melt completely. This would make shipping and oil and gas exploration easier, but it would also increase the danger from icebergs.

But the most dramatic and visible effect of global warming in the twenty-first century will likely be rising sea levels. This will happen because the ocean expands as it gets warmer—warm water takes up more space than cold water—and because of extra water from melting ice. Scientists estimate that about half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, so the results of rising sea levels could be very serious.

More flooding is the most obvious result. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face major problems. Huge numbers of people could lose their homes and jobs, creating millions of environmental refugees.

The most severe effects would probably be felt by several small, low-lying island nations. In the worst case, entire countries could disappear. The results would be devastating, not only for the people and culture of these islands, but also for the countries that would have to help those who lost their homes.",,
282,"Maps

The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth's surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. In early times distance wha often expressed in units of time, for example 'so many hours' march' or 'a day's journey by river', but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than they did about actual distance. The other element is direction, but for the ordinary traveller, whose main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', the accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Partly for this reason, written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Even today, certain types of maps, for example those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Similarly, conspicuous landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs, realistic or conventional, and varied in size to indicate their importance. Clearly the conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map, and also from place to place, so that in studying early maps the first essential is to understand the particular convention employed.
The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which these elements of distance and direction are determined and in the comprehensiveness of the map content. In this development, cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. For example, instead of determining direction by observing the position of a shadow at midday, or of a constellation in the night sky, or even of a steady wind, use was made of terrestrial magnetism through the magnetic compass, and instruments were evolved which enabled horizontal angles to be calculated with great accuracy. 
The application of astronomical concepts, and the extension of the knowledge of the world through 
exploration, encouraged attempts to map the known world. Then astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is flattened slightly at the poles, which introduced further refinements into the mapping of large areas. Meanwhile, the demands being made of the map maker were shifting significantly. The traveller or the merchant ceased to be the sole user of maps. The soldier, especially after the introduction of artillery, and the problems of range, field of fire, and dead ground which it raised, demanded an accurate representation of the surface features, in place of the earlier conventional or pictorial delineation, and a solution in any degree satisfactory was not reached until the contour was invented.
Then there was the archaeologist, the historian and, much later, the modern geographer, each with their own special requirements. In order to address these, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions', from geological strata and climatic regimes to land use. It is the present widespread recognition of the value of the map in the co-ordination and interpretation of phenomena in many sciences that has led to what may truly be called a modern renaissance o cartography.
It would be misleading of me to represent the stages summarily sketched above as being either continuous or consecutive. There have been periods of retrogression or stagnation, broken by others of rapid development, during which outmoded ideas have held their place beside the new. Again, cartographers have constantly realised the theoretical basis for progress, but have had to wait for technical improvement in their instruments before they could apply their new ideas. Since the easiest way to make a map is to copy an old one, and considerable capital has often been locked up in printing places or stock map publishers have often been resistant to new ideas. Consequently, maps must never be accepted uncritically as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique. 
Clearly, the maps, many thousands in number, which have come down to us today, are the results of much human work and thought. They constitute therefore an invaluable record for the students of man's past. It is above all this aspect that makes the study of historical cartography so fascinating and so instructive.",C2,,"A map shows where places are on Earth. It tells us how far away things are and which way to go. Long ago, people said how far something was by how long it took to walk there. This told them if the walk was easy or hard. Direction was important too, but people mostly asked, ""Which way do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" For a long time, written directions were as good as maps. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show the real direction. Important places on the way were shown with big or small pictures. How a map looked changed with what it was used for.

Over time, maps became better and more correct. Map makers got help from other kinds of science. For example, they started using a compass to find direction instead of the sun or stars. They also made tools to measure very well.

When people learned more about the world and space, they tried to make maps of all the known world. They learned that Earth is not a perfect ball. It is a little flat at the top and bottom. This helped make better maps of big places. Also, more people needed maps. Soldiers needed very exact maps to see the land clearly. They started using lines to show where land goes up and down.

Later, other people like scientists who study old things, history experts, and land experts needed special maps too. Today, map makers show many things on maps, like types of ground, weather, and how people use the land. Because maps are so helpful in science, making maps is popular again.

The story of map making did not always get better. Sometimes it stopped. Sometimes it went backwards. New ideas came, but old ideas stayed too. Map makers often had good ideas but needed better tools to make them. Also, because it is easy to copy an old map, some people did not want to change. So, we should not always think that an old map shows what people knew then.

The many old maps we have today are from a lot of work and thinking. They are a very important record of our past. This is why learning about old maps is so interesting and helpful.","Maps

A map shows how places and features on Earth connect to each other. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, like ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's travel by river."" But this told you more about how easy or hard the land was to cross than the real distance. Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Which way do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, showing direction perfectly wasn't always the most important thing. Because of this, written travel guides were as useful as maps for a long time. Even now, some maps, like train system maps, may not show true directions. Important landmarks along a route were shown with symbols, and their size showed how important they were. The symbols used depended on the map's purpose and where it was made. So, to understand old maps, you first need to understand the symbols they used.

The history of mapmaking is mostly about making maps more accurate and detailed. Mapmakers have used help from other sciences. For example, instead of finding direction by looking at a shadow at noon or at stars, they started using the magnetic compass. They also made tools to measure angles very accurately.

As people learned more about astronomy and explored the world, they tried to map all the known lands. Astronomers found that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but is a little flat at the top and bottom. This made mapping large areas more complex. At the same time, different people started needing maps. It wasn't just for travelers and traders anymore. Soldiers, especially after cannons were invented, needed very accurate maps of the land's shape, not just simple drawings. A good solution wasn't found until the contour line was created.

Later, archaeologists, historians, and geographers also needed special maps. To meet all these needs, today's mapmakers have learned to show many different things on maps, like types of rock, climate, and how land is used. Because maps are now so useful for understanding information in many sciences, we are seeing a new golden age of mapmaking.

It would be wrong to say that mapmaking improved smoothly and in order. There were times when it didn't improve or even went backwards, and other times when it developed very quickly. Old ideas sometimes stayed popular next to new ones. Also, mapmakers often had good new ideas but had to wait for better tools to make them work. Since copying an old map is the easiest way to make a new one, and because changing printing methods is expensive, map publishers were often slow to accept new ideas. Because of this, we should not always believe that an old map shows the best knowledge or techniques of its time.

The many thousands of maps we have from the past are the result of a lot of human work and thought. They are a very valuable record for people who study history. This is the main reason why studying old maps is so interesting and educational.","Maps

A map's purpose is to show the connections between different places and features on the Earth's surface. These connections are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in time, such as 'a few hours' walk' or 'a day's travel by river'. However, these measurements told people more about how easy or difficult the land was to cross than about the actual distance. Direction was the other important element, but for most travelers, the key questions were simply 'Which way do I go from here?' and 'How far is it?'. Because of this, accurate direction was not their main concern. For a long time, written travel guides were as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those of railway networks, do not always show true directions. Important landmarks along a route were shown with symbols, which could be realistic or simple drawings, and their size showed how significant they were. The symbols used depended on the map's purpose and the region it was from. Therefore, when studying old maps, the first step is to understand the specific symbols that were used.

The history of map-making is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and including more information. To do this, map-makers have used knowledge from other sciences. For example, instead of finding direction by looking at a shadow at noon or the stars at night, people started using the magnetic compass. New tools were also invented to measure angles very precisely.

Using ideas from astronomy and learning more about the world through exploration led to efforts to map the entire known world. Astronomers later discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flat at the poles, which made mapping large areas more complex. At the same time, the people who needed maps began to change. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users. Soldiers, especially after the invention of powerful cannons, needed maps that showed the shape of the land accurately, not just with simple pictures. A truly satisfactory method for this was not found until the contour line was invented.

Later, archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also needed maps, each for their own reasons. To meet all these needs, today's map-makers have developed ways to show many different types of information, from rock layers and climate to how land is used. The modern recognition of the map's value in connecting and explaining information for many sciences has led to a true rebirth of map-making.

It would be wrong to suggest that this development was always smooth and continuous. There have been times of little progress or even steps backward, mixed with periods of fast improvement, when old and new ideas existed together. Also, map-makers have often understood the theory for making better maps but had to wait for their tools to improve before they could put their new ideas into practice. Since copying an old map is the easiest way to make a new one, and because a lot of money is often invested in printed maps, publishers have sometimes been slow to accept new ideas. For this reason, we should never look at an old map and assume it perfectly represents the knowledge or technology of its time.

The thousands of maps that have survived until today are the result of a great deal of human effort and thought. They are an extremely valuable record for anyone studying the past. It is this quality, above all others, that makes the study of old maps so interesting and educational.",,
283,"Surviving in a Foreign Land

I have been welcomed warmly. It's a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very, very isolated place. At any one time, there are some forty odd souls - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers -- in a close-knit community where everyone mucks in. My school French is proving adequate - just -- to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast.
There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose terrified at the silence which fell when I spoke, anxious in a way I cannot remember since the first weeks of school. I still grin inanely, or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is nothing to do with loss of company or communication, it's because
I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Elliot

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other and he took no notice of me. He never forgot a face though, and when I ran across him here or there he shook hands with me cordially, but showed no desire to further our acquaintance; and if I saw him at the opera, say, he being with a person of high rank, he was inclined not to catch sight of me. But then I happened to make a somewhat startling success as a playwright, and presently I became aware that Elliot regarded me with a warmer feeling. One day, I received a note from him asking me to lunch and I conceived the notion that he was trying me out. But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.

Alfred Hitchcock

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message that stirred the audience, nor was it a great performance, he believed that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience.
Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable, he was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience. ",C2,,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

People were very friendly to me. The camp is a nice place with enough food and things. But it is very far from other places. There are about forty people here. They are scientists, students, and people who study the weather. Everyone works together. I learned French in school. It is enough for simple talking, but not for friendly talk with people. I do not understand the small meanings in their words. My book with phrases is not helpful at breakfast.

I do not have any real problems here. But at first, I did not feel sure of myself. I started to not like meal times. I waited because I did not know which table to sit at. I was scared when people were quiet after I spoke. I felt worried, like when I first started school. I still smile too much or feel scared when people talk to me. I think I sometimes feel sad because I have lost my confidence when I talk to people.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was a young writer. He did not notice me. But he never forgot a face. When I saw him in different places, he said hello in a friendly way. But he did not want to be my friend. For example, if I saw him at the opera with an important person, he did not look at me. Then I wrote a play that was very successful. After that, Elliot was much nicer to me. One day, he sent me a note. He asked me to come to lunch. I thought he wanted to see what kind of person I was. After that, I had many new friends because of my success. I started to see Elliot more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said something important. He said he did not care what his films were about. He did not care about the acting. He cared about the pictures and the sound. He cared about all the technical parts of making a film. Hitchcock believed that a message or great acting does not excite people. He thought people get excited by the film itself. It does not matter where they are from. So, if a film is made the right way, it will make people in Japan and people in India feel scared at the same time.

Hitchcock's thoughts about himself were always clear and made sense. He was a very smart man. He was very good at his job. He liked to hear people scream when they watched his films. He did not use difficult ideas. He did not try to explain his characters in a deep way. He only thought about film. He thought about how a film can make people feel something in a strong and exact way.","Living in a Foreign Country

I have been welcomed in a very friendly way. It is a social and well-supplied camp in a very far away place. There are about forty people here — scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite workers — and everyone helps each other. My basic French from school is enough to talk about simple things, but not to have relaxed conversations. I don't understand the small details, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast.

This is not a real problem for me, but at first I felt unsure of myself. I started to feel a little afraid of meal times. I would wait, not sure which table to sit at. I was worried about the silence when I spoke, and felt nervous in a way I haven'tt felt since I first started school. I still smile too much or get scared when people talk to me. I think the reason I sometimes feel sad is not because I miss people or can't communicate — it's because I have lost the social confidence that my ability to talk easily always gave me.

Elliot

When I first met Elliot, I was a young writer and he didn't pay attention to me. He always remembered faces, though, and if I saw him somewhere, he would shake my hand in a friendly way, but he didn't want to get to know me better. For example, if I saw him at the opera with an important person, he pretended not to see me. But then I had a big success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to like me more. One day, he sent me a note to invite me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, because my success brought me many new friends, I started to see him more often.

So, if a film is made the right way to create strong feelings, people in Japan should get scared at the same time as people in India.

Hitchcock's opinion of himself was always clear, logical, and hard to argue with. He was a sensible man and a very skilled filmmaker who enjoyed making audiences scream. He didn't work with guesses, unclear ideas, or smart references. His view of his own film characters was not deep. He focused only on film, pure film, and the cool, planned beauty of what film can do to people watching.","Surviving in a Foreign Land

284,"In those days the council houses stretched all over the western side of the city: row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer the chemicals from the May and Baker factory two miles away came and hung round the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur, and the most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting, or perhaps balancing, at any rate precariously, on some vantage point near an upstairs window, and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother, ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
That my mother should intrude into these early memories is no surprise. I remember her as a small, precise and nearly always angry woman, the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. Even as a child, though, accompanying her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer excursions into the city, I'm sure that I had some notion of the oddity of her personality.
She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which occasionally broke out in furious spring-cleanings or handwashings and instructions to 'behave proper'.
As a moral code this was completely beyond my comprehension: even now I'm not sure that I understand it. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked; it meant - oh, a hundred proscriptions and prohibitions.
In time other figures emerged onto these stern early scenes. For all her solitariness, my mother wasn't without her cronies. There was Mrs Buddery, who was fixated on the Royal Family, Mrs Winall, who said exactly nothing, except for grunts supporting the main speaker, and Mrs Laband - livelier than the others, and of whom they vaguely disapproved.
It was only later that I comprehended what poor company this trio was, they formed a depressed and depressing sisterhood, a little dribble of inconsequent talk about bad legs, the cold weather and the perils of ingrate children, a category in which I nearly always felt myself included.
Looking back, it was as if a giant paperweight, composed of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her cronies, the obligation to 'behave proper', lay across my shoulders, and that it was my duty immediately to grow up and start the work of prising it free.
This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet (I can remember awful aimless days, when I must have been about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat frostily in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.
The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat - these were extraordinary contraptions in cast-iron with improvised safety-straps. As far as I recall, my mother consigned me to the care of other children in the street for this journey.
If I remember anything about these early years it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught occasional glimpses of the world that existed outside West Earlham: a vague old man who lived next door to Mrs Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete, once, held at a house far away in Christchurch Road, where a motherly woman doled out lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity - a kind of junior charity, I think - only for my mother, to whom subsequent application was made, to dismiss the scheme on the grounds that its organisers were 'only after your money'.
Mercenary motives were a familiar theme of my mother's conversation, and politicians my mother held in the deepest contempt of all. If she thought of the House of Commons - and I am not sure if her mind was capable of such an unprecedented leap of the imagination - it was as a kind of opulent post office where plutocrats ripped open letters stuffed with five pound notes sent in by a credulous public.
No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I ignore her virtues and magnify her frailties. But there was precious little milk of human kindness in my mother, 
it had all been sucked out of her, sucked out and thrown away.
To do my mother justice she wasn't unconscious of her role as the guardian of my education. On Sundays occasionally, she would take me - in my 'good clothes' - on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Here, hand-in-hand, suspicious, but mindful of the free admission, we would parade through roomfuls of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists.
My mother wasn't, it must be known, altogether averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification. I can remember her stopping once in front of a fine study of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to remark, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as a solitary instance of my mother attempting to make a joke.",C2,,,"In those days, council houses were all over the west side of the city.

I don't remember much of my early life. But I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses going far into the distance. Later, other unclear memories come to me – faces I don't know, my mother ironing towels in a house that might not have been ours, snow falling on the big mansion at Earlham.

It's not surprising that my mother is in these early memories. I remember her as a small, tidy woman who was almost always angry. I never knew why she was angry, so I couldn't make her feel better. Even when I was young and went with her to shops in Bunnett Square or into the city, I felt there was something different about her.

She was the most alone person I have ever known. She seemed alone even with other people around her. She also had very strong ideas about behaving correctly, which was unusual in West Earlham. Sometimes this meant she cleaned everything angrily or told me to ""behave proper.""

I never understood her rules. For example, I couldn't walk into neighbours' gardens or hurt their flowers. I had to sit quietly for a long time in the dining room, listening to radio programmes she liked. There were many other rules like this.

Later, other people came into my life. Even though my mother liked being alone, she had friends. There was Mrs Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs Winall, who almost never spoke, and Mrs Laband – who was more fun than the others, though they didn't really like her.

Later, I understood they were not very good friends. They were a sad group who talked about small things like sore legs, cold weather, or children who weren't thankful – and I often felt I was one of those children.

Looking back, I felt like I had a heavy weight on my shoulders – made of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to ""behave proper."" I felt I needed to grow up fast and get away from it.

This was easier to say than to do. Growing up in West Earlham had a clear pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and sometimes bothered your parents. I remember boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat quietly in a chair. Then, after you turned five, you started at Avenue Road infants school half a mile away.

A few lucky children had a mother with a bike and a child seat – these were strange, heavy seats with simple straps. I think my mother let me walk to school with other children from our street.

If I remember anything from those early years, it's the summer holidays. On those days, I sometimes saw life outside West Earlham: an old man who lived next to Mrs Buddery told stories about working on ships; a charity event at a house far away in Christchurch Road, where a nice woman gave me lemonade and tried to get me to join the League of Pity – I think it was a charity for children. But when I asked my mother, she said no because she thought the people just wanted money.

My mother often thought people wanted money. She had no respect for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she probably saw it as a rich place where important people opened letters full of money from trusting people.

Maybe I am making this sound worse than it was. Maybe I am forgetting her good qualities and only remembering her bad ones. But my mother had very little kindness in her – it was like it had all been taken away.

To be fair, my mother did think about my education. Sometimes on Sundays, she took me – wearing my best clothes – on the bus to Norwich Castle Museum. We walked through rooms with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. She didn't mind this, and she even started to have thoughts about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!""

I never really understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her feel better.

This sometimes resulted in intense cleaning, frequent handwashing, and instructions to ""behave proper.""

As a moral code, this was completely beyond my understanding. Even now, I'm not sure I fully understand it. Specifically, it meant not walking into neighbours' gardens or damaging their rose bushes when walking down the street. It meant sitting quietly for long periods in the dining room, with my hands folded, listening to radio programmes my mother liked. It meant many other rules and restrictions.

Over time, other people appeared in these strict early memories. Despite her solitary nature, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was very interested in the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who hardly ever spoke except to agree with others, and Mrs. Laband—more lively than the others, though they seemed to disapprove of her slightly.

Only later did I realize what poor company these three women were. They formed a sad and depressing group, talking endlessly about unimportant things like health problems, cold weather, and ungrateful children—a group I often felt I belonged to.

Looking back, it felt as if a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her friends, and the need to ""behave proper,"" was on my shoulders. I felt it was my duty to grow up quickly and find a way to free myself from it.

This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at that time followed a clear pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and sometimes got in your parents' way.

It should be said that my mother didn't completely dislike this activity, and she eventually formed opinions about the art she saw.

285,"0ral History

The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian's social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia ('times were good then'), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, that is, in how the nerves, muscles and sense organs are coordinated to produce complex behaviour. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach, although they are often interested in the mechanisms of 'behaviour', study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Within the 'whole animal' approach, a distinction is often made between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists have traditionally worked in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists have been more concerned with the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals, often in their wild habitats. Although this distinction still exists to some extent, there is now a fruitful coming together of the two.
Among these types, it is the physiologists who like to emphasise that their methods are the more fundamental. However, even if we knew how every nerve cell operated in the performance of some pattern of behaviour, this would not remove the need for us to study it at a behavioural level also. Behaviour has its own organisation and its own units mat we must use for its study. Trying to describe the nest-building behaviour of a bird in terms of the actions of individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a page of a book with a high-powered microscope.

The Social Sciences

A problem facing all students who come to study a social science for the first time is that they must do two things simultaneously. They must familiarise themselves with the substance or content of their new subject and, at the same time, they must learn the methodology of the subject. That is, they must become familiar not only with the knowledge and research findings which fill the textbooks but also with the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised, that is with the logical basis of the subject itself. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related. Because we are all familiar with social life through our everyday experiences we may feel that the social sciences are very largely a matter of common-sense. But, as a look at any textbook will quickly indicate, though each of the social sciences is concerned with people in society, each discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, each uses particular methods of study and each employs its own set of concepts. It is this set of concepts, the most basic ideas in a subject, which constitutes the 'logical basis of the subject', which enables the social scientist to go beyond everyday common-sense and which distinguishes one discipline from another.

Classical Architecture

To the classical world, that of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings. 'Architecture', says the Roman architect Vitruvius, 'consists of Order, and of Arrangement, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Propriety and Distribution.' For several of these terms he gives a Greek equivalent: his definitions probably derived from an earlier Greek authority whose writings are lost to us. Utility and Function are not part of this definition, though in his book Vitruvius does go on to describe the best form and arrangements for different purposes of structure; but here, at the beginning, the aesthetic emphasis, architecture as an art, has priority. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was obviously a long prehistory of basic construction, of hut habitations simple in form and material, both in Greece and Italy, which did not match up to Vitruvius' artistic requirements. Though these were, by definition, inartistic they nevertheless contributed an essential element of form, which persisted into the later sophisticated architectural concepts. However orate it may appear from the outside, in essence the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.",C2,,,"**Oral History**

More and more, historians are using people's spoken stories as evidence. But this has some problems. We should not think that a person's story is a perfect memory of the past. In an interview, the historian and the speaker affect each other. The historian chooses the person and the topic. Even if the historian only listens, their being there changes how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is shaped by the historian's own background and ideas about history. This means that historians are part of creating the evidence.

But there are more problems. The person telling the story is also not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be changed by things they heard from other people or from the news. They might remember the past as a very good time, or they might feel angry about a hard childhood, even if that anger came later in life. The feelings in the story can make it sound true, but these feelings might be from a later time, not from the past they are talking about.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science.

The first way is physiology. These scientists study how the animal's body works. They look at how the nerves, muscles, and senses work together to make behaviour.

The second way is the 'whole animal' approach. These scientists study the complete animal and what changes its behaviour. They are also interested in how the behaviour happens.

In the 'whole animal' group, there are two types of scientists: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in laboratories. They study how a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons, learn. Ethologists study the natural behaviour of animals in the wild. This is behaviour the animals are born with. Today, these two groups are working together more.

The physiologists often say their way is the most important. But, even if we knew everything about how nerve cells work, we would still need to study the behaviour itself. Behaviour has its own patterns. Trying to explain how a bird builds a nest by only looking at nerve cells is like trying to read a book with a microscope. It doesn't work well.

**The Social Sciences**

Students who are new to social science have a problem. They must learn two things together. First, they must learn the facts and information of the subject. Second, they must learn the methods of the subject. This means they need to know what is in the textbooks and also how people found that information.

These two parts are connected. Because we all live in society, we might think social science is just common sense. But if you open a textbook, you will see it is more than that. Each social science subject looks at a different part of social life. Each one uses its own way of studying and has its own main ideas. These main ideas are the 'logical basis' of the subject. They help the social scientist understand more than common sense and make each subject special.

**Classical Architecture**

For the ancient Greeks and Romans, architecture was more than just building buildings. A Roman architect named Vitruvius said that architecture is about Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, and Distribution. He probably got some of these ideas from a Greek writer, but that writer's work is lost. Vitruvius's definition does not talk about how useful a building is, but later in his book he does talk about the best shapes for different buildings. At the start, the most important thing is beauty—architecture as an art.

The start of classical architecture is not simple. Long before, in Greece and Italy, people lived in very simple huts. These huts were made from basic materials and were not beautiful like Vitruvius wanted. But these simple huts gave a basic shape that was used in later, more beautiful buildings. So, even though a classical temple looks very fancy from the outside, its basic form is really just a simple hut with one room.","**Oral History**

Historians increasingly use spoken accounts as evidence, but this creates some difficulties. We cannot assume that a person's story perfectly captures past events, because in an interview, both people influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens and doesn't ask questions, their presence changes the atmosphere and affects how the person remembers and talks about the past. The final story is shaped by the historian's own background and their way of understanding history, which they might unintentionally share with the person they are interviewing. This means historians must recognise their own role in creating new historical evidence.

The challenges don't end there. The person telling the story is also not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be changed by things they have heard from other sources, like the media. They might remember the past as better than it was, or their memories could be affected by later feelings of unhappiness about their childhood. For a listener, the emotions in the story can make it seem very believable, but these feelings might actually come from later life, not from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works—how the nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create behaviour. Scientists who take the 'whole animal' approach study the complete behaviour of the animal and the things that influence it, though they are also often interested in how this behaviour works.

Within the 'whole animal' approach, we often separate psychologists from ethologists. Psychologists have usually worked in laboratories, studying how a small number of species, like rats and pigeons, learn. Ethologists have been more interested in the natural, instinctive behaviour of animals, often in the wild. While this difference still exists, the two fields are now productively working together.

Physiologists often like to point out that their methods are the most basic. However, even if we understood how every nerve cell worked during a specific behaviour, we would still need to study the behaviour itself. Behaviour has its own patterns and units that we must use to study it. Trying to describe a bird's nest-building by looking only at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book page with a powerful microscope—you would see the tiny details but miss the overall meaning.

**The Social Sciences**

A challenge for all new social science students is that they have to do two things at the same time. They need to learn the content of their new subject, and they also need to learn its methodology. This means they must become familiar not only with the information and research findings in textbooks but also with the methods used to get and organise that knowledge—the logical foundation of the subject. These two parts are closely connected.

Because we all experience social life every day, we might think the social sciences are just common sense. However, a quick look at any textbook shows that while each social science is about people in society, each one goes beyond everyday understanding. Each discipline looks at a specific part of social life, uses its own study methods, and has its own set of basic ideas, or concepts. It is this set of concepts—the most fundamental ideas in a subject—that forms its 'logical basis'. This is what allows social scientists to move past common sense and what makes each discipline unique.

**Classical Architecture**

In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was much more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. For some of these terms, he used Greek words, likely taking his ideas from an earlier Greek writer whose work is now lost. While usefulness and function are not part of this main definition, Vitruvius does later describe the best forms and layouts for different types of buildings. But here, at the start, the focus is on beauty—architecture as an art.

The origins of classical architecture are complicated. There was a long earlier history of simple building, with basic huts made from simple materials in both Greece and Italy. These did not meet Vitruvius's artistic standards. Even though they were not considered artistic, they provided an essential basic form that continued into later, more advanced architectural ideas. No matter how decorated it looks from the outside, a classical temple is, in its basic form, a simple, one-room hut.","**Oral History**

Historians' increasing use of oral evidence presents certain difficulties. It is unrealistic to believe that a person's account provides a pure record of past events, because in any interview both people influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and sets the topic of conversation; even if they remain silent and only listen, the interviewer's presence changes the environment in which memories are recalled and shared. The final account is shaped by both the historian's social relationship with the speaker and by the historical perspectives they use—which may be subtly communicated during the conversation. Essentially, historians must recognize their part in producing new historical evidence.

However, the challenges continue even after the interview ends. The speaker themselves does not have direct access to the past. Their memories may be influenced by information from other sources—particularly the media—or may be affected by nostalgia for ""better times."" Alternatively, memories might be changed by later feelings about difficult childhood experiences that only became significant in adulthood. For listeners, the emotions and attitudes expressed often make the account seem believable, yet these feelings might come from later life experiences rather than from the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**

Animal science is generally studied from two main viewpoints: the physiological approach and the whole-animal approach. Physiologists mainly investigate how the body functions—specifically how nerves, muscles, and sensory organs work together to produce complex behaviors. Those who take the whole-animal approach, while sometimes interested in how behaviors work, study the behavior of complete animals and the factors that influence it.

Within the whole-animal approach, psychologists and ethologists are often distinguished. Psychologists have typically worked in laboratories, studying the learning abilities of a small number of species, particularly rats and pigeons. Ethologists have focused more on animals' natural, unlearned behaviors, often in their wild environments. Although this distinction still exists to some extent, the two fields are now productively combining.

Among these groups, physiologists often stress that their methods are more basic to understanding. However, even if we understood exactly how every nerve cell worked during a particular behavior, we would still need to study that behavior at its own level. Behavior has its own organization and its own elements that we must use when studying it. Trying to describe a bird's nest-building behavior only in terms of nerve cells would be like trying to read a book page using a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**

A key challenge for students new to social sciences is that they must learn two things at the same time. They need to understand the actual content of their subject while also learning its research methods. This means becoming familiar not only with the information and research results in textbooks, but also with how this knowledge is collected and organized—that is, the logical foundation of the subject. These two aspects are closely connected.

Because we all experience social life daily, we might think social sciences are mostly common sense. However, as any textbook shows, while each social science studies people in society, each field goes beyond everyday understanding. Each discipline examines a particular area of social life, uses specific research methods, and has its own set of key ideas. It is this group of basic concepts—the logical foundation of the subject—that allows social scientists to move beyond common sense and that makes each discipline distinct.

**Classical Architecture**

In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture meant much more than simply putting up buildings. The Roman architect Vitruvius wrote that ""Architecture consists of Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Appropriateness, and Layout."" For several of these terms he gives Greek equivalents; his definitions probably came from an earlier Greek writer whose works are lost. Practical use and function aren't included in this basic definition, though Vitruvius does later describe the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. Here, at the beginning, the focus is on beauty—architecture as an art comes first.

The beginnings of classical architecture are complicated. Both Greece and Italy had a long history of basic building, with simple huts made from ordinary materials that didn't meet Vitruvius's artistic standards. Although these early structures weren't artistic, they provided important design elements that continued into later, more developed architecture. No matter how decorative it looks from the outside, the classical temple is essentially a simple hut with one room.",
286,"Music - The Challenge Ahead

Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work, at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain.

In the latter part of the 20th century, we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. Along with this, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians.
There seems little doubt that the widening access to music is likely to continue, fulfilling as it does so many human needs. On a national level, no major state occasion is without music. For individuals, it provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal.
Indeed, a society without music is surely unthinkable and it seems that the issue is not whether there will be music in the 21st century but what the nature of that music will be, and also whether there will be a continued perceived need for people to learn to play musical instruments.
I would respond to the latter question on a positive note. The music industry is one of the major generators of income in Britain and musical skill and talent will continue to be important in preparing individuals to work in a variety of professions, in particular those related to the media.
In addition to its vocational significance, there is a growing body of evidence that playing an instrument may be beneficial to the development of skills at an earlier stage. Research in the USA has suggested that listening to or actively making music has a direct positive effect on spatial reasoning, one aspect of the measurement of intelligence.
While these results are still to be successfully replicated, other data from Europe has indicated that an increase in group music lessons can have positive effects on social relationships in school and on concentration in young children and those with behavioural difficulties.
Taking the idea behind such findings one step further, current research is investigating to what extent playing an instrument may even encourage the development of transferable skills. For instance, the need to practise regularly may assist in the acquisition of good study habits and focused concentration, playing in concerts may encourage habits of punctuality and good organisation.
For all these reasons, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. What about the longer term picture? Is there likely to be a shift in focus and, if so, what direction will it take?
While there are many possible scenarios, I believe that two possibilities are likely. Firstly, the kinds of music to which people will listen will become more diverse. New genres will develop which will integrate different styles. Secondly, there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. This will widen access to composition as there will be less reliance on technical skill but at the same time, it is likely to further reduce the need for live performance and musicians whose role is solely related to it.
Developing in parallel with this trend is a likely increase in the number of people, across the whole age range, who wish to actively participate in music making. Such activities are likely to be community based and will reflect the musical traditions of that community whatever they may be.
If this vision of the future is to be realised, what does the music profession need to do in preparation? The focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. 
As a result, the impact on the instrumental curriculum and the measures used to assess progress through it will be such that they will need to adapt to maintain their relevance for a broader sector of the population. Ultimately, they will need to encompass a wider range of musical skills.
Crucial to the success of the process will be the training of musicians. They will need to be able to motivate, inspire and teach learners of all ages, develop skills for working with large and diverse groups and acquire the communication, social, entrepreneurial and management skills necessary for community work.
This represents a fundamental change from traditional practice and it will be accompanied by the need to respond to demands for public accountability. Viewed positively, this should provide an opportunity for all those involved in music education to demonstrate the high quality of music tuition available.
Finally, we need to strive towards raising the profile of music itself. Music plays a crucial role in our lives but all too often it is taken for granted. Those involved in the music profession at all levels need to work actively together to ensure that this changes.
",C2,"Music - What Comes Next

Technology changes our lives. It changes work, home, and fun. Susan Hallam talks about music in Britain.

Now, we have many ways to hear music. We use radio, TV, and phones. But not many people play music for others to see. Also, not many musicians have jobs to play music.

People like music. Big events have music. People do things with music. A world with no music is not good. The question is: what music will we have? And will people learn to play instruments?

I think yes. Music makes money in Britain. Playing music is good for jobs.

Also, playing an instrument helps children. It helps them think. It helps them learn.

Music with other children helps too. It helps children be friends. It helps children listen.

Playing an instrument teaches other things. You must practice. This helps you learn. Playing for people teaches you to be on time.

So, people will want to learn instruments now. But later? Will it change?

I think two things. One, people will hear more kinds of music. New music will mix sounds. Two, people will use computers to make music. This is easy for many people. But we may not need so many live musicians.

Also, more people may want to play music. Old people and young people. They will play music in their town.

If this happens, music teachers must change. They must help more people learn instruments all their life.

Lessons and tests must change too. They must be good for everyone. They must teach more music skills.

We must teach musicians well. They must be good teachers for all people. They must work with many people. They must talk well with people.

This is a big change. People want good teaching. This is a chance for music teachers to show they are good.

Last, we must tell people music is important. Music is in our life, but people forget. All music people must work to change this.","Music - What Comes Next

Technology changes how we live. It changes our work, our homes, and our fun. Susan Hallam talks about how it changes music in Britain.

In the late 1900s, people found new ways to listen to music. They used the radio, TV, and CDs. But fewer people played music for others to hear. Also, fewer musicians had full-time jobs.

People will always listen to music. It is important to them. Big national events always have music. For one person, music is part of many activities.

A world with no music is impossible. The question is not if we will have music, but what kind of music it will be. Also, will people still want to learn to play instruments?

I think the answer is yes. The music business makes a lot of money in Britain. Knowing how to play music is good for getting jobs, especially in TV and radio.

Also, playing an instrument can help children learn. Studies in the USA say that listening to music or playing music can help you think better.

Other studies from Europe show that group music lessons can help children be friends. It can also help them pay attention in class. This is good for children who have trouble behaving.

New studies are looking at how playing an instrument helps you learn other skills. For example, practising a lot can teach you how to study well. Playing in a concert can teach you to be on time.

For these reasons, people will probably still want to learn instruments soon. But what about later? Will things change?

I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to more kinds of music. New music will mix different styles. Second, people will use more technology to make and play music. This will let more people write music, even if they are not very good players. But it might also mean we need fewer live musicians.

Also, more people of all ages will want to play music themselves. They will do this in groups in their town. They will play the music that their community likes.

If this is the future, what must music teachers do? They need to change how they teach. They need to help more people learn to play different instruments, even when they are adults.

Because of this, music lessons and tests must change too. They must be good for more people. They must include more music skills.

It is very important to train musicians well. They will need to help students of all ages want to learn. They must know how to work with big groups and different people. They need to be good at talking to others for community work.

This is a big change from the past. People will also want to know that music teaching is good. This is a chance for music teachers to show that their work is important.

Finally, we need to show people that music is very important. Music is a big part of our lives, but people often forget this. Everyone in music must work together to change this.","Music - The Challenge Ahead

Technology is changing our lives at work, at home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain.

In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music. They used radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and new media. At the same time, fewer people went to live concerts, and fewer musicians had full-time jobs.

It is clear that people will keep listening to music because it is important to them. Big national events always have music. For people, music is part of many activities, both formal and informal.

A world without music is impossible to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be. Another question is whether people will still want to learn to play instruments.

I think the answer is yes. The music business makes a lot of money in Britain. Being good at music will still help people get jobs, especially in media.

Also, there is more proof that playing an instrument can help children learn better. Research in the USA shows that listening to music or playing it can help with thinking skills, which is part of being intelligent.

Other studies from Europe say that group music lessons can help children get along better at school and help them pay attention, especially children who find it hard to behave.

New research is looking at whether playing an instrument helps people learn skills they can use in other areas. For example, practising regularly can teach good study habits. Playing in concerts can teach people to be on time and organised.

For all these reasons, people will probably still want to learn instruments in the near future. But what about later? Will things change, and how?

I think two things might happen. First, people will listen to more different kinds of music. New styles will mix different types of music. Second, people will use more technology to write and play music. This will let more people write music because they won't need as much skill. But it might also mean we need fewer live musicians.

At the same time, more people of all ages might want to play music themselves. This will probably happen in local groups and will show the music traditions of those places.

If this is the future, what should music teachers do to get ready? The way we teach instruments needs to change. We need to find ways for more people to learn to play different instruments at any age.

Because of this, what we teach and how we check progress must change too. It must be useful for more people. In the end, it should include a wider range of music skills.

Training musicians will be very important. They will need to be able to encourage and teach learners of all ages. They must learn to work with big, different groups and have good communication and management skills for community work.

This is a big change from the past. People will also want to know that music teaching is good. This is a chance for everyone in music education to show that the teaching is of high quality.

Finally, we need to make people notice music more. Music is very important in our lives, but people often forget this. Everyone in the music world must work together to change this.","Music - The Challenge Ahead

Technology continues to change our lives at work, at home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam looks at how this affects music in Britain.

In the late 20th century, people had many more ways to listen to music because of radio, television, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia. At the same time, there were fewer live music performances, and professional musicians had fewer full-time jobs.

It is clear that people will continue to have more access to music because it is important for many human needs. On a national level, no important state event happens without music. For individuals, music offers chances for many different activities, both formal and informal.

A society without music is impossible to imagine. The real questions for the 21st century are what type of music there will be and whether people will still think it is important to learn to play musical instruments.

I feel positive about the second question. The music industry earns a lot of money for Britain, and musical skills and talent will continue to be useful for preparing people for different jobs, especially in media.

Besides work, there is more and more evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills in young people. Research in the USA shows that both listening to music and making music can improve spatial reasoning, which is one way to measure intelligence.

Although we need more studies to be sure, information from Europe shows that more group music lessons can help social relationships in schools and improve concentration in young children and those with behavior problems.

Researchers are now studying whether playing an instrument might help people learn skills they can use in other areas. For example, regular practice might help develop good study habits and focus, while playing in concerts might teach people to be on time and organized.

For all these reasons, people will probably continue to want instrumental lessons in the near future. But what about later? Will things change, and if so, how?

Many things could happen, but I think two are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied. New styles will appear that mix different kinds of music. Second, technology will be used more for composing and performing music. This will make it easier for people to compose music because they will need less technical skill, but it might also mean fewer live performances and fewer jobs for musicians who only perform.

At the same time, more people of all ages will probably want to take part in making music themselves. These activities will likely happen in local communities and will show the musical traditions of those communities.

If we want this future to happen, what should the music profession do to get ready? The way we teach instruments will need to change. We need to find ways to help more people learn to play different instruments throughout their lives.

Because of this, music courses and how we measure progress will need to change to be useful for more people. In the end, they will need to include a wider variety of musical skills.

Training musicians will be very important for this to work. Musicians will need to be able to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work well with large and diverse groups, and learn the communication, social, business, and management skills needed for community work.

This is a big change from how things were done before, and it will require showing the public that music education is valuable. If we look at it positively, this is a chance for everyone in music education to show how good music teaching can be.

Finally, we need to work to make music more visible. Music is very important in our lives, but people often don't notice it. Everyone involved in music needs to work together to change this.",,
287,"'You don't take sugar, do you? shouted his secretary, not so much asking a question as stating a fact - as well she might, because she had been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn't normally supposed to be there. Actually nowadays he was usually there all the time, having discovered that to take up his proprietorial privilege of staying away was tantamount to opening the floodgates. Not for the first time he pondered the easy, imperceptibly divided stages by which he had progressed from valued counsellor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch at carefully planned planning meetings complete with agenda, to hapless dogsbody moving one step ahead of catastrophe, with nowhere to park when he arrived at work in the mornings.
'This came,' she yelled, vaguely waving a manila folder before putting it down in front of him. 'From that chap in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it.' A typed label said: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Just under that it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see that word 'synopsis'. At the very least he wanted to see a label saying 'A First Draft'. Lancelot had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not really want to see another, however heavily revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given an advance of several thousands of pounds for this book during the initial flurry of activity when Lancelot had bought the firm. One of several old friends from whom Lancelot had made the capital error of commissioning books, Ian Cuthbert was a particularly flagrant proof that in such circumstances the possessor of a wayward temperament, far from nerving himself to behave more predictably for friendship's sake, will actually become less 'pindownable' than ever.
Lancelot skipped the blurb come preamble which he had read for what seemed like the hundredth time and sampled the synopsis proper. There was scarcely a phrase that he did not recognise at a glance. He closed the folder and shifted it to one side. Plainly at this rate Ian's manuscript would never be forthcoming. As well as almost wholly lacking the brilliance for which its author was supposed to be famous, the synopsis, under its doggedly frolicsome tone, had the unmistakable dead ring of a lost conviction. Lancelot remembered tales of a famous author-about-town whose last book, published incomplete after his death, had been coaxed from him chapter by chapter, one payment at a time. But in that case, the payments were fractions of a hypothetical advance which had never been given in the first place. Ian's advance had been enormous; a blatant reversal of the sound business principle by which authors must deliver a manuscript now in order to be paid with inflated currency later.
Lancelot, who had read modern languages at Oxford, could remember the day when Ian Cuthbert had been the most promising talent in a Cambridge so full of promise that it had made everywhere else feel provincial. Ian's contemporaries had plotted to take over the British theatre and in a remarkably short time they had actually done so. But their mental energy had seemed like indolence when you looked at Ian. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about what one very famous French writer had said as if he had been there to overhear it. Yet for some reason, the whole frostily coruscating galaxy of Ian's creative intellect had remained locked in its closet. While less gifted deviants came out and conquered, Ian went further in. At the height of his influence as a literary taste-maker he was already notoriously difficult to deal with. Officially appointed by the relevant public agency to edit a comprehensive magazine of the arts, he was like a general with a million tons of equipment pinned down on the beach by nothing except an excess of opportunity. The magazine used up the budget for a dozen issues without appearing once. Similarly, his thrice-renewed three-year contract with one of the fashion magazines engendered little except legends about the size of his emolument, which was increased from generosity to extravagance in an attempt to make him produce more, and then from extravagance to munificence in an attempt to make him produce anything. At the editorial working breakfasts - there were always at least two of the titled photographers present to capture the scene for posterity - Ian spat witty venom through clenched teeth, and poured nitric acid on other people's ideas. Ten years later, he could scarcely be depended upon to turn up for his own funeral. Lancelot was on the verge of admitting to himself that 'A World History of the Short' had been a mistake from its inception.",C2,,,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" his secretary called out. She wasn't really asking a question, just saying what she knew was true. She had made coffee for Lancelot for many months. She sometimes forgot things because he wasn't usually meant to be in the office. But now he was always there. He had learned that if he stayed away, things went wrong.

He thought about how his job had changed. Before, he was an important advisor who met authors for lunch. Now, he felt like a helper who was always trying to stop problems before they happened. He even had trouble finding a place to park his car.

""Here,"" she said, waving a folder before giving it to him. ""It's from that man in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The folder had a label that said: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Under that, it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see the word 'synopsis'. He wanted it to say 'A First Draft'. He had already seen one synopsis for this book and did not want to see another one.

Ian Cuthbert was an old friend. Lancelot had asked him to write a book and gave him a lot of money before it was finished. This was a big mistake. Ian was not a reliable person. Instead of working harder because they were friends, he became even more difficult to work with.

Lancelot quickly looked at the new pages. He saw that almost everything was the same as before. He closed the folder and put it aside. It was clear that Ian would never finish the book. The writing was not very good, and it seemed like Ian didn't really believe in his own idea anymore.

Lancelot remembered a story about another famous writer. That writer only finished his book when he was paid a little money at a time. But Ian had already been given all his money at the start. This was the opposite of how things should work. Usually, an author finishes the book first and gets paid later.

Lancelot thought back to when they were younger. Ian was the most talented student at Cambridge University. Everyone thought he would be very successful. His friends took over the British theatre world very quickly. But Ian, who always wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers, never did anything important. While other less talented people became successful, Ian did less and less.

When Ian was a famous magazine editor, he was already very difficult. He was given a big budget to make a new arts magazine, but he never produced even one issue. He had a large contract with a fashion magazine, but he produced almost nothing. At meetings, he would say clever but unkind things about other people's ideas. Now, ten years later, you couldn't even be sure he would come to his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to think that asking Ian to write this book was a bad idea from the very beginning.","""You don't take sugar, do you?"" his secretary called out. She wasn't really asking a question, just stating something she already knew. After all, she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for sometimes forgetting was that he wasn't normally meant to be in the office. But these days, he was almost always there. He had learned that if he used his owner's right to stay away, it caused many problems.

He thought again about how his role had changed so gradually. He had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors for planned lunches with clear agendas, to a helpless assistant who was always trying to stop disasters from happening. He didn't even have a place to park when he arrived at work in the morning.

""This arrived,"" she said loudly, waving a brown folder before placing it on his desk. ""It's from that man in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A typed label on it read: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Just below that, it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see the word 'synopsis'. He wanted it to at least say 'A First Draft'. He had already seen one summary of this book and did not want to see another, even if it was changed a lot.

Ian Cuthbert had been given thousands of pounds in advance for this book when Lancelot first bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly asked to write a book. Ian was a clear example that in these situations, a person with an unpredictable character does not become more reliable because of friendship. Instead, they become even harder to manage.

Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he felt he had read a hundred times, and looked at the main summary. There was almost nothing in it that was new to him. He closed the folder and moved it aside. It was obvious that at this rate, Ian's book would never be finished. The summary not only lacked the cleverness the author was famous for, but it also sounded like the writer had lost all belief in his own work.

Lancelot remembered stories of a famous writer whose last book was published unfinished after he died. The writer had been persuaded to write it chapter by chapter, with a small payment for each one. But in that case, the payments were parts of an advance that was never actually paid in full. Ian's advance, however, had been very large. This went against the sensible business rule that authors should finish a book first before they are paid a large amount.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, could remember when Ian Cuthbert was considered the most promising young writer at Cambridge. At that time, Cambridge was so full of talent that it made other places seem less important. Ian's university friends had planned to take over British theatre, and they had actually done it very quickly. But compared to Ian, their energy seemed lazy. Ian had a unique style and talked about famous French writers as if he had been there with them.

Yet for some reason, Ian's great creative mind never produced the work people expected. While other less talented people became successful, Ian seemed to withdraw. At the peak of his influence as someone who shaped literary taste, he was already known for being very difficult to work with. He was officially chosen to edit a major arts magazine, but he was like a general with a huge army who couldn't move because he had too many choices. The magazine spent the budget for twelve issues without ever publishing one.

In the same way, his three-year contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times but produced very little. Instead, it created stories about how much he was paid. His pay was increased from generous to extravagant to try to make him work more, and then from extravagant to enormous to try to make him produce anything at all. At editorial breakfast meetings, which always had famous photographers there to record the event, Ian would make sharp, clever comments and strongly criticize other people's ideas.

Ten years later, you couldn't even be sure he would show up to his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting to himself that 'A World History of the Short' had been a bad idea from the very beginning.","""You don't take sugar, do you?"" his secretary called out, stating it as a fact rather than asking a question—understandably, since she had been making Lancelot's coffee for many months. She excused such forgetfulness by saying he wasn't normally meant to be there. In fact, he was now almost always present, having learned that using his privilege as owner to stay away was like inviting trouble. Not for the first time, he considered the gradual steps by which he had moved from valued advisor—meeting authors and playwrights over lunch in well-organized meetings—to overworked assistant, constantly avoiding disaster and without even a parking space when he arrived at work.

""This came,"" she announced, vaguely waving a manila folder before setting it in front of him. ""From that man in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A typed label read: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Just below, it said 'An Expanded Synopsis.' Lancelot did not want to see the word 'synopsis.' At the very least, he would have preferred a label saying 'First Draft.' He had already seen one synopsis of this book and had little interest in another, no matter how much it had been revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given an advance of several thousand pounds for the book during the initial excitement when Lancelot bought the company. One of several old friends from whom Lancelot had made the serious mistake of commissioning books, Ian Cuthbert was clear proof that in such situations, a person with an unpredictable nature will not try to act more reliably out of friendship, but will instead become even harder to pin down.

Lancelot skipped the introduction, which he felt he had read countless times, and looked at the actual synopsis. There was hardly a phrase he did not recognize immediately. He closed the folder and moved it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never be completed. Not only did the synopsis mostly lack the brilliance for which its author was known, but beneath its determinedly lively tone was the clear emptiness of lost belief. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous socialite author whose final book, published unfinished after his death, had been obtained from him chapter by chapter, with payment made in stages. In that case, however, the payments were parts of a possible advance that had never actually been given. Ian's advance, on the other hand, had been very large—a clear reversal of the sensible business practice where authors must provide a manuscript first to be paid later with money that had lost value.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, could remember when Ian Cuthbert had been considered the most promising talent in a Cambridge so full of potential that it made other places seem provincial. Ian's contemporaries had planned to take over British theatre, and in a surprisingly short time, they had actually done so. But their mental energy seemed lazy compared to Ian's. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about what a very famous French writer had said as if he had been there to hear it. Yet for some reason, the whole shining range of Ian's creative mind had stayed hidden. While less talented outsiders came forward and succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the height of his influence as a literary trendsetter, he was already known for being difficult to work with. Officially chosen by a public organization to edit a major arts magazine, he was like a general with huge resources trapped on the beach by too many choices. The magazine used up the budget for twelve issues without one ever appearing. Similarly, his three-year contract with a fashion magazine, renewed three times, produced little except stories about his large salary, which was increased from generous to extravagant to make him produce more, and then from extravagant to extremely generous to make him produce anything at all. At editorial breakfasts—always with at least two famous photographers there to record the event—Ian would make sharp, clever comments through clenched teeth and harshly criticize other people's ideas. Ten years later, you could not even depend on him to attend his own funeral. Lancelot was nearly ready to admit to himself that 'A World History of the Short' had been a mistake from the start.",

Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, and the chances are they'll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations, from computers to encyclopaedias.
Most people know little of what Einstein did, except that he developed some mysterious theories under the heading 'relativity', which are famous for being incomprehensible, and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience.
Einstein was part of a gigantic leap forward in scientific thinking, an intellectual revolution that heralded the birth of twentieth century science. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature.
Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy. Previous descriptions had depended on Isaac Newton's view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

Throughout our childhoods, Lydia and I distrusted any prize-winning book because we knew it would be worthy; and for 'worthy', read 'boring', we thought.
While our mother had been inclined to abhor our philistinism in tones of despising innuendo, our father would cheerfully dish us out tenpences, chapter by chapter, as inducements to make us cast our eyes over the occasional improving volume. Or he would slip the odd superior book in amongst our Christmas and birthday presents, labelled in bold marker pen, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Though we dismissed most of his offerings as 'boys' books', he did, in this way, expose us to some shorter works of decent fiction and, just once, to a well-known anthology of verse.

Language

'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous', wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. The marvellous secret has long proved a launch pad for strange ideas. 'Primitive man was likely to make sounds like ""meuh"" when sensing danger,' claimed Charles Caller in 1928. ""Meuh"" has a plaintive sound. The human who wandered over a hostile land inhabited by awesome beasts uttered desperate noises, and languages have preserved some echo of his lamentation such as malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"".
Faced with such weird speculations, many avoided the topic, regarding it as a playground for cranks, but recently, language origin and evolution have become key research areas. Language probably developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. In the main speech was used for friendly interaction, and was an important tool in power struggles. Information-swapping was probably not an important original role - contrary to the views of philosopher John Locke, who spoke of language as a 'great conduit' for conveying knowledge.",C2,,,"**Einstein**

Einstein was part of a huge change in science. This big change was the start of modern science in the twentieth century. Scientists and mathematicians were trying to explain the universe in a new, better way by looking at how things and natural forces are connected.

Einstein made his important discoveries by thinking about simple, basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people used Isaac Newton's idea of the universe, where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea. He said that time and space are not fixed; they are relative.

Our mother did not like our simple taste in books and often made comments about it. Our father, however, had a different way. To make us read better books, he would give us a little money for each chapter we finished. Sometimes, he would hide a good book among our Christmas or birthday presents. On the cover, he would write in big letters: 'This Book is NOT Literature'. We usually thought his book choices were for boys, but because of him, we read some good short stories and, one time, a famous book of poems.

For example, in 1928, Charles Caller said that early people probably made a sound like ""meuh"" when they were in danger. He said ""meuh"" sounds sad. He thought that early humans, who lived in a dangerous world with big animals, made desperate sounds. He believed that some words in our languages today, like 'malaria' (which means 'fever') or the Latin word 'mors' (which means 'death'), still have the sound of that early sadness.

Because of these strange ideas, many people avoided talking about where language came from. They thought only crazy people were interested in it. But recently, the origin and change of language have become very important for research. Language probably first appeared in East Africa about 100,000 years ago.

289,"Vervet monkeys

Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger's intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. If he succeeded, it was more than likely that the incumbent male would be ousted from his position of privilege. With the vervet equivalent of a stroke of genius, the male hit on the ideal ploy to keep the stranger away from his group. As soon as the strange male descended from the grove of trees to try to cross the open ground that separated his grove from the one in which the group was feeding, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to signal the sighting of a leopard nearby. The stranger shot back into the safety of his trees. As the day wore on, this was repeated every time the stranger made a move in the groups direction. All was going swimmingly until the male made a crucial mistake: after successfully using the ploy several times, he gave the leopard alarm call while himself nonchalantly walking across open ground.

What Cats Catch

In a recent survey, people in the 173-household English village of Felmersham collected their cats' prey. Over one year their seventy cats produced over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America saw these figures and worked out that on this basis the cat population of Britain must be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year!
The mesmeric effect of big numbers seems to have stultified reason. It is not realistic just to multiply the number of catches of these rural cats by the entire cat population of Britain. Most cats are town cats with small ranges, and catch fewer items of prey than the cats in this survey. The key question should have been this: are the numbers sustainable? The answer would seem to be yes.
In winter many householders feed birds, while garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, and in this way the bird population is kept at well above 'natural' levels. The survey found that the cat is a significant predator, but not that it is devastating Britain's bird population.

Buffalo's Day

The buffaloes are, as it were, the marshman's lifeline, and they are cherished accordingly. At each dawn the buffaloes, who have been sleeping on the buffalo platform or quite frequently round the fire with their owners, leave, infinitely slowly and wearily, their wallowing progress continually punctuated with despairing groans, for the distant reed beds beyond the open water. For a long time they stand on the edge of the platform, groaning to each other of the infinite fatigue of the coming day, until at last the leader takes a ponderous pace forward and subsides into the water.
Once in the water a deep lassitude once more descends upon the party, as if they had by now forgotten their intention and they may wallow there with low notes of complaint for many minutes. The movements that at length remove them from the immediate vicinity of the house are so gradual as to pass practically unnoticed, but finally they are swimming, so low in the water that their noses seem held above it by a last effort of ebbing strength, their rolling eyes proclaiming that this is the end at last and that they are drowning. So, patient and protesting and more or less submerged, they spend the day among the reeds and the bulrushes, grazing leisurely upon such green shoots as their antediluvian heads may find at eye level.

PICASSO, Pablo 

The soles 1940 Oil on canvas Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art

Picasso tended to paint those things that surrounded him, and in the early spring of 1940, he painted several fish still lifes while he was staying in the fishing port of Royan. The ostensible subject of the painting is a fishmonger's slab with a crab, and a pair of scales containing two or three soles. In spite of their predicament these sea creatures look very much still alive. It is not very easy to read the painting because Picasso has treated the composition in terms of a flat pattern of overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. This, the thin delicately brushed paint, and the cool, undemonstrative colours give the painting the appearance of an underwater world of slow-moving calm and harmony. But this is disturbed by what seems to be an impending battle between the fish, baring their teeth, and the crab, with its open claws. Those sharp, pointed forms are echoed by the scales. Even the chain going round one of the fish takes on a more sinister aspect. There is an undercurrent of menace and barely suppressed violence that gives the picture a symbolic edge.
",C2,,"**Vervet Monkeys**

A scientist watched a group of vervet monkeys. The leader monkey saw a new male monkey nearby. The new monkey wanted to join the group. The leader did not want this. He had a clever idea. When the new monkey came closer, the leader made a special call. This call means ""a leopard is near."" The new monkey was scared and ran away. The leader did this many times. But then the leader made a big mistake. He made the leopard call while he was walking in the open. This showed the other monkeys he was lying.

**What Cats Catch**

People in an English village watched what their cats brought home. Their 70 cats caught over 1,000 animals in one year. An American professor saw this. He thought all the cats in Britain must kill 100 million birds and small animals every year.

But this is not a good way to think. Most cats live in towns. They catch fewer animals than village cats. The important question is: are there still enough birds? The answer seems to be yes.

In winter, people give food to birds. Gardens give birds safe places to live. So, the bird population is high. Cats do catch many birds, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.

**Buffalo's Day**

Buffaloes are very important to the people who live in the marshes. The people take good care of them.

Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping area. They move very, very slowly to the water. They make sad noises. They stand for a long time, groaning about the long day ahead. Finally, the first buffalo walks into the water.

In the water, they become slow and lazy again. They seem to forget where they are going. They move so slowly you hardly see them move. Soon they are swimming. They are very low in the water. They look very tired, like they are drowning. They spend the whole day like this in the water, eating green plants.

**PICASSO, Pablo**

**The Soles, 1940**

Picasso liked to paint the things he saw around him. In 1940, he was in a fishing town. He painted pictures of fish.

This painting shows fish on a table. There is a crab and some flat fish called soles. The fish look like they are still alive.

The painting is not easy to understand. Picasso used many shapes that you can see through. The paint is thin and the colors are cool. This makes the picture look calm, like a quiet world under the sea.

But something is wrong. The fish show their teeth. The crab has its claws open. It looks like they will fight. This feeling of danger makes the painting very powerful.","**Vervet Monkeys**

Cheney and Seyfarth watched a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the main male monkey saw a new male monkey in some trees nearby. The new monkey wanted to join the group. If he did, the main male would probably lose his important position. The main monkey had a clever idea to keep the stranger away. When the new monkey came down from the trees to cross the open ground, the main monkey made a special call. Vervet monkeys use this call when they see a leopard. The stranger quickly ran back to the safety of the trees. Every time the stranger tried to move closer, the main monkey made the call again. This worked well until the main monkey made a big mistake. After using the trick many times, he made the leopard call while he was walking calmly across the open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**

In a village in England, people collected the animals their 70 cats caught. In one year, the cats caught over 1,000 animals. An American professor saw these numbers. He calculated that all the cats in Britain must kill 100 million birds and small animals every year.

However, this is not a realistic way to think. You cannot just multiply the number from these village cats by all the cats in Britain. Most cats live in towns. They have smaller areas to hunt and catch fewer animals than the cats in this study. The important question is: can the bird population survive this? The answer seems to be yes.

In winter, many people give food to birds. Also, garden trees and buildings give birds safe places to nest. This means the number of birds is kept higher than it would be naturally. The study shows that cats are important hunters, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**

The buffaloes are very important to the people of the marsh, and they are cared for very well. Every morning, the buffaloes leave the place where they sleep, sometimes near a fire with their owners. They move very, very slowly and tiredly towards the faraway reeds across the water. They often make sad, groaning sounds. For a long time, they stand at the edge of the platform, groaning to each other about how tired they feel. Finally, the leader takes one heavy step forward and goes into the water.

Once they are in the water, they become very lazy again. It seems like they have forgotten what they planned to do. They stay in the water, making low complaining sounds for many minutes. Their movements away from the house are so slow you hardly notice them. In the end, they are swimming. They are so low in the water that it looks like they are using their last bit of energy to keep their noses above the water. Their rolling eyes make it seem like they are about to drown. So, they spend the day among the reeds, patient but complaining, mostly underwater, eating green shoots they find.

Picasso liked to paint the things he saw around him. In the spring of 1940, he was in a fishing town and painted several pictures of fish. This painting shows a fish seller's table with a crab and a pair of scales holding two or three flatfish. Even though they are caught, the sea creatures look very much alive.

The painting is not very easy to understand. Picasso painted it using flat, overlapping shapes that you can see through. The paint is thin and the colours are cool and quiet. This makes the painting look like a calm, slow-moving world under the water. But this calm feeling is broken by something else. It looks like the fish and the crab are about to fight. The fish show their teeth and the crab has its claws open. The shape of the weighing scales is also sharp and pointed. Even the chain around one of the fish looks a bit threatening. There is a feeling of danger and hidden violence that gives the picture a special, powerful meaning.",,"Cheney and Seyfarth recount an incident in which the dominant male of a group of vervet monkeys they were observing detected an unfamiliar male lingering in a nearby grove. The outsider’s motive was clear: he was assessing the group with the aim of joining it. Should he succeed, the resident male would almost certainly lose his privileged status. In what might be considered a moment of vervet ingenuity, the dominant male devised an effective strategy to deter the intruder. Each time the stranger descended from the trees and attempted to cross the open ground toward the group, the dominant male issued an alarm call used by vervets to signal a leopard’s presence. The intruder promptly retreated to the safety of the trees. This tactic was repeated throughout the day, until the dominant male committed a critical error: after several successful attempts, he gave the leopard alarm call while casually walking across open ground himself.

What Cats Catch

A recent study in the English village of Felmersham, comprising 173 households, recorded the prey brought home by domestic cats. Over the course of a year, the village’s seventy cats returned more than 1,000 prey items. An American professor extrapolated from these figures, estimating that Britain’s cat population must be responsible for the deaths of 100 million birds and small mammals annually.
However, the compelling nature of such large numbers appears to have clouded rational judgment. Simply multiplying the catch rate of these rural cats by the total number of cats across Britain is not a realistic approach. The majority of cats in Britain are urban, with smaller territories and lower hunting success rates than those in the study. The central question should have been whether such predation levels are sustainable. Evidence suggests that they are.
During winter, many households provide food for birds, while gardens and buildings offer nesting sites, maintaining bird populations well above natural levels. Although the study confirms that cats are significant predators, it does not indicate that they are causing severe harm to Britain’s bird populations.

Buffalo's Day

Buffaloes are, in effect, the lifeline of the marsh dwellers, and they are treated with corresponding care. Each morning, the buffaloes—having spent the night on their platform or often beside the fire with their owners—set off with extreme slowness and apparent weariness toward the distant reed beds beyond the open water. Their progress through the marsh is marked by frequent groans of despair. For a considerable time, they remain at the platform's edge, groaning to one another about the exhaustion the day will bring, until the lead buffalo finally takes a heavy step forward and sinks into the water.
Once in the water, a profound lethargy settles over the group, as though they have forgotten their purpose. They may linger for many minutes, emitting low sounds of discontent. Their eventual movement away from the house is so gradual as to be almost imperceptible, but eventually they are swimming, so low in the water that only their nostrils remain above the surface, as if by a final, fading effort. Their rolling eyes convey an impression of imminent drowning. Thus, patient yet protesting, and largely submerged, they pass the day among the reeds and bulrushes, grazing unhurriedly on whatever green shoots their ancient heads encounter at eye level.

PICASSO, Pablo

The Soles, 1940. Oil on canvas. Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.

Picasso frequently painted subjects from his immediate surroundings, and in early 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, he produced several still lifes featuring fish. The apparent subject of this painting is a fishmonger’s slab displaying a crab and a pair of scales holding two or three soles. Despite their situation, the sea creatures appear remarkably alive. Interpreting the painting is not straightforward, as Picasso has approached the composition as a flat pattern of overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. This treatment, along with the thinly applied, delicate brushwork and restrained colour palette, evokes an underwater world of tranquil, slow-moving harmony. Yet this calm is disrupted by what seems an imminent confrontation: the fish bare their teeth, while the crab extends its claws. These sharp, angular forms are echoed in the scales, and even the chain encircling one fish takes on a menacing quality. An undercurrent of threat and barely contained violence lends the picture a symbolic intensity.",
290,"TIM RICE

I was ushered into the young man's drawing room, an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class.
Here was the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across and the astonishing evidence that a teenager existed who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures and furniture.
His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to read history, and he had nine months to kill before going up, during which time he intended to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers.
My own ambitions were just as insane as his, I wanted to be a pop star, for all the healthy reasons women, money and fame. The difference between Andrew and myself was that my dreams were never life or death to me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become so had I failed.
Consequently, when Andrew suggested a completely new insane ambition for me, i.e. to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no qualms about giving it a go. This was partly because within ten minutes of our introduction, he was at the piano and had played me three tunes he had composed -- I could tell that he was good. Very good.
As he confidently continued to bash out selections from some of the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of many of the best show albums from my parents LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world.
I had little to impress him with in return, other than instant praise for his music and a bona fide, actually released, seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) with which an unknown pop group had dealt the final blow to their moribund career by recording three months previously. We parted, promising to meet again and to write something together. I was still more interested in the charts than in the West End theatre, but told myself on the bus back to my flat that I had just met somebody of rare ability and determination, and I would be mad to miss out on being a sidekick to a chap who was clearly going to take the musical theatre by storm, probably by next week.
And even if the two of us failed to challenge the top musical composers successfully, then we could try to knock the Beatles and Rolling Stones off their perches later, in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would clearly be in need of some new material.
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a solicitor, the brief certainty I had enjoyed of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded somewhat. I would of course continue to keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist, and would turn out a few more three-chord songs tailored not to expose the limitations of my voice, but it was still odds-on that eventually I would stagger through my exams and wind up a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five.
By then I would have surely grown out of pop music as my father had confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying - if he was right I only had a few more months of enjoying it.
But in the meantime I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go and see a musical with him, to write words that aped musical lyricists rather than pop stars. And Andrew was a fascinating individual who talked of Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team.
I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical that he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was beyond question and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room.
The idea was the life of Dr Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was a worthy one indeed, but not one that truly fired my imagination. The hero was too squeaky-clean, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the enterprise was unoriginal in both conception and execution, owing far too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver.
On the other hand, Andrew's conviction of his score's precocious brilliance was infectious and not totally unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, later to be my agent for over a quarter of a century, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint.
I set to work with enormous enthusiasm, in particular for those songs that were intended to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes and in many instances gave me the title as well, most of which had presumably been thought up by his ex-wordsmith school pal who had already had a go. I skipped a day at the solicitors office, faking illness, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I did not know it that day but I had changed careers.",C2,,,"I went into the young man's living room. It was a tidy and calm space. The other rooms in the house seemed messy and were used by family members who were less active. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like a big improvement.

He had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen. It was also the first stereo record player and radio I had ever seen. I was surprised that a teenager had spent his money on old wine glasses, paintings, and furniture.

His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a place to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford. He had nine months before he started, and in that time he wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.

My own dreams were just as crazy as his. I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were never very serious for me. It's easy to say that now. They might have become serious if I had failed.

So when Andrew suggested a new crazy idea for me—to become a famous lyric writer like Oscar Hammerstein—I was happy to try it. This was partly because, just ten minutes after we met, he played three songs he had written on the piano. I could tell he was good. Very good.

He confidently played more music from shows he had written for school. It reminded me of the best musical albums from my parents' record collection. He needed a new lyric writer to work with outside of school.

I didn't have much to impress him with. I just praised his music and showed him a real seven-inch single of a song I had written. An unknown pop group had recorded it three months before, and it ended their failing career. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than theatre, but on the bus home I thought I had met someone with special talent and strong will. I would be silly not to work with someone who was clearly going to be very successful in musical theatre very soon.

Even if we didn't succeed against the top musical writers, we could try to compete with famous pop bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just returned to music and would probably need new songs.

The next day, I was back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer. My strong feeling about a life in show business with Andrew had become weaker. I would still look at the ads in music papers for bands needing a singer, and I would write a few more simple songs that didn't show my weak singing voice. But it was still likely that I would pass my exams and become a lawyer by age twenty-five.

By then, I would have probably stopped liking pop music, as my father was sure would happen by the time I was twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it.

But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to see a musical with him and to write words for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was also a very interesting person. He talked about good restaurants and old buildings, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team.

I wasn't sure about the musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was clear, and he said he knew all the right people. Soon, I was back in his living room.

The musical was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a kind man from the nineteenth century who started orphanages. His story was good, but it didn't really excite me. The main character was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the idea was not very new. It was too much like Lionel Bart's successful show, Oliver.

But Andrew really believed in his music, and his confidence made me feel positive too. He wasn't completely wrong. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for many years, often said: if one hamburger restaurant is successful, there is space for another. We could be the second restaurant.

I started working with a lot of energy, especially on the funny songs. Andrew told me the story, played me the music, and often gave me the song titles too. Many of these titles had probably been thought of by his old school friend who had already tried writing the words. I missed a day at the lawyer's office, saying I was sick, to write my first lyrics for a play. I didn't know it then, but that day I had changed my job forever.","I was shown into the young man's living room. It was a calm, well-organized space, very different from the messy rooms where the rest of his family lived. Going from the kitchen to his room felt like moving from economy to business class on a plane.

He had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had come across, and proof that a teenager had spent his money on expensive wine glasses, pictures, and furniture.

His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford, and he had nine months to wait before starting. During that time, he planned to become England's version of the famous composer Richard Rodgers.

My own dreams were just as unrealistic as his. I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were never a matter of life or death for me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become that important if I had failed.

So when Andrew suggested a new crazy idea for me—to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein—I had no problem trying it. This was partly because, just ten minutes after we met, he was at the piano playing me three of his own tunes. I could tell he was good. Very good.

As he confidently played songs from the many shows he had written and produced at school, they reminded me of the best musical albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist to work with in the real world.

I didn't have much to impress him with in return, except for my immediate praise for his music and a real seven-inch single of a song I had written. An unknown pop group had recorded it three months earlier, which ended their failing career. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music charts than West End theatre, but on the bus home I told myself I had met someone with rare talent and determination. I would be stupid not to work with someone who was clearly going to be very successful in musical theatre, probably very soon.

Even if we didn't manage to compete with the top composers, we could always try to challenge the Beatles and the Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just returned to music and would probably need some new songs.

The next day, back at my desk in the law office where I was training to be a solicitor, my brief certainty about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a little. Of course, I would still check the small ads in Melody Maker for bands needing a singer, and I would write a few more simple songs that didn't show the limits of my voice. But it was still likely that I would just about pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five.

By then, I would have probably grown out of pop music, as my father had confidently predicted I would by twenty-one. This was worrying—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it.

But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and to write words like musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was a fascinating person who talked about good restaurants and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team.

I wasn't sure about the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was clear, and he said he knew all the right people. Soon, I was back in his living room.

The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, the 19th-century philanthropist who started the orphanages named after him. His story was good, but it didn't really excite me. The hero was too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the whole project was not very original. It was too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver.

On the other hand, Andrew's belief in his music was convincing and not completely wrong. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who later became my agent for over twenty-five years, often said: if there's a need for one hamburger restaurant on a street, there's room for two. We could be the second restaurant.

I started working with a lot of energy, especially on the songs that were meant to be funny. Andrew explained the story, played me the tunes, and often gave me the song titles, which his previous lyricist from school had probably thought of. I skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of lyrics for the theatre. I didn't know it then, but that day I had changed careers.",,
291,"I chose this place to live, believing I would find anonymity among those who did not care if the plaster and glass and paintwork of rented houses splintered and decayed, who were not reproached by gardens gone to seed and rotting sofas. In that hope, as in most things, I was proved wrong. People in the shops, who are living their real lives, even if you aren't, soon start to recognise you. Next door's lull-blown roses pouring over the fence are persistent reminders that the gardens were loved once.
Usually, I stay inside trying to forget that there is a summer going on out there, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying in the transparent space between the treetops and roofs. I have cut back rosemary and lemon balm to make a space for a chair and my arms and hands are tingling with stings and scratches. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or sprawling to survive.
'Been doing a spot of clearing, I see.'
It's my upstairs neighbour, Jaz, leaning out of the window, the author of several unpublished manuscripts I am sometimes called upon to dissemble about in my capacity as an English teacher. I have a copy of the latest in my possession now.
'How's the work going, Jaz?'
'For goodness sake. In no other profession is one called on to account for oneself a thousand times a day by every Tom, Dick or Harry.' Her voice tails off, then rallies. 'Tell you what, Ann, I've got something to drink in the fridge. I'll bring it down.'
I don't want Jaz in the garden, and I see now, dully, that it looks mangled and bereft. The only access to this garden is through my flat and Jaz is banging on my door. 'So, you're on holiday now, you jammy so-and-so.' She sprawls, in shorts and vest, on the chair while I drop a cushion onto what had once been a little lawn. 'Cheers,' she says in her delusion of youth, 'I should've gone into teaching - a writer doesn't have holidays. Still, you know what they say, those who can, do, those who can't, teach.'
And there are those who can neither write nor teach.
'So, what plans for the hols?'
All my postponed dread of the school year's ending engulfs me. Empty days. Hot pavements blobbed with melting chewing gum. The walk down to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench.
'Actually, I'm going down to Stonebridge tomorrow. I've been meaning to ask you if you'd feed the cats.' My heart starts racing as I speak.
'Of course I will,' Jaz says. 'If I'm around,' knowing, as I did, that she would be. 'So where will you stay? Some bijou B and B?'
'No. I'll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' It isn't true that I shall stay there, but then I spend my life dealing with fiction of one sort or another.
'Going back to your roots. So what do you think of it so far? My opus?'
My silence on the subject has forced Jaz to enquire about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which lies half-heartedly half-read on my desk.
I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing presents and mall-order goodies to other houses and delivering returned manuscripts in silly bags to hers. Something prompts me to speak honestly for once.
'Let me give you a little tip, dear,' I begin.
'What?' She is affronted.
'Try writing about nice people for a change, pretty people who at least aspire to being good: a touch less solipsism, a bit more fiction...'
'Teachers!' Jaz is a mutinous schoolgirl about to snatch back a poorly marked essay.
'I myself keep a journal, I have for years, in which I write down something good, however small or trivial, about each day.' My words sound as prissy as my old-fashioned print dress.
'Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.'
Oh, I've got a life. I've got my work, and I go out sometimes and fly home again, sitting on the tube with my nose in a book.
When at last we go inside, my calm kitchen gives a moment's reassurance, then out of the blue comes the image of my school geography teacher Miss Tarrantine, who must have been about the age I am now, closing an ancient reptilian eyelid in a monstrous wink as she tells us, 'I've had my moments.' We nearly died.",C2,,"I chose this place to live because I thought no one would know me. I thought people here would not care about old houses and messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to know your face.

The roses from next door come over the fence. They show that someone loved this garden before.

Most days, I stay inside and try to forget about summer. But tonight, I am watching the birds fly between the trees and houses. I cut some plants to make space for a chair. Now my arms have small cuts.

My neighbour, Jaz, looks out her window. She is a writer. I am an English teacher, so sometimes I read her stories.

""Hello,"" she says. ""You are cleaning the garden.""

""How is your writing?"" I ask.

""Oh, please,"" she says. ""Everyone always asks me that. Wait, I have a drink. I will bring it down.""

I do not want Jaz to come to the garden. It looks messy now. She comes through my flat and sits in the chair. I sit on the ground.

""You are on holiday now,"" she says. ""You are lucky. A writer does not have holidays. You know what they say: those who can, do; those who can't, teach.""

I think: and some people can neither write nor teach.

""What will you do on your holiday?"" she asks.

I feel sad. I think of empty days, hot streets, and going to the park alone.

""I am going to Stonebridge tomorrow,"" I say. My heart beats fast. ""Can you feed my cats?""

""Of course,"" Jaz says. ""If I am here."" We both know she will be. ""Where will you stay?""

""With my old friend Ruby,"" I say. This is not true, but I often deal with stories that are not true.

Jaz asks, ""What do you think of my new story?""

I have not read it yet. I say, ""I like the title.""

Then I decide to be honest. ""Can I give you some advice?"" I ask.

""What?"" She looks upset.

""Try writing about nice people for a change. People who want to be good. Write a little less about yourself.""

""Teachers!"" Jaz says, like an angry child.

""I write in a journal every day,"" I tell her. ""I write one good thing about each day.""

""Write a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann,"" she says.

But I have a life. I have my work. I go out and come home. I read books on the train.

Later, in my kitchen, I feel calm. Then I remember my old geography teacher. She once said, ""I've had my moments,"" and winked. We all laughed.","I chose this place to live because I thought no one would care about me. I believed people here wouldn't mind if the houses were old or if the gardens were messy. But I was wrong.

""Been doing some gardening, I see,"" says a voice.

It's my upstairs neighbour, Jaz, looking out of her window. She writes books that nobody has published. As an English teacher, I sometimes have to talk about her writing. I have her latest book with me now.

""How's your writing going, Jaz?""

""Oh, please,"" she says. ""No other job makes you explain what you're doing all the time."" She stops talking, then continues. ""You know, Ann, I have something to drink in my fridge. I'll bring it down.""

I don't really want Jaz in the garden, and now I see it looks messy. The only way into the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is already knocking on my door. ""So you're on holiday now, you lucky person,"" she says. She sits in the chair wearing shorts, while I put a cushion on what used to be grass. ""Cheers,"" she says, acting young. ""I should have become a teacher - writers don't get holidays. But you know what they say: those who can do things, do them; those who can't, teach.""

And there are people who can neither write nor teach.

""So, what are your holiday plans?""

I feel suddenly worried about the school holidays. Empty days. Hot streets with old chewing gum. Walking to the shops and back. Sitting alone in the park.

""Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow,"" I say. ""Could you feed my cats?"" My heart beats fast as I ask.

""Of course,"" Jaz says. ""If I'm here."" We both know she will be. ""Where will you stay? In a nice hotel?""

""No. I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've been friends since we were eight."" This isn't true, but I spend my life dealing with stories anyway.

""Going back to where you're from. So what do you think of my book?""

I haven't said anything about her book, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is sitting half-read on my desk.

I like the title and tell her. I understand how red vans could seem cruel - they bring packages to other houses but only bring returned books to her. For once, I decide to be honest.

""Let me give you some advice,"" I begin.

""What?"" She sounds upset.

""Try writing about nice people for a change, good-looking people who try to be good. Write less about yourself, more about other people...""

""Teachers!"" Jaz sounds like an angry school student.

""I keep a diary where I write one good thing about every day, even something small."" My words sound a bit formal.

""Keep a diary! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.""

Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and sometimes I go out and come home again, reading on the train.

When we finally go inside, my kitchen feels calm for a moment. Then I suddenly remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine. She was probably my age now. She once closed one eye in a funny way and told us, ""I've had my good times."" We almost laughed too much.","I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn't care if rented houses were falling apart, who weren't bothered by messy gardens and old furniture.

'No. I'm staying with my oldest friend Ruby at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight.' This isn't true, but then I spend my life dealing with different kinds of stories.

'Going back to where you're from. So what do you think of my book?'

My silence about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is sitting half-read on my desk, has made her ask.

I like the title and tell her so. I can understand how red vans could be cruel - always bringing packages to other houses but only returning her rejected manuscripts to her. Something makes me be honest for once.

'Let me give you some advice,' I begin.

The roses from next door spilling over the fence serve as constant reminders that these gardens were once cherished.

Generally, I remain indoors, attempting to ignore the summer unfolding outside, but this evening I am observing the swifts as they fly through the clear expanse between the treetops and rooftops. I have pruned back rosemary and lemon balm to create space for a chair, and my arms and hands are stinging from scratches and insect bites. It is a narrow London garden, where plants must grow tall or spread widely in order to survive.

It’s my upstairs neighbour, Jaz, leaning out of the window. She is the author of several unpublished manuscripts, which I am occasionally expected to discuss tactfully in my role as an English teacher. I currently have a copy of her latest work in my possession.

“How’s the writing going, Jaz?”

“For goodness sake. In no other profession is one expected to justify oneself countless times a day to every passerby.” Her voice fades briefly, then regains strength. “I’ll tell you what, Ann—I’ve got something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.”

I do not want Jaz in the garden, and I now see, with dull recognition, that it appears dishevelled and stripped bare. The only way into the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is already knocking at my door.

“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky thing.” She slouches in shorts and a vest on the chair, while I place a cushion on what was once a small patch of lawn. “Cheers,” she says, with her affectation of youth. “I should have gone into teaching—a writer doesn’t get holidays.

292,"Paul Simon

Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult, but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols, who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange, unsettling sound would somehow, irrevocably, be linked with their destinies.
For Paul Simon, as for other youngsters in the US, the chief opportunity for hearing this new and invigorating type of music that was sweeping the country was courtesy of Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was required listening for a whole generation of fledgling rock idols. Like the young John Lennon, 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, with his ear glued to Radio Luxembourg - the only European outlet for the new rock and roll - Paul Simon was fascinated by the sounds pouring from Freed's show, and prepared himself for the next big step for a rock and roll obsessed teenager, the switch from listening to others' music to making his own.

Snow

No path was visible, but I thought that I would be all right if I walked with due caution. The wind hammered down from the heights, knocking me over as I slid and slithered on the slippery ice. Suddenly the innocent-looking snow gave way beneath me. I dropped, startled, into a hole some four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the gap between two rocks, melting away to leave nothing but a thin crust through which I had plunged. I hauled myself out, shaken and unnerved, wondering what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat back against the top of a pine tree that protruded from the snow to take stock of the situation. In an hour I had covered about half a mile. It was perfectly clear that I would have to abandon my plan.

Qualitative Research

There are now numerous books which attempt to give guidance to researchers about qualitative research. While much has been written about the collection of data, the books are often silent about the processes and procedures associated with data analysis. Indeed, much mystery surrounds the way researchers analyse their data. Accordingly, we invited a range of social scientists who have engaged in qualitative projects to discuss the approaches that they used. The idea was to share insight and understanding of the process of qualitative data analysis rather than to produce a guidebook for the intending researcher. Such a task involves a process of demystification, of making implicit procedures more explicit. While this may sound straightforward, we have found it far from simple. We have therefore given our contributors the opportunity to present their work in a range of styles, which include autobiographical narratives and more impersonal forms.",C2,,"**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was music for young people. But it was also important for older people. It helped the next music stars. They loved the music and knew it was important for their lives.

Paul Simon was a young person in the US. He heard this new music on a radio show by Alan Freed. Many future music stars listened to this show. John Lennon in England also listened to the radio for this music. Paul Simon loved the songs from the radio. He wanted to stop listening to music and start making his own music.

**Snow**

I could not see a path. I thought I would be okay if I walked slowly. The wind was very strong. It pushed me over. The ground was icy and I fell. Then, the snow under my feet broke. I fell into a deep hole. The snow was like a thin roof over a space between two rocks. It broke when I stood on it. I climbed out. I felt scared. I thought, what if the hole was much deeper? I sat down next to a pine tree to think. In one hour, I walked only half a mile. I knew I had to stop my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books for people who do research. These books talk about how to get information. But they do not explain how to understand the information. How people understand their information is often not clear.

So, we asked some scientists to talk about how they understand information. We wanted to share ideas about this. We did not want to make a guidebook for new researchers. We wanted to make hard things easier to understand. This sounds easy, but it is not. So, we let the writers write in different ways. Some wrote about their own lives. Some wrote in a simple way.","**Paul Simon**

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mostly for young people. But it was also very important because it changed the lives of many older people. It also helped create the next famous rock stars. These new stars listened to the music and felt that this new and exciting sound was going to be a big part of their future.

For Paul Simon, like for other young Americans, the best way to hear this new music was on Alan Freed's radio show, *Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party*. All the new rock stars listened to this show. Paul Simon loved the music from the show. Just like John Lennon in Liverpool, who listened to Radio Luxembourg for rock and roll, Paul Simon was fascinated. He was ready for the next step: to stop just listening to music and to start making his own.

**Snow**

I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was very careful. The wind was very strong and pushed me over as I walked on the slippery ice. Suddenly, the snow under my feet broke. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a space between two rocks, and it was not strong enough to hold me. I climbed out, feeling scared. I thought about what would have happened if the hole was thirty feet deep. I sat down next to a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. I understood that I had to give up my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

Today, there are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. A lot has been written about how to collect information, but the books often do not explain how to study that information. In fact, how researchers study their information is often not clear. Because of this, we asked different social scientists to talk about the ways they study information in their projects. We wanted them to share their ideas about the process, not to write a guidebook for new researchers. This means we wanted to make the unclear parts clearer and easier to understand. This sounds simple, but we found it was not easy. So, we let the writers present their work in different ways, like telling their own stories or writing in a more formal style.","Paul Simon

In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular with young people, but its real importance was the strong effect it had on older and middle-class adults. It also prepared the way for the next generation of rock stars, who listened with amazement. They felt sure that this unusual and exciting music would be connected to their futures in some permanent way.

For Paul Simon, like many other young Americans, the main way to hear this new and exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio program, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for an entire generation of future rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was listening to Radio Luxembourg far away in Liverpool, Paul Simon was completely fascinated by the music he heard on Freed's show. He was getting ready for the natural next step for a teenager who loved rock and roll: to stop just listening to music and to start making his own.

Snow

I couldn't see a path, but I believed I would be fine if I was very careful. The wind blew strongly from the mountains, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow, which looked safe, collapsed under me. I fell, surprised, into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had created a cover over a space between two rocks, but it had melted, leaving only a weak surface that I fell through. I pulled myself out, feeling shocked and worried. I thought about what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat down, leaning against the top of a pine tree that stuck out of the snow, to think about my situation. In one hour, I had only travelled about half a mile. It was very clear that I had to give up my plan.

Qualitative Research

Today, there are many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect information, these books often do not explain how to analyse it. In fact, the way researchers analyse their data often seems unclear. Because of this, we asked a number of social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about the methods they used. Our goal was to share knowledge and understanding about the process of analysing qualitative data, not to create a instruction manual for new researchers. This job involves making these unclear processes easier to understand and explaining methods that are not usually discussed. Although this sounds simple, we discovered it is actually quite complicated. For this reason, we let our contributors present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing.","**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a youth movement, but its lasting significance came from the powerful effect it had on the middle class and older generations. It also prepared the way for the next wave of rock stars, who listened with amazement and understood that this unusual, disruptive sound would be permanently connected to their futures.

For Paul Simon, as for many young people across the United States, the main way to hear this exciting new music that was spreading nationwide was through Alan Freed's radio program, *Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party*. Freed's show was essential listening for a whole generation of future rock idols. Just like the young John Lennon far away in Liverpool, who listened closely to Radio Luxembourg—the only station in Europe playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music coming from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next logical step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to other people's music to creating his own.

**Snow**

There was no clear path, but I believed I would be fine if I walked carefully. A strong wind blew down from the mountains, knocking me over as I slipped on the icy surface. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe collapsed under me. Surprised, I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a cover over a space between two rocks, but it had melted, leaving only a weak layer that broke when I stepped on it. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and anxious, and thought about what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I rested against the top of a pine tree sticking out of the snow to consider my situation. In one hour, I had only travelled about half a mile. It was completely obvious that I needed to give up my plan.

**Qualitative Research**

There are now many books that try to help researchers with qualitative research. Although a lot has been written about gathering data, these books often do not explain the methods and steps related to analysing that data. In fact, how researchers analyse their data is often not well understood. Because of this, we asked several social scientists who have done qualitative projects to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share knowledge about the process of qualitative data analysis, not to create a handbook for new researchers. This kind of task involves making things clearer and explaining processes that are usually not stated directly. While this might sound simple, we found it to be quite difficult. We have therefore allowed our contributors to present their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal styles.",
293,"Self-help books

Dione Reverend was a mere editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr John Gray. 'I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,' she says, chuckling, and she was right. The desperately understanding Dr Gray is now a multimillionaire and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr Gray's slim volume on how to bridge communication gaps between the sexes is the unofficial mascot of a huge and expanding self-help industry that may, as its insiders claim, answer some of American's myriad yearnings for betterment. It also feeds off those yearnings, creates hundreds more and - not incidentally - props up the entire world of New York publishing.
As Britain is learning, the genre can fill entire polls with tomes os quackish and histrionic as their covers - but there are worse. For every self-help title published, thousands are rejected as too derivative or specialised. This is no small mercy. As a new breed of heavyweight editor-cum-ogent goes looking for the next lightweight blockbuster, prose style is the lost thing on anybody's mind. Marketability is everything. 'How promotable is the author? What's the ""hook'? Is it universal enough?' Ms Reverend rattles off the key questions, then admits: 'If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.'

Autobiographies

There has to be a tacit understanding, a pact, between an autobiographer and reader that the truth is being told. Such at pact is, I would guess, rarely observed to the full. There are many reasons why the writer should lapse. There may be actions or thoughts which he feels it is simply too shameful to make public. There may be things he decides against putting down on paper because (as he rationalises) they are not important enough. There are also more complex and interesting reasons for surreptitiously breaking the pact. The autobiographer may decide that the ultimate goal of the work, the truth about himself, can be served by inventing stories that encapsulate the truth more neatly, more pointedly than strict adherence to the facts ever could. Or he may break the pact by deciding, from the beginning, never to adhere to it. He may call his book an autobiography simply in order to create a positive balance of credulity in the reader's mind that will be extremely convenient for him in his storytelling, and which, in the case of his more naive readers, may not be exhausted even by the time the story ends, so that these readers will go away thinking they have read a true history, when they have read nothing but a fiction. All of which can be done in no particular spirit of cynicism.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories

Students of the detective story have explained the flourishing of this genre as an expression of the conflicts of late nineteenth and early twentieth century society. The detective story is essentially an allegory. The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society, its lawless impulses quelled so that society can again function smoothly. In Hammett's peculiar version, society is returned to its former state, but that itself is shown to be corrupt and false.
The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's tales are two aspects of the same personality. The private eye and his prey understand each other and are, in a strange way, comfortable with each other. The private eye has a foot in each camp. From the point of view of the criminal he is a bit too straight, and from that of the law a bit too seedy. He is at once a crook and a competitor. The mission of the private eye is sometimes tempered by his sense of complicity, and sometimes his punitive zeal is intensified by his anxiety about this ambiguity.

SCIENCE WRITING

Today's greatest scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss that art and hear his advice, I met him in an unfamiliar milieu: at the Grand Hotel (where he was staying while promoting his new book). Neither of us, it has to be said, felt much at home. As for writing a piece set in surroundings of such lifeless self-aggrandisement, Gould said: 'I couldn't do it: Trollope might but he knew the culture. And knowing the culture is central to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is a civilisation of its own. As a result, only scientists can make a good job of presenting it. If you don't live in the community and don't understand its rules, you are crippled from the start.'
One of Gould's axioms is: never write down to the reader. 'Make no concessions,' he says. 'You can simplify the language but must never adulterate it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers notice that they are being patronised, your piece is dead.'",C2,,,,"**Self-help Books**

Diane Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first read a book by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I saw the title and immediately knew it would be a huge bestseller,"" she says, laughing. She was correct. Dr. Gray is now extremely wealthy, and Diane Reverend runs her own company. His short book about communication between men and women represents the large and growing self-help industry. Supporters say this industry meets people's strong desire to improve their lives. However, it also uses this desire to create more needs and, importantly, supports the New York publishing world.

As people in Britain are discovering, this type of book can fill shelves with titles that are as silly and dramatic as their covers. But some are worse. For every self-help book that gets published, thousands are turned down for being too unoriginal or specific. This is actually a good thing. As a new type of powerful editor looks for the next popular book, no one is thinking about the quality of the writing. The only thing that matters is whether it will sell. ""Can the author promote the book well? What is the interesting idea? Will it appeal to many people?"" Ms. Reverend quickly lists the important questions. She then admits, ""If someone brings me a really good title, that's most of the work done. You know you can attract readers.""

**Autobiographies**

There is a silent agreement between a person writing their life story and the reader that the story is true. I believe this agreement is rarely followed completely. There are many reasons why the writer might not tell the full truth. They might feel some actions or thoughts are too embarrassing to share. They might leave things out because they think (or tell themselves) they are not important enough. There are also more complex and interesting reasons for secretly breaking the promise. The writer might think that by inventing stories, they can show the truth about themselves more clearly and effectively than by just sticking to the facts. Or, they might decide from the start not to tell the truth at all. They might call their book an autobiography just to make the reader believe it is true. This makes it easier for them to tell their story. Some readers, especially the more trusting ones, might finish the book still believing it is a true story, when in fact they have read a work of fiction. The writer may not even be doing this in a cruel or dishonest way.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

People who study detective stories say the genre became popular because it showed the problems in society from the late 19th to early 20th century. The detective story is like a symbolic tale. The crime represents a basic human feeling, like desire or greed. Solving the crime, at least in traditional stories, means the person and society are back in harmony. The dangerous impulses are controlled so society can work well again. However, in Hammett's special version, society does return to how it was before, but that society is shown to be dishonest and corrupt.

In Hammett's stories, the person chasing and the person being chased are two parts of the same character. The private detective and the criminal he is after understand each other and are, in a strange way, at ease with one another. The detective belongs to both sides. From the criminal's point of view, he is a little too honest, and from the law's point of view, he is a little too rough. He is both a criminal and a rival. Sometimes, the detective's task is softened because he feels connected to the criminal. Other times, his desire to punish is stronger because he is worried about his own unclear role.

**Science Writing**

The best science writer today is Stephen Jay Gould. To talk about this skill and get his advice, I met him in a place that was unusual for both of us: a grand hotel where he was staying to promote his new book. Neither of us felt very comfortable there. When I asked about writing in such a place, which seemed designed to impress but had no real life, Gould said, ""I couldn't do it. A writer from the past, like Trollope, might have, but he understood that world. Understanding the culture is essential for a writer to be successful. Science, for instance, is its own world. Because of this, only scientists can present it well. If you aren't part of that community and don't know its rules, you are at a big disadvantage from the beginning.""

One of Gould's main rules is: never treat your reader as less intelligent. ""Don't make things too easy for them,"" he says. ""You can use simpler language, but you must never make the ideas less complex. Most importantly, you cannot simplify the argument. The moment readers feel you are talking down to them, your writing has failed.""","**Self-Help Books**

Diane Reverend was working as an editor at Random House in New York when she first encountered a manuscript by the then-unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I only had to see the title to know it would become a number one bestseller,"" she remarks with a laugh, and her prediction proved accurate. Dr. Gray, who offers ample understanding, is now a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend runs her own company. Dr. Gray's concise guide to overcoming communication barriers between the genders has become the unofficial symbol of a vast and growing self-help industry. Proponents argue that this industry addresses many Americans' profound desires for self-improvement. However, it also capitalises on these aspirations, generates countless new ones, and, not insignificantly, provides substantial support for the New York publishing world.

As Britain is discovering, this genre can populate entire shelves with volumes as dubious and melodramatic as their covers suggest—though some are even worse. For every self-help book that is published, thousands are turned down for being too unoriginal or niche. This is a fortunate circumstance. As a new type of powerful editor-agent seeks the next commercially successful lightweight hit, literary style is the last consideration. Market appeal is paramount. ""How promotable is the author? What is the unique angle? Does it have broad enough appeal?"" Ms. Reverend quickly lists the essential questions, then concedes, ""If someone approaches me with a truly memorable title, that's most of the battle won. You know you can capture the public's attention.""

**Autobiographies**

An unspoken agreement, a pact, must exist between an autobiographer and the reader, assuring that the truth is being recounted. I suspect this pact is seldom honoured in its entirety. There are numerous reasons why a writer might deviate from the truth. They may have done things or harboured thoughts they consider too shameful to reveal publicly. They might also consciously omit details, justifying that they are insignificant. More complex and intriguing reasons for covertly breaking the pact also exist. An autobiographer could conclude that the ultimate objective of the work—conveying the truth about themselves—is better achieved by fabricating stories that encapsulate that truth more neatly and pointedly than a strict adherence to the facts would allow. Alternatively, the writer may choose from the outset not to honour the pact at all. They might label their book an autobiography merely to foster a predisposition to believe in the reader's mind. This is extremely useful for their narrative and, for more credulous readers, this willingness to believe may persist until the very end. Consequently, these readers will finish the book under the impression they have read a true account, when in fact they have consumed a work of fiction. All of this can be done without any particular cynical intent.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Literary critics who study the detective story have interpreted the genre's popularity as a reflection of the social conflicts prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Fundamentally, the detective story functions as an allegory. The crime symbolically represents a fundamental human impulse, such as lust or greed. Its resolution, at least in the conventional narrative, signifies the reintegration of the individual into society, with their lawless urges suppressed so that society can function smoothly again. In Hammett's distinctive treatment, society is indeed restored to its previous state, but that very state is revealed to be corrupt and deceptive.

In Hammett's stories, the hunter and the hunted represent two facets of the same personality. The private investigator and his quarry comprehend one another and are, oddly, at ease with each other. The private eye straddles both worlds. From the criminal's perspective, he is somewhat too honest, and from the law's viewpoint, he is somewhat too disreputable. He is simultaneously an outlaw and a rival. The private eye's mission is sometimes moderated by his feeling of involvement in the criminal world, while at other times, his desire to punish is heightened by his unease about this very ambiguity.

**Science Writing**

The foremost scientific essayist of our time is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss this craft and hear his advice, I met him in an unfamiliar setting: the Grand Hotel, where he was staying during the promotion of his latest book. It must be said that neither of us felt entirely comfortable there. When I suggested writing about such sterile and ostentatious surroundings, Gould stated, ""I couldn't do it. Trollope might have, but he understood that society. And understanding the culture is fundamental to being a successful writer. Science, for instance, is a distinct civilisation. Consequently, only scientists can effectively communicate it to others. If you are not part of that community and are unaware of its conventions, you are at a significant disadvantage from the beginning.""

One of Gould's fundamental principles is to never condescend to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he insists. ""You can simplify the language, but you must never dilute its substance. Most importantly, you cannot simplify the underlying concepts. The moment readers perceive that they are being patronised, your work has failed.""",
294,"Advertising on trial

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic, hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years.
In Britain, it meant in 1991 alone that while gross domestic product (GDP) declined, interest rates remained punitively high, consumer spending on almost everything other than staples fell, more than half a million people lost their jobs, and some 75,000 homes were repossessed.
Every single business in the country was affected, some - the vehicle and building trades - finding themselves 30 per cent down. A lot of people - a lot of companies - in a lot of countries suffered. Of course, advertising people are scarcely unique in losing their jobs in such difficult times, but of all those still in employment, they often feel particularly under pressure.
Seen, as they are, to spearhead efforts to support the bottom line, they suppose themselves to be under close enough scrutiny from their colleagues, let alone their bosses. Moreover, they are also faced with the very considerable problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets. They have been told that less must be more.
And yet, alongside these psychological and financial imperatives lies an almost paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The notion that companies should be making sure they are producing services and goods that their customers want, as opposed to merely what it is convenient for them to provide, is not a new one. Still, it's scarcely unfair to say that it has been only over the past ten or fifteen years that many companies seem to have put the idea intentionally, rather than fortuitously, into practice.
The consequences have been that marketing activities have at last begun to be given the attention they deserve by management, that these people have acquired a little learning about the subject, and that a few brands have actually begun to be genuinely marketed.
All these things have pleasingly increased the status of marketing people, while simultaneously adding to their burden. Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there's some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people. It is certainly true that if the 80s was the decade in which advertising never had it so good, the start of the 90s saw the industry enduring its worst downturn for a generation. This was, of course, partly a direct consequence of the economic climate at the time.
However, there was also evidence of more deep-seated change which would not simply be waved away as, and when, economic prospects brightened. The fact was that while this recession naturally caused potential clients to review, reconsider and often cut their budgets at the time, it also made them examine more closely than ever before the economics of advertising.
And, generally, in the absence of concrete, convincing and quantitative evidence to the contrary, they had to conclude that the benefits of advertising might be questionable. At a time when enthusiasm to account for every dollar spent was naturally high, it was simply not clear enough to many client companies exactly what they were getting for the large sums of money they were spending, exactly what return they were seeing on their investment. Advertising - ever a business to excite the suspicions of the sceptic - was, as a consequence, more than ever before on trial.
Thus, client companies almost everywhere took the view of one of their leaders quoted in the British trade magazine Campaign: 'We want better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, better media placement, better thinking. We aim to ensure we get advertising agencies' best people on our business and then ensure they are motivated to work their fingers to the bone, producing outstanding work for us.'
Now, while none of this should elicit sympathy for a thoroughly tough business, it does mean that many of those advertising people still in work continue to face precisely the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less. If this is, in itself, sufficiently trying, a number of other factors have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult.
Some of these are a direct consequence of the recession discussed earlier: the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take the sort of risks that are ironically often the essence of good advertising. Other events would have happened irrespective of local or global economic conditions.
These include, for example, the dramatic demographic changes facing much of the West, the burgeoning power of the retailer, the changing needs and desires of consumers, the rise of sponsorship, the increasingly onerous legal restrictions on advertising. And, of course, for some companies there is the new challenge of advertising abroad. Together with the economic situation, it is these matters which have forced many of those responsible for advertising to revisit Lord Leverhulme's commonplace that: 'Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half.' Because now more than ever before, the pressure is on to increase the proportion of advertising that works.
It is not terribly surprising that, at the moment, help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available. Generally, companies and the advertising agencies they use have been far too busy simply coping with these circumstances to wish to talk or write about them, while those that have succeeded in keeping their heads above water are often understandably anxious to keep the secrets of their success to themselves.
This means that while conferences and seminars may provide some useful information, the books currently available on advertising, and how to do it, really don't. Those that are available tend to treat the process of producing advertising with too much respect. To give the impression that the work advertising agencies produce is invariably of the highest quality, deeply considered and remarkable value for money, is neither true nor likely to help those employees of the client company who are ultimately responsible.",C2,,,"Advertising on trial

If you worked in advertising in the early 1990s, it was probably the hardest time of your career. The economic downturn was very bad. It was longer and more serious than anyone expected, even the people who thought things would be bad. It affected rich countries as badly as any time in thirty years.

In Britain, in 1991, the country's total output went down. However, the cost of borrowing money stayed very high. People spent less on almost everything except basic food. Over half a million people lost their jobs, and banks took back about 75,000 homes.

Every business in the country was affected. Some, like car and building companies, lost 30% of their business. Many people and companies in many countries suffered. Of course, advertising workers were not the only ones who lost their jobs. But those who kept their jobs often felt a lot of pressure.

They are seen as the people who help companies make money, so they feel their colleagues and bosses are watching them closely. They also have a big problem: they are asked to do a harder job with less money. They have been told to do more with less.

At the same time, people now think the marketing process is more important. The idea that companies should make what customers want, not just what is easy for them to make, is not new. But it is fair to say that only in the last ten to fifteen years have many companies really started to do this on purpose.

Because of this, company managers have started to pay more attention to marketing. They have learned a little about it, and a few products have started to be marketed properly.

These changes have made marketing workers more important, but it has also given them more work. People are starting to see marketing as a cure for everything, which it is not. About half of most marketing money is spent on advertising, so the advertising people are often the ones who are responsible. It is true that the 1980s were a very good time for advertising, but the start of the 1990s was the worst time for the industry in many years. This was partly because of the bad economy.

However, there were also deeper changes that would not disappear when the economy got better. The recession made companies look at their budgets and often cut them. It also made them study the value of advertising much more carefully.

Without clear facts and numbers to show that advertising worked, many companies had to think that the benefits might not be good enough. At a time when everyone was watching every dollar they spent, many companies did not know what they were getting for their large advertising payments. They did not know what return they were getting on their money. Advertising has always made some people suspicious, and now, more than ever, it was on trial.

So, companies everywhere agreed with a leader who spoke to a British trade magazine: 'We want better plans, better focus on the right people, better creative ideas, better use of media, and better thinking. We want the advertising agency's best people to work very hard for us and produce excellent work.'

This does not mean we should feel sorry for the tough advertising business. But it does mean that many advertising workers still face the same problem as their clients: how to do more with less. This is difficult enough, but other things have also made it hard to create good advertising.

Some of these problems are a direct result of the recession: arguments about production costs and not wanting to take risks. Ironically, taking risks is often what makes good advertising. Other changes would have happened even if the economy was good.

These changes include the big shifts in population in Western countries, the growing power of shops, changes in what customers want and need, the rise of sponsorship, and more difficult laws about advertising. For some companies, there is also the new job of advertising in other countries. The economy and all these other things have made advertising people think again about a famous saying: 'Only half my advertising works. The problem is, I don't know which half.' Now, more than ever, there is pressure to make a bigger part of advertising work well.

It is not surprising that there is not much help available for people who want to do this. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with the situation to talk or write about it. Those who have managed to survive often want to keep their success secrets to themselves.

This means that while meetings and talks can give some useful information, the books about advertising that are available now do not really help. The books that exist often talk about making advertising with too much respect. They give the idea that the work from advertising agencies is always the best quality, very well thought-out, and great value for money. This is not true, and it does not help the company workers who are finally responsible for the advertising.","Advertising on Trial

If you worked in advertising in the early 1990s, it was probably the most difficult time of your career. The economic downturn was very serious. It was longer and worse than anyone expected, affecting developed countries as badly as any recession in thirty years.

In Britain, in 1991 alone, the country's total economic output went down. However, interest rates stayed very high. People spent less on almost everything except basic necessities. Over half a million people lost their jobs, and banks took back around 75,000 homes.

Every business in the country was affected. Some, like car sales and construction, saw their business fall by 30 percent. Many people and companies in many countries suffered. Of course, advertising professionals were not the only ones who lost their jobs in such hard times. But for those who kept their jobs, they often felt a lot of pressure.

They are seen as the people who help companies make a profit, so they feel that their colleagues and bosses are watching them very closely. On top of that, they face a major problem: they are being asked to do their difficult jobs with much smaller budgets. They have been told they must achieve more with less money.

At the same time, there is a strange contradiction. The importance of marketing has grown. The idea that companies should make products and services that customers actually want, rather than just what is easy for the company to make, is not new. However, it is fair to say that only in the last ten to fifteen years have many companies really started to follow this idea on purpose.

As a result, company leaders have finally started to pay proper attention to marketing. They have learned a little about it, and a few brands have actually started to be marketed well.

All of this has improved the status of marketing staff, but it has also increased their responsibilities. Marketing is now often seen as a solution for everything, which it is not. Since about half of most marketing budgets is spent on advertising, the advertising people are often the ones who are held responsible. It is certainly true that if the 1980s were a very good decade for advertising, the start of the 1990s was the worst downturn the industry had seen in a generation. This was partly a direct result of the poor economy.

However, there were also signs of deeper changes that would not just disappear when the economy improved. The recession made potential clients review and often cut their budgets. It also made them look more closely than ever at whether advertising was worth the money.

Generally, without clear, convincing, and measurable evidence that it worked, they had to conclude that the benefits of advertising were not certain. At a time when companies were carefully watching every dollar they spent, it was not clear to many what they were getting for their large investments. Advertising, which has always been viewed with suspicion by some, was now, more than ever, on trial.

Because of this, client companies everywhere agreed with a statement made by a business leader in the British magazine Campaign: 'We want better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, better media placement, and better thinking. We want the best people from the advertising agencies working on our business, and we want them to be motivated to work extremely hard to produce excellent work for us.'

While this does not mean we should feel sorry for the tough advertising business, it does mean that many advertising professionals still face the same problem as their clients: how to do more with less. If this is not difficult enough, several other factors have made creating effective advertising especially hard.

Some of these are a direct result of the recession: arguments over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, even though risk is often essential for good advertising. Other changes would have happened no matter what the economy was doing.

These include major changes in the population in Western countries, the growing power of retailers, changes in what consumers want, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter laws controlling advertising. For some companies, there is also the new challenge of advertising in other countries. Together with the economic situation, these issues have forced those in charge of advertising to think again about a famous saying: 'Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half.' Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the amount of advertising that works.

It is not very surprising that help for those who want to do this is hard to find. Generally, companies and their advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these problems to talk or write about them. Those who have managed to survive are understandably keen to keep their success secrets to themselves.

This means that while conferences and seminars can provide some useful information, the books currently available on advertising and how to do it are not very helpful. The books that exist often treat the process of creating advertising with too much respect. To suggest that the work from advertising agencies is always of the highest quality, very well thought-out, and excellent value for money is not true. It is also not helpful for the client company employees who are finally responsible for the results.","Advertising Under Scrutiny

For those working in advertising, the early 1990s were likely the most difficult period of their careers. The economic recession was longer, deeper, and more severe than even the most negative forecasts had predicted, affecting industrialised nations as badly as at any time in thirty years.

In Britain in 1991, the situation was clear: the economy shrank, interest rates stayed very high, spending on non-essential goods fell, over half a million people became unemployed, and around 75,000 homes were repossessed.

Almost every industry was affected, with sectors like car manufacturing and construction seeing activity drop by as much as thirty percent. While advertising professionals were not the only ones to lose their jobs in such hard times, those who remained employed often felt especially under pressure.

Because they are seen as leading the effort to maintain profits, they feel closely watched by colleagues and managers. At the same time, they face the major challenge of having to do their increasingly difficult jobs with ever-smaller budgets. They are expected to achieve more with less.

At the same time, there was a growing—and somewhat contradictory—belief in the importance of marketing. The idea that companies should produce what customers actually want, rather than what is simply convenient for them to make, is not new. Still, it is fair to say that only in the previous ten to fifteen years had many firms really started to apply this idea deliberately, not just by chance.

As a result, company leaders finally began paying proper attention to marketing, learned a little about it, and some brands started to be marketed in a genuine way. These changes raised the status of marketing staff, but also increased their workload. Marketing began to be seen, incorrectly, as a solution to every problem.

With advertising usually making up about half of the marketing budget, it is fair to say that a lot of the responsibility falls on advertising agencies. If the 1980s were a very successful decade for advertising, the start of the 1990s saw the industry experience its worst decline in a generation. This was partly a direct result of the poor economy.

However, there were signs of deeper changes that would not disappear when the economy improved. The recession not only made clients cut their budgets, but also made them look more carefully than ever at whether advertising was worth the money.

Generally, without strong, measurable evidence showing that advertising worked, they had to conclude its benefits were uncertain. At a time when companies were keen to justify every dollar spent, many were unsure what exactly they were getting for their large advertising investments. As a result, advertising—always viewed with some doubt—was under more pressure than ever before.

This view was summed up by a company leader quoted in the trade magazine Campaign: “We want better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, better media planning, and better thinking. We expect advertising agencies to give us their best people and make sure they work extremely hard to produce excellent work for us.”

While this may not make people feel sorry for a tough industry, it means many advertising professionals still face the same problem as their clients: how to achieve more with less. Besides this basic challenge, several other factors have made creating effective advertising especially difficult.

Some of these are a direct result of the recession: arguments over production costs, and a reluctance to take the kinds of creative risks that are often essential for good advertising. Other changes would have happened no matter the economic situation.

These include major demographic shifts in Western countries, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer tastes, the rise of sponsorship, and tighter laws controlling advertising. For some companies, advertising in other countries has also become a new challenge.

Together with the economic situation, these issues have made those in advertising think again about the old saying: “Half of my advertising is effective; I just don’t know which half.” Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the amount of advertising that works.

It is not surprising that useful advice on how to do this is hard to find. Most companies and their advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to talk or write about them. Those that have managed to succeed are often unwilling to share how they did it.

This means that while conferences and seminars might offer some helpful ideas, the books currently available about advertising generally do not. Most existing books treat the process with too much respect. To suggest that advertising agencies always produce high-quality, well-thought-out work that offers good value is not true, and it does not help the clients who are ultimately responsible for the results.",
295,"POETRY RECITALS

At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it, and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. It is fairly safe to say that, at the present time, there is an especially bewildering complexity of poetic tendencies, of kinds of poetry being written, of warring factions, of ways of presenting, criticising and teaching poetry, and of conflicting beliefs about the role of the poet in society. 
Very broadly speaking, the present debate in contemporary poetry concerns the reciprocal mistrust and disapproval shown by the seriously committed 'literary' writers, whose poems are intended to be printed and read on the page, and the 'popular', performing poets who, while they will probably publish their verses in magazines and collections, are happier declaiming them to an audience. Of course, this division is far from absolute.
The practice of promoting public poetry readings has been steadily increasing over the past twenty years or so, in many different forms. Small literary societies in provincial towns conduct them in village halls or the sitting rooms of their members; schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to audiences of students; arts festivals often advertise poetry readings by well-known authors on their programmes. The consequences of all these events, and of poets being more or less obliged to become public performers, are manifold and of uncertain benefit to them as mists.
For the 'pop' poets, whose work has been composed expressly for the purpose of recital to live audiences, the issue is plain. They can only profit from public performance. Their verses are often very simple in both form and content, and can be assimilated at a single hearing; it is on the printed page that the deficiencies of thought, technique and imagination become clear. Poets who are dedicated to their craft, and are doing their best to continue and develop what is finest in the traditions of poetry - which involves compressing the maximum amount of passion, thought, wit and vision into the smallest possible space and achieving rhythmic effects of great variety and subtlety -- are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience which is probably encountering their work for the first time. The danger here is, not that they will be tempted to emulate the content and style of the entertainers, but that they might, in the effort to achieve instant communication, read only their most readily accessible work which is quite likely to be their slightest and least characteristic. 
Attendance at poetry reading cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page, though it can be an enjoyable and instructive adjunct. To hear good poets read their work aloud, even if they are not accomplished public speakers, is a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken. The principal justification for popular recitals of poetry, where the readings are sometimes interspersed with musical items (jazz and poetry used to be a very popular mixture), is that audiences will come to associate poetry with pleasure and not feel that it is an art available only to an initiated minority. 
",C2,,"**POETRY READINGS**

At any time, the world of poetry can seem confusing to people living then. Only later do people see which poets and poems are important.

Today, there are many different kinds of poetry. People also have different ideas about how to write, share, and teach it. One big difference is between two types of poets.

The first type are 'literary' poets. They write poems to be read in books. The second type are 'popular' poets. They also publish their poems, but they prefer to read them aloud to an audience. This difference is not always clear.

In the last twenty years, poetry readings have become much more common. They happen in many places. Small groups have them in village halls or people's homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to talk to students. Arts festivals often have famous poets reading their work.

For 'popular' poets, this is a good thing. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand when you hear them. They are written to be performed.

For serious 'literary' poets, it is more difficult. Their poems are often complex. They use few words to express big ideas and feelings. An audience hearing the poem for the first time may not understand it. The poet might feel they should only read their simplest poems, which are not always their best work.

Listening to a poetry reading is not the same as reading a poem yourself. But it can be a helpful and fun extra activity. Hearing the poet read can show you how the poem should sound. It is best if the audience can read the poem at the same time or already know it.

The main good thing about popular poetry readings is that they show people that poetry can be enjoyable. It is not just for a small group of experts.","POETRY READINGS

When you live in a certain time, it is hard to understand the literature of that time. Only later do people see clearly which writers and works are important. Today, there are many different kinds of poetry and many different opinions about it. People also disagree about how poetry should be presented and what a poet's job should be.

In simple terms, there are two main groups of poets today. The first group are serious writers. They write poems to be read in books. The second group are popular poets. They also publish their poems, but they prefer to perform them for an audience. Of course, not every poet fits perfectly into one of these groups.

In the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become much more common. Small book groups hold them in village halls or in people's homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals often include poetry readings by famous writers. Because of this, many poets now have to perform in public. The results of this are mixed and it is not always good for the poets.

For popular poets, who write poems to be performed, public readings are very helpful. Their poems are often simple in form and meaning, so people can understand them easily when they hear them. However, if you read these poems in a book, you might notice that the ideas or writing are not very deep.

For serious poets, the situation is different. They work hard to put deep feelings, clever thoughts, and beautiful rhythms into their poems. An audience hearing their work for the first time may not understand or like it. The risk for these poets is not that they will copy the popular poets, but that they might only perform their simplest poems to get a quick reaction from the audience. These simple poems are often not their best work.

Going to a poetry reading is not a replacement for reading poetry from a book. But it can be a fun and useful extra activity. Hearing a poet read their work can help you understand where to put the emphasis in the poem. It is best if the audience can read the poems at the same time or already know them.

The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to show people that poetry can be enjoyable. It helps them see that poetry is not just for a small, special group of people, but is an art for everyone.","POETRY RECITALS

When you live through a certain time in history, the literary world often seems unclear. It is only later that people can look back and see clear patterns and important writers. Today, the world of poetry is especially confusing. There are many different styles of poetry, groups of poets who disagree, and different ways of presenting and teaching poetry. People also have very different opinions about the poet's role in society.

In general, the main disagreement in modern poetry is between two types of poets. On one side are serious 'literary' writers. Their poems are meant to be printed and read from a page. On the other side are 'popular' performing poets. They also publish their poems, but they prefer to perform them aloud for an audience. Of course, this is not a strict division.

The number of public poetry readings has been growing for about twenty years. They happen in many different places. Small literary groups hold them in village halls or in people's homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and speak to students. Arts festivals often include poetry readings by famous writers in their programs. Because of this, many poets now have to become public performers. The effects of this are many, and it is not always good for them as artists.

For 'pop' poets, who write their work specifically to be performed for an audience, the situation is simple. They benefit from public performance. Their poems are often simple in form and meaning, so people can understand them immediately when they hear them. It is when these poems are printed that their weaknesses in thought and technique become obvious.

Poets who are dedicated to their art and are trying to continue the best traditions of poetry face a different challenge. Their work often contains deep feelings, complex thoughts, and clever uses of rhythm and language. An audience hearing their work for the first time may not appreciate it. The danger for these poets is not that they will copy the style of the entertainers. The danger is that, to communicate quickly with the audience, they might only read their simplest and most accessible work, which is often not their best or most representative work.

Going to a poetry reading is not a replacement for reading poetry from a book, but it can be a useful and enjoyable addition. Hearing good poets read their work aloud is a valuable way to learn where the important stresses and meanings are in the poem. It is best if the audience can read the text while listening or already know the poems. The main reason for popular poetry recitals, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences connect poetry with enjoyment. This helps people see that poetry is not an art form only for a small, expert group.","POETRY RECITALS

At any moment in history, the literary world tends to seem disorganised to those living in that period. It is only later, when people look back, that clear patterns and important figures emerge. Currently, poetry is experiencing a particularly confusing variety of styles, competing groups, and different opinions about how poetry should be presented, judged, taught, and what role poets should play in society.

In general terms, a major division in modern poetry exists between serious literary poets, who write mainly to be read in print, and popular performance poets, who prefer to present their work directly to audiences, even if they also publish it. These two groups often view each other with mutual distrust, though the distinction between them is not completely clear.

Over the past twenty years, the organisation of public poetry readings has steadily increased in many different forms. Small literary societies hold them in village halls or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to read and speak to students; arts festivals frequently include poetry readings by well-known writers in their programmes. The effects of this trend—and the growing expectation that poets should also be performers—are numerous, and it's uncertain whether this development is entirely good for poetry itself.

For performance poets, who often write specifically to be heard by live audiences, public readings are clearly beneficial. Their work is usually simple in both structure and content, making it easy to understand when heard once. However, when written down, its weaknesses in thought, technique and imagination may become apparent. Meanwhile, poets dedicated to their art—those trying to continue and develop the best poetic traditions by expressing deep feeling, thought and insight with great precision and subtle rhythmic effects—are unlikely to be properly appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. The danger for these poets is not that they will copy popular performers, but that in trying to communicate immediately, they might read only their most easily understood work, which is often their least significant or representative.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry privately, though it can be a useful and enjoyable addition. Hearing poets read their work aloud—even if they are not skilled public speakers—provides valuable guidance about where the intended emphasis should be. However, it is better if listeners either follow the reading with the text or already know the poems being read. The main value of popular poetry recitals, which sometimes include musical performances (like the once popular combination of jazz and poetry), is that they help audiences connect poetry with pleasure rather than seeing it as an art form only for a small, expert group.",
296,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark, motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day. When he had first bought the flat, he used to come home in an eager, questioning mood - often as early as he could -- wondering what it had been doing during the hours he had been away. It had represented a form of welcome to him, a region in which his focus was undisputed and reliable. He supposed that he should have worried about intruders or burst drains in that moment of reunion, but his flat had always been sitting waiting for him with an expression of independence or of neglect, depending on whether he'd left it tidy or not. In the end he had begun to regard it merely as another cloistered annexe of himself, a space into which the stuffy chambers of his heart and head had gradually overspilled their contents.
He had grown impatient with its inability to be transformed. There was, of course, the small, angular puddle of letters which sometimes gathered by the door and the red eye of the answering machine which could occasionally be found resuscitated and blinking with life when he returned. And he was grateful that the glassy eyes of his windows hadn't been smashed nor the contents ravished with violence, mind you, he wondered what the flat would look like afterwards.
From the dreary distance of his shabby third-floor office on the Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four solitary evenings at home each week. Once he had fled the fabricated world of the office and felt the memory of himself begin patchily to return on his bus journey home, he no longer needed to be on his own, a fact which seemed continually to elude him in his social calculations. Sitting exposed at his desk he would crave isolation, unlimited time alone amongst his possessions, but the relief of escape drained him and he would vainly wait for some sense of selfhood to return. Instead, there was merely a resounding emptiness, which made him suspect during his long hours of loneliness that the alien exercise of doing work which did not suit him had forced him to change, moving him further and further from what he liked to think of as himself. He would often read or listen to music as the night deepened outside, familiar habits which now, however, he would find himself asking for whom or what he did them. His points of reference had grown dim, his signposts muddied: sensations and ideas would arrive and then get lost, circulating around the junctions of his mind, unable to find a connection.
There had been a time, he supposed, when he had not felt this powerless, when, had he but perceived his own worth, he might have escaped; but he had been so eager to fix himself up with something that he had been swept along by this great desire for something, and he had followed the first course which presented itself as if it had been ordained that he should do so.
He had tried, of course, after he left university, to formulate some plan for his own betterment, but it hadn't really surprised him to find, when he searched himself for ambition, merely the desire unobtrusively to survive. He had applied for the types of jobs which had become familiar to him though the talk of his peers, had latched himself wearily on to their futures and jogged behind as they rushed towards them, unable to imagine that he might be put to some use which would manufacture as its by-product his own happiness.
He had attended his only interview gratefully, and in the fever of examination did not think to test the position - an inexplicit editorial role on a free local newspaper for its own merits. Relieved at having pulled off twenty minutes of pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, he had not considered the future of lengthy encounters by which he was now daily assaulted. Neil had offered him the job there and then, telling him he was the only graduate who had applied; a revelation which at the time Ralph had obscurely taken as a compliment.",C2,"Ralph opened his door. He went into the dark hall. He felt a little strange. He felt this way when he came home alone. He lived in his flat for three years.

When he first got the flat, he was happy to come home. He came home early. He thought about his flat when he was not there. The flat was his place. It was always there for him. It was clean or not clean. He did not think about bad people or broken things.

Now, he felt the flat was a part of him. He wanted the flat to be new, but it was the same. Sometimes letters were by the door. Sometimes a light on his phone was on. He was happy his windows were OK and his things were safe.

Ralph worked in an office. He did not like his work. He liked his quiet nights at home. On the bus home, he felt better. Then he did not want to be alone.

At work, he wanted to be alone with his things. But at home, he felt tired. He felt empty. He did not feel like himself. At night, he read or listened to music. But he did not know why he did these things now. His thoughts were not clear.

He thought about a time when he felt strong. He thought he could get a different job. But he wanted a job a lot. He took the first job he found.

After school, he tried to make a good life. But he only wanted a quiet life. He asked for jobs his friends talked about. He did what his friends did. He did not think of a job to make him happy.

He went to one meeting for a job. He was happy to be there. He talked to a man named Neil. They talked for twenty minutes. It was a good talk. Neil gave him the job.

Now, he talks to people at work all day, and he does not like it.",,"Ralph unlocked the door to his rented flat. He walked into the dark, quiet hall and felt a small worry.

It looked independent or a bit messy, depending on if he had tidied up. After a while, he started to see the flat as just another part of himself. It was a space where his thoughts and feelings could be.

He had become impatient because the flat could not really change. Sometimes, a small pile of letters was by the door. Sometimes, the red light on his answering machine was blinking.

The feeling of leaving work made him tired, and he waited to feel like himself, but the feeling didn't come. Instead, he felt empty. He thought that his job, which he didn't like, was changing him. It was moving him away from the person he thought he was.

In the evening, he often read or listened to music. These were things he always did. But now he asked himself why he did them. He felt lost. Thoughts and feelings came but then went away, moving around in his mind without any direction.

He thought there was a time when he felt stronger. If he had known his own value then, he might have done something different. But he was so keen to find something for himself that he just followed the first opportunity that came along.

After university, he tried to make a plan for a better life. But it didn't surprise him to find that he didn't have big dreams. He just wanted a quiet life. He applied for the same kinds of jobs his friends talked about. He followed their plans for the future because he couldn't imagine a job that would also make him happy.

He was happy to get one interview. He was so nervous that he didn't really think about the job. It was an unclear role at a free local newspaper. He was just relieved that he had a nice 20-minute talk with Neil, who would be his boss. He didn't think about the long, boring meetings he would have every day.

297,"Art on TV

Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera, which has the ability to show a whole work of art, then move in close to examine the details. Yet I can think of few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of looking at them.
A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

Dealing in Metals

For 20 years I worked as an international metals dealer and gained something of a reputation as a speculator. Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into allegations made against one of the multinational conglomerates that benefit from these cheap raw materials.

Extract from a Holiday Brochure

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas that stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer, to Cuba. Each one has its own personality, each one has something to offer.
The key to getting anywhere in the islands and cays of Abaco is a boat. If you don't get one thrown in with the room don't worry. Be happy. There are ferries galore. And water-taxis. Or, there are plenty of boats to rent if you prefer to go under your own steam.
But sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason.
Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that gems can be found. At night it's the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay that sparkle.",C2,,,"Art on TV

Why are TV shows about art often not very good? Painting and sculpture should be perfect for television. The camera can show a whole work of art and then show small details up close. But I can't think of many TV series that show how interesting and complex art can be.

A good example of what often goes wrong is Robert Hughes's eight-part show about American art, called American Visions. Hughes is a good art expert. He is interesting to watch, and he had eight hours to teach British people about American art, which British art galleries usually ignore. I thought the show would be about great works of art. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

Working with Metals

For 20 years, I bought and sold metals around the world. I became known as someone who took risks. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. If you are lucky, you are ready to take a risk, and you understand the market, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this job. This way of working fits well with a free global economy. But now, people who believed free markets would keep the price of rare metals high are seeing the opposite happen. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the cost of raw materials is going down. If you think about inflation, most metals cost about half as much as they did 20 years ago. Recently, someone asked me to check some claims made against a large international company that uses these cheap materials.

Abaco and its small nearby islands are part of the Bahamas. The Bahamas are a group of 700 islands that go from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer, near Cuba. Every island is different and has something special to offer.

To travel around the Abaco islands, you need a boat. If your hotel room doesn't include a boat, don't worry. There are many ferries and water-taxis. Or, you can rent a boat if you want to go by yourself.

Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. People call Abaco 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason.

The calm, safe water is also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkelling, and swimming. The small islands and their beaches go on for 200 miles like a line of pearls. You can find beautiful things on land too. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly.","Art on TV

Why do TV programs about art often not succeed? Painting and sculpture should be perfect for television because cameras can show a whole artwork and then focus on small details. However, there are very few TV series that successfully show how enjoyable and complex it can be to look at art.

A clear example of this problem is Robert Hughes's eight-part program about American art, called American Visions. Hughes is a reliable art expert with a strong personality, and he was given almost eight hours to teach British viewers about a type of art that British museums have paid little attention to. I thought the series would concentrate on important artworks. Instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown through its art and buildings.

Working with Metals

I spent 20 years as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. If you are lucky, willing to take chances, and understand how the market operates, you can earn a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this business. This adventurous attitude matches well with a global free-market economy. But now, economists who believed that the market alone would keep the price of rare metals high are discovering the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken from the earth, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When you consider inflation, most metals cost about half as much as they did 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims made against one of the large international companies that profit from these low material costs.

Abaco and its small surrounding islands are part of the Bahamas, which include 700 islands running from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer toward Cuba. Each island has its own character and something special to offer.

To travel around the Abaco islands, you really need a boat. If your accommodation doesn’t include one, don’t worry. There are plenty of ferries and water-taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to travel independently.

Sailing is the most common way to get around here. Abaco is known as ""The Sailing Capital of the World,"" and for good reason.

The calm, sheltered waters are also ideal for fishing, diving, snorkelling, and swimming. The small islands and their beaches extend for 200 miles like a beautiful necklace. You can find treasures on land too. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly.","The Shortcomings of Television in Covering the Visual Arts

Why does television so often fail to do justice to the visual arts? Painting and sculpture seem like natural subjects for television, since cameras can show a complete artwork and then zoom in to study the details. Yet there are very few television series that have managed to capture both the enjoyment and the complexity of looking at art.

A clear example of this problem is Robert Hughes’s eight-part series about American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic who is widely respected. He has a strong on-screen presence and was given almost eight hours to introduce British audiences to a field of art that British galleries have largely ignored. I expected the series to concentrate on important artworks. Instead, it focused on how American history and culture are expressed through its art and architecture.

Working in the Metals Trade

For twenty years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is much less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good knowledge of how the market operates, it is possible to earn a great deal of money. Taking risks is a fundamental part of the business. This adventurous approach fits well with a global free-market economy. But now, free-trade economists who believed the market alone would keep the price of scarce metals high are finding the opposite is true. More minerals are being mined, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When you account for inflation, most metals cost about half what they did twenty years ago. I was recently asked to investigate accusations made against one of the large international companies that profit from these low-cost materials.

There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know
I may be preaching to the converted, because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one, but so often we imagine that, unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish, it is hardly worth attempting. Not so. Just by throwing a few roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery and a few herbs into water you will get the most delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a tin. Instead of buying an over-sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, emulsifiers and additives, in five minutes you can turn out the most delicious confection that both grown-ups and children will love.
Cooking is also an offering, and it is a gesture of care and love to bring once own creation, however humble or simple, to the table. Sharing food is so rich in symbolism, of our deepest human needs, that it is hardly surprising all our festivities and celebrations take place around tables, be they birthdays, anniversaries, engagements or whatever! No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! Nor would many people wish to have a business deal discussed over tinned soup.

In the Elevator

This morning, Alistair had made a stab at straightening up his office, but correspondence still littered every surface. Quarterly tax forms, state and federal, bulged out of desk drawers and cardboard boxes, all waiting on a day when he was in the filing mode. And then there was all the added paperwork that went along with owning an apartment building. The hundred-odd books and a few years' worth of journals were only in proximity to the new bookshelves.
As the elevator bore him closer to his floor, he knew that Mallory would be on time for their appointment. She would be knocking on the door of his empty office on the hour, not a second before or after. She was as compulsive about time as she was about neatness.
How would she react to the mess? She might assume he'd been vandalised. He could walk in behind her and feign shock.
Mrs Wilson, his cleaning woman, had arrived while he was scrambling around on the floor, trying desperately to clear a few square feet of the carpet. Putting his head out of the office door as she was turning her key in the lock of his apartment, he had smiled at her, his eyes filled with hope. Her own eyes had turned hard. Fat chance I'm going in there, said the back of her head as she had disappeared into his residence, which was her territory and all that she might be held accountable for.
He knew Mrs Wilson believed him to be a visitor from somewhere else, perhaps some point straight up, miles out, but nowhere on the surface of her own earth, which was square and shaped by the streets of Brooklyn.

KAREN

It was a simple desire - not to be like her mother - that led Karen to create her own story, her own mythology, a mythology of difference and strength. Tn the tale that she constructed for herself, there were significant moments in her progress; such as the day she was twelve years old and her brother quick-swung a golf club behind him and hit her full in the eye. At the first moment of impact, she was convinced of immediate blindness. But the bone hod protected her, as the doctor from the high-walled house later assured her. The golf club had clean missed the eye and she was left with only a few stitches that healed to a pole drawing of past suffering. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's white-walled consulting room, overlooking the tennis courts, ond saw her mother clear before her, muttering predictably and paradoxically about both miracles and small mercies, she knew that she was saved for some purpose.

Miss Fogerty

Miss Fogerty, returning briskly to her duties across the wet grass of the village green, was both excited and saddened by the scene she had just witnessed. It is always exhilarating to be the first to know something of note, particularly in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's quiet life held little excitement. On the other hand, her grief for Dr Bailey's condition was overwhelming. He has attended her for many years and she remembered with gratitude his concern for her annual bouts of laryngitis which were, fortunately, about the only troubles for which she had to consult him.
His most valuable quality, Miss Fogerty considered, was his making one feel that there was always plenty of time, and that he truly wished to hear about his patients' fears and perplexities. It was this quality, above all others, which had so endeared the good doctor to the village and its environs. He had always been prepared to give -- of his time, of his knowledge, and of his humour. His reward had been outstanding loyalty and affection.",C2,,"**Food**

Food is important and makes us happy. I think you like cooking because you are reading this book. Sometimes we think we should only cook for special days or difficult meals. But this is not true. You can make a very good soup with carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. It is better than soup from a packet or a tin. You can also make a chocolate mousse in five minutes. It is delicious and good for everyone. A bought mousse has a lot of sugar and other things in it.

Cooking is a way to show you care. When you make food for people, it is a kind of love. We often eat together for happy times like birthdays or other parties. People do not get takeaway food for a wedding. And people do not talk about business while eating soup from a tin.

**In the Elevator**

Alistair's office was very messy. There were papers and books everywhere. He was going to his office in the elevator. He knew Mallory would come to see him at the right time. She always arrives exactly on time. She likes things to be neat and clean.

He thought about her seeing his messy office. She might think someone broke in. He could act surprised when he walked in.

His cleaner, Mrs. Wilson, came to his apartment while he was trying to clean his office. He smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked angry and went into his apartment. She only cleans his apartment, not his office. He thinks Mrs. Wilson feels he is very different from her and does not understand her life in Brooklyn.

**Karen**

Karen did not want to be like her mother. This made her create her own strong story. One important time was when she was twelve. Her brother hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she could not see. But the doctor said the bone protected her eye. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes at the doctor's, she saw her mother talking about miracles. Karen then felt she was saved for a special reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty walked quickly across the wet grass. She felt excited and sad about what she just saw. She was happy to know important news first. Her life is usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey. He was her doctor for many years. He was always kind when she lost her voice every year.

She thought his best quality was that he made people feel he had a lot of time for them. He really listened to his patients' problems. This made people in the village love him very much. He always gave his time, his knowledge, and made jokes. People were very loyal and loved him because of this.","**Food**

There is something very simple and good about our relationship with food. I know you might already agree, because people who like cooking buy books like this one. But sometimes we think that unless it is a special day or a very difficult recipe, it is not worth trying. This is not true. If you just put some chopped carrots, a leek, some celery and a few herbs into water, you can make a very tasty soup. This feels much better than buying a packet or a tin of soup. Instead of buying a very sweet chocolate mousse with lots of additives, in five minutes you can make a delicious dessert that adults and children will enjoy.

Cooking is also a way to show you care. It is a kind of love to bring something you made yourself, even if it is simple, to the table. Sharing food is full of meaning. It is about our most basic human needs. So it is not surprising that all our special days, like birthdays or anniversaries, happen around a table. No one would get a takeaway for a wedding! And not many people would want to discuss a business deal while eating soup from a tin.

**In the Elevator**

This morning, Alistair tried to tidy his office, but papers were still on every table. Tax forms filled the desk drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like filing. There was also a lot of extra paperwork because he owned an apartment building. His many books and journals were near the new bookshelves, but not on them.

As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew that Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the right time, not a second early or late. She was very strict about time, just like she was about being tidy.

What would she think of the mess? She might think someone had broken in and made it dirty. He could walk in after her and pretend to be shocked.

His cleaner, Mrs Wilson, had arrived while he was on the floor, trying to clear a small space on the carpet. He looked out of his office door as she was opening his apartment and smiled at her with hope in his eyes. But her eyes became hard. 'No chance I am going in there,' her body seemed to say as she walked into his home. That was her area, and the only place she felt responsible for.

He knew Mrs Wilson thought he was like a visitor from another world, not from her own world, which was the streets of Brooklyn.

**Karen**

Karen had one simple wish: she did not want to be like her mother. This made her create her own story, a story about being different and strong. In the story she told herself, there were important moments. One day, when she was twelve, her brother swung a golf club behind him and hit her in the eye. At first, she thought she had gone blind. But the bone had protected her, as the doctor later told her. The golf club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. The cut healed and left only a small, pale mark. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's white room and saw her mother clearly, talking as usual about miracles and small kindnesses, she knew she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**

Miss Fogerty walked quickly back to work across the wet grass. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is always exciting to be the first to know important news, especially in a small village, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually very quiet. However, she felt very sad about Dr Bailey's illness. He had been her doctor for many years, and she was thankful that he always cared about her yearly sore throat. Luckily, that was almost the only time she needed to see him.

Miss Fogerty thought his best quality was that he made you feel there was always enough time, and that he really wanted to listen to his patients' worries and problems. This was the main reason why everyone in the village and the area around it liked the good doctor so much. He was always ready to give his time, his knowledge, and his humour. Because of this, people were very loyal and liked him very much.","**Food**

Our connection with food is basic and very satisfying. I know that people who enjoy cooking probably already agree, since they buy cookbooks like this. But we often think that unless it's a special event or a complicated recipe, it's not worth trying. This isn't true. If you just put some roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery, and a few herbs into water, you can make a delicious soup. This feels much better than opening a tin or using a packet mix.

Instead of buying a chocolate mousse that is too sweet and full of additives, you can make a wonderful dessert in just five minutes that everyone will enjoy.

Cooking is also a way of giving. Preparing a meal, even a simple one, is an act of care and love. Sharing food is a powerful symbol of our basic human needs. It's no surprise that our important celebrations, like birthdays or anniversaries, always happen around a table. You wouldn't serve takeaway food at a wedding! Similarly, few people would want to discuss a business deal over a meal of tinned soup.

299,"THE WELL

I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole, one could see the stars, if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched, eyes wide, fist to mouth, as I winched up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I had not thought to allow for the bucket's much increased weight, your lack of strength or inclination to just stand back and let what would happen, happen. You held the handle, taking some of the strain as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well's stone surround. Freed of the wall's support, I plunged immediately. You gave a little shriek and made one attempt to brake the handle, then you let it go. I fell into the well. I cracked my head.
It did not occur to me then that I had succeeded, in a sense, in my plan. What I saw were lights, strange, inchoate and bizarre. It was only later that I connected the visual symptoms of that fall and impact with the stylised stars and planets I was used to seeing drawn in a cartoon panel whenever a comic character suffered a similar whack.
At the time I was at first just dazed, then frightened, then relieved, then finally both angry at you for letting me fall and afraid of what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was all right. I opened my mouth to shout, and then you called again, a note of rising panic in your voice, and with those words stopped mine in my throat. I lay still, eyelids cracked enough to watch you through the foliage of lashes. You disappeared, calling out for help. I waited a moment, then quickly hauled and pushed my way to the top, then pulled myself over the edge and landed on the courtyard cobbles.
I could hear raised, alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the opposite way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows there.
Mother and Father both appeared along with you and old Arthur; Mother shrieked, flapping her hands. Father shouted and told Arthur to haul on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked, watching. I was bowed in the shadows. A fire of fierce elation filled me. Then I saw the line of drops I'd left, from the well to where I now stood. I looked in horror at the spots, dark coins of dirty well water fallen from my soaking clothes on to the dry, grey cobbles. At my feet, in the darkness, the water had formed a little pool.
I looked back into the courtyard, to where Father was now shining a flashlight down into the well and peering into the gloom. The drops I had left shone in the sunlight. I could not believe that nobody had seen them. Mother was screaming hysterically now, a sharp, jarring noise that I had never heard before. It shook my soul, suffused my conscience. What was I to do? I had had my revenge on you, but where did I go from here?
This had quickly become more serious than I'd anticipated, escalating with dizzying rapidity from a great prank born of a brilliant brainwave to something that would not be put to rest without some serious, painful and lasting punishment being inflicted on somebody, almost certainly myself. I cursed myself for not thinking this through. From crafty plan, to downfall, to wheeze, to calamity; all in a few minutes.
The plan came to me like a lifebelt to a drowning man. I gathered all my courage and left my hiding place, coming staggering out and blinking. I cried out faintly, one hand to my brow, then yelled out a little louder when my first cry went unheeded. I stumbled on a little further, then collapsed dramatically on the cobbles.
Sitting up, comforted, my head in my weeping mother's bosom, I went 'Phew' and said 'Oh dear' and smiled bravely and claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and crawled and swum along it until I got out, climbed up the bridge and tottered, exhausted, through the passageway.
To this day I think I was almost getting away with it until Father appeared squatting in front of me. He had me repeat my story. I did so, hesitating. His eyes narrowed.
Thinking I was plugging a gap, in fact only adding another log to my pyre, I said that the secret passage had fallen in after me; there wouldn't be any point in, say, sending somebody down to look for it. In fact the whole well was dangerous. I'd barely escaped with my life. I looked into my father's eyes and it was like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars at the end.
It was as though he was seeing me for the first time, and as though I was looking down a secret passage through time, to an adult perspective, to the way the world and cocky, lying children's stories would look to me when I was his age.
My words died in my throat. 'Don't be ridiculous, boy,' he said, investing more contempt in those few words than I'd have thought a whole language capable of conveying. He rose smoothly to his feet and walked away.
Arthur looked down at me, his expression regretful and troubled, shaking his head or looking like he wanted to, not because I had had a terrifying adventure and then been unjustly disbelieved by my own father, but because he too could see through my forlorn and hapless lie, and worried for the soul, the character, the future moral standing of any child so shameless - and so incompetent - in its too easily resorted-to lying.
In that pity was a rebuke as severe and wounding as that my father had administered, and in as much that it confirmed that this was the mature judgement of my actions and my father's, not some aberration I might be able to discount or ignore, it affected me even more profoundly.",C2,,,"I had read that you can see the stars from a very deep hole if the day is clear. I asked you to help me. You watched with wide eyes as I took the bucket out of the well and climbed in. I told you to lower me down. I didn't think about how heavy the bucket would be, or that you weren't strong enough to hold it. You tried to hold the handle, but when I pushed away from the wall, I fell. You let out a small scream and let go. I fell into the well and hit my head.

At first, I didn't realize my plan had worked in a way. I saw strange lights. Later, I understood that these lights were like the stars you see in cartoons when a character gets hit.

At the time, I felt dizzy, then scared, then relieved. Then I was angry with you for letting me fall and worried about what my mother would say. You called down to ask if I was okay. I was about to shout back, but I heard the fear in your voice and stayed quiet. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed out of the well and landed on the stones in the courtyard.

I heard loud, worried voices from the castle door. I ran the other way, toward the bridge over the moat, and hid in the shadows.

My mother and father came out with you and old Arthur. My mother was crying and waving her hands. My father shouted at Arthur to turn the handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hiding, feeling a strange excitement. Then I saw the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. At my feet, a small pool of water had formed.

I looked back into the courtyard. My father was shining a light into the well. The water drops shone in the sun. I couldn't believe no one saw them. My mother was screaming in a way I had never heard before. It scared me and made me feel guilty. What should I do? I had my revenge on you, but what now?

This had become much more serious than I expected. My clever idea had turned into something that would end with serious punishment, probably for me. I was angry with myself for not thinking it through. My plan had gone wrong very quickly.

Then I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place. I walked out, blinking, and called out weakly. When no one heard me, I called louder. I walked a little further and then fell onto the stones.

Sitting up, with my crying mother holding me, I said ""Phew"" and ""Oh dear."" I bravely said that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat. I said I swam along it, climbed out, and walked, tired, to the bridge.

I thought I was getting away with it until my father came and stood in front of me. He asked me to tell the story again. I did, but I was not sure. He looked at me closely.

Trying to make my story better, I said the tunnel had fallen in after me. I said it was too dangerous to send anyone down to look. I said I was lucky to be alive. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light.

It was as if he was seeing the real me for the first time. I felt like I could see the future, and how my silly lies would look when I was an adult.

I stopped talking. ""Don't be silly, boy,"" he said. His voice was full of anger. He stood up and walked away.

Arthur looked down at me. He seemed sad and worried. He shook his head, not because he felt sorry for me, but because he knew I was lying. He was worried about a child who would lie so easily and so badly.

His pity hurt as much as my father's anger. It showed me that this was the real opinion of my actions, and it affected me deeply.","I had read that if you look up from a very deep well on a clear day, you can see the stars. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, placed it on the wall, and climbed inside. I told you to lower me down. I hadn't considered that the bucket would be too heavy for you, or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to support my weight, but when I pushed away from the wall, I fell immediately. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head.

At the time, I didn't realize that in a way, my plan had worked. I saw strange, unclear lights. Only later did I connect those lights with the cartoon stars you see when a character hits their head.

At first, I was just confused, then scared, then relieved. Finally, I felt angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what my mother would say. You called down, asking if I was okay. I was about to shout back when you called again, sounding panicked, and that stopped me. I stayed still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed out of the well and dropped onto the courtyard stones.

I could hear worried voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the other way, toward the bridge over the moat, and hid in the shadows.

My mother and father appeared with you and old Arthur. My mother was crying and waving her hands. My father shouted at Arthur to start pulling up the bucket. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. Hidden in the shadows, I felt a sudden excitement. Then I saw the trail of water drops I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, a small puddle had formed.

I looked back into the courtyard. My father was shining a flashlight into the well. The water drops I left behind shone in the sunlight. I couldn't believe no one had noticed them. My mother was now screaming hysterically, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me and made me feel guilty. What should I do? I had gotten my revenge on you, but what now?

This had become much more serious than I expected. What started as a clever trick had turned into something that would lead to serious punishment, probably for me. I was angry at myself for not thinking it through. My clever plan had turned into a disaster in just a few minutes.

Then I had an idea. I gathered my courage, left my hiding place, and stumbled out, blinking. I called out weakly, holding my head. When no one noticed, I called a little louder. I walked forward unsteadily and then fell dramatically onto the stones.

Sitting up, with my head against my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear."" I bravely smiled and explained that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat. I said I had crawled and swum through it, climbed up near the bridge, and walked weakly through the passage.

I thought I was getting away with it until my father knelt in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I did, hesitating. He narrowed his eyes.

Trying to make my story stronger, I said the tunnel had collapsed behind me, so there was no point in sending anyone to check. In fact, the whole well was dangerous. I had almost died. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light at the end.

It was as if he was truly seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing myself from an adult's point of view—how the world and a child's confident lies would look when I was his age.

My words stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, with more disgust than I thought possible in so few words. He stood up and walked away.

Arthur looked down at me, his face sad and concerned. He shook his head, not because he felt sorry that my father didn't believe my adventure, but because he saw through my weak, hopeless lie. He was worried about the character and future of a child who would lie so easily—and so poorly.

His pity felt like a sharp criticism, as painful as my father's words. And because it confirmed that this was the fair judgment of my actions—not something I could ignore—it hurt me even more deeply.","THE WELL

I had once read that from a sufficiently deep well, one could see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to assist me with my plan; you watched, wide-eyed and with your fist pressed to your mouth, as I raised the bucket, steadied it on the wall, and climbed inside. I instructed you to lower me down. I had failed to account for the bucket’s increased weight, your lack of strength, or your possible reluctance to intervene. You held the handle, taking some of the strain as I pushed away from the stone edge. Once free of the wall’s support, I dropped instantly. You let out a short cry, tried briefly to slow the handle, then released it. I fell and struck my head.

At the time, it did not occur to me that I had, in a way, achieved my goal. What I saw were strange, undefined lights—only later did I connect those visual disturbances with the cartoon stars and planets that appear when a character suffers a blow.

Initially, I was merely dazed, then frightened, then relieved, and finally both angry with you for letting me fall and fearful of what Mother would say. You called down to ask if I was all right. I opened my mouth to reply, but your voice grew more panicked, and your words silenced mine. I lay still, peering through my lashes as you disappeared, calling for help. After a moment, I quickly climbed out, pulling myself over the edge and landing on the courtyard cobbles.

I could hear alarmed voices coming from the castle’s main entrance. I ran the other way, toward the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows.

Soon Mother, Father, you, and old Arthur appeared. Mother shrieked and flapped her hands. Father shouted at Arthur to operate the winch. You stood back, pale and shocked. Crouched in the shadows, I felt a surge of fierce satisfaction. Then I noticed the trail of drops I had left from the well to my hiding place. I stared in horror at the dark spots of dirty well water on the dry cobbles. At my feet, a small puddle had formed in the dark.

I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops I had left gleamed in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had noticed them. Mother was now screaming hysterically—a piercing, unsettling sound I had never heard before. It shook me to the core and filled me with guilt. What was I to do? I had taken revenge on you, but what came next?

The situation had escalated far beyond what I had expected. What began as a clever prank had rapidly become something that would surely end in serious and lasting punishment—most likely for me. I cursed myself for not thinking it through. In just a few minutes, my scheme had gone from a cunning idea to a disaster.

Then, like a lifebelt to a drowning man, a plan came to me. Summoning my courage, I staggered from my hiding place, blinking and calling out faintly. When no one responded, I raised my voice, stumbled a few steps, and collapsed dramatically on the cobbles.

Sitting up, comforted with my head against my weeping mother, I sighed, said “Oh dear,” and bravely claimed that I had discovered a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat. I said I had crawled and swum through it, climbed the bridge, and stumbled, exhausted, through the passage.

For a moment, I thought I might succeed—until Father knelt before me. He made me repeat my story. I did so, hesitating. He narrowed his eyes.

Thinking I was covering a flaw in my account—but only making things worse—I added that the tunnel had collapsed behind me, so there was no point in sending anyone to check. In fact, the well itself was now dangerous. I had barely escaped with my life. When I looked into my father’s eyes, it was like staring into a dark tunnel with no light at the end.

It was as if he were truly seeing me for the first time, and as if I were glimpsing my own future—how the world, and the arrogant lies of children, would appear to me when I reached his age.

My words died in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, packing more contempt into those few words than I thought possible. He rose smoothly and walked away.

Arthur looked down at me, his expression troubled and regretful. He shook his head—not because I had endured a frightening ordeal only to be disbelieved, but because he saw through my hopeless, clumsy lie. He seemed to pity the soul of a child so willing—and so unskilled—in deceit.

That pity felt like a rebuke as severe as my father’s. And because it confirmed that this was the considered judgment of an adult—not something I could dismiss—it affected me even more deeply.",
300,"AESTHETICS

By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. In common conception, the work of art is often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. Since the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience, the result is not favourable to understanding. In addition, the very perfection of some of these products, the prestige they possess because of a long history of unquestioned admiration, creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When an art product once attains classic status, it somehow becomes isolated from the human conditions under which it was brought into being and from the human consequences it engenders in actual life experience.
When artistic objects are separated from both conditions of origin and operation in experience, a wall is built around them that renders almost opaque their general significance, with which aesthetic theory deals. Art is remitted to a separate realm, where it is cut off from that association with the materials and aims of every other form of human effort and achievement. A primary task is thus imposed upon one who undertakes to write upon the philosophy of the fine arts. This task is to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings that are universally recognised to constitute experience. Mountain peaks do not float unsupported, they do not even just rest upon the earth. They are the earth in one of its manifest operations. It is the business of those who are concerned with the theory of the earth, geographers and geologists, to make this fact evident in its various implications. The theorist who would deal philosophically with fine art has a like task to accomplish.
If one is willing to grant this position, even if only by way of temporary experiment, one will see that there follows a conclusion which is at first sight surprising. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time, to turn aside from them and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. For theory is concerned with understanding and insight. It is, of course, quite possible to enjoy flowers in their coloured form and delicate fragrance without knowing anything about plants theoretically. But if one sets out to understand the flowering of plants, one is committed to finding out something about the interactions of soil, air, water and sunlight that condition the growth of plants. 
In order to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw, in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear, arousing one's interest and affording enjoyment as one looks and listens. Yet so extensive and subtly pervasive are the ideas that set art itself upon a remote pedestal that many people would be repelled rather than pleased if told that they enjoyed their casual recreations, in part at least, because of their aesthetic quality.The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts: for instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events. For, when what they know as art is relegated to the museum and gallery, the unconquerable impulse towards experiences enjoyable in themselves finds such outlet as the daily environment provides. Many people who protest against the museum conception of art still share the fallacy from which that conception springs. For the popular notion comes from a separation of art from the objects and scenes of ordinary experience that many theorists and critics pride themselves upon holding and even elaborating. The times when select and distinguished objects are closely connected with the products of usual vocations are the times when appreciation of the former is most rife and most keen.
",C2,,"Aesthetics

It can be hard to understand art. One reason is that we think of art only as a thing, like a painting or a statue. We forget that art is really about how it makes us feel.

Some art is very famous. People have liked it for a long time. This can make it hard to see the art in a new way. When art is too famous, it feels far away from normal life and why it was made.

This is a problem for people who write about art. Their job is to show how great art is part of our everyday life. Art should not be in a special world. It is part of life, like a mountain is part of the earth.

To understand art, we should not only look at famous art. We should look at simple things we see every day. For example, to understand a flower, you need to know about sun and water. To understand art, you need to look at normal life.

Many people enjoy movies or music but do not call it art. They think ""real"" art is only in museums. But art is all around us. Art is best when it is part of normal life, not when it is kept in a special place.","**AESTHETICS**

It can be difficult to understand art, and sometimes the art itself is the problem. There are two main reasons for this.

First, people often think a work of art is just a physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue. But real art is about the experience people have with it. When we forget this, we do not understand art well.

Second, some art is seen as perfect because people have admired it for a very long time. This creates old-fashioned ideas that stop us from having new thoughts. When a piece of art becomes a 'classic', people often forget the human story of how it was made and how it makes us feel.

When we separate art from how it was made and how we experience it, we build a wall around it. This makes its true meaning hard to see. Art is put in a special place, away from everyday life and other normal human activities.

So, the job for someone who writes about art is to connect great art back to normal life. Art should not be separate. It comes from our daily experiences, feelings, and actions. Think of mountains: they are not separate from the earth; they are a part of it. In the same way, art is a part of human life.

If we accept this idea, we find a surprising conclusion. To understand art, we sometimes need to stop looking at famous artworks. Instead, we should look at the ordinary things in life that we enjoy. We can find beauty in these everyday experiences. To build a theory of art, we must take this different path.

Of course, you can enjoy a flower without knowing anything about plants. But if you want to understand why a plant has flowers, you must learn about the soil, air, water, and sun that help it grow. In the same way, to understand great art, you must start with the simple beauty in everyday life.

However, many people think of art as something very special and distant. They might not like to hear that the fun things they enjoy—like movies, jazz music, comic strips, or exciting news stories—have artistic quality. For most people, the most lively and interesting arts are things they do not even call 'art'.

This happens because when people think of 'real' art, they think of museums and galleries. So, their natural wish for enjoyable experiences finds a way out in their daily lives. Many people who say they do not like the 'museum' idea of art still believe in the basic mistake that causes it. This mistake is the idea that art is separate from normal life, an idea that some experts are proud of.

The best times for art are when special objects are closely connected to the things people make in their everyday jobs. That is when people appreciate and understand art the most.","AESTHETICS

It is ironic that the very artworks that help us form ideas about art can sometimes block our understanding of them. One reason is that these works exist as physical objects—buildings, books, paintings, or statues—separate from human experience. But the real work of art is what it does in our experience, so this separation makes it harder to understand. Also, some artworks are seen as perfect and have been admired for so long that they create traditions that stop new ideas. When an artwork becomes a classic, it often seems disconnected from the human conditions that created it and from its effect on real life.

When art is separated from how it was made and how it affects us, it becomes hard to see its true meaning. Art is placed in its own special world, cut off from everyday life and other human achievements. So, a key job for anyone writing about art is to reconnect the powerful experiences we get from art with the common events and feelings that make up daily life. Mountains, for example, are not separate from the earth—they are part of it. In the same way, art is part of human experience.

If we accept this idea, we reach a surprising conclusion: to understand art, we must sometimes ignore the artworks themselves and look instead at ordinary experiences that we don't usually think of as art. We need to take an indirect path to art theory. Of course, you can enjoy flowers without knowing anything about plants. But to understand why plants flower, you must learn about the soil, air, water, and sunlight that help them grow.

To understand art in its best forms, we must start with art in its simplest state—in everyday sights and sounds that catch our attention and give us pleasure. Yet many people think of art as something distant and special. They might be upset to hear that they enjoy their casual hobbies partly because of their artistic quality. The art that most people enjoy today includes things they don't even consider art—like movies, jazz, comics, or exciting news stories. When what is called ""art"" is kept only in museums, people find artistic enjoyment in their daily surroundings. Many who disagree with this museum view of art still share the same mistaken idea—that art is separate from ordinary life. In fact, when great artworks are connected to everyday work and life, people appreciate them most deeply.","AESTHETICS

In one of the curious contradictions that often occur in human affairs, the very artworks that form the basis of aesthetic theory have become barriers to understanding them. One reason is that these works exist as physical objects. People commonly think of a work of art as the building, book, painting, or statue itself, separate from human experience. But since the real work of art is what the object creates within our experience, this view prevents proper understanding. Furthermore, the outstanding quality of some works, along with the high reputation they have gained from long and uncritical admiration, creates traditions that block fresh perspectives. Once an art object becomes a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human conditions that created it and from its effects on real life.

When artistic works are separated from both their origins and their role in experience, a barrier forms that hides their wider meaning—which is what aesthetic theory should address. Art is placed in a special category, cut off from the materials and purposes of other human activities and achievements. This creates a key challenge for anyone writing about the philosophy of art: to reconnect the intense and refined experiences offered by artworks with the common events, actions, and emotions that everyone recognises as part of life. Mountain peaks do not float in the air, nor do they simply sit on the earth—they are the earth itself in one of its visible processes. Experts who study the earth, such as geographers and geologists, work to explain this fact and its consequences. The art theorist has a similar job to do.

If we accept this view, even as a temporary experiment, we reach a conclusion that may at first seem unexpected. To understand the meaning of artistic works, we must put them aside for a while and look instead at the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that are not usually seen as aesthetic. We have to approach the theory of art in a roundabout way. After all, theory is about understanding and insight. It is perfectly possible to enjoy the colours and delicate scents of flowers without any knowledge of plant science. But if we want to understand why plants flower, we must learn about the interactions of soil, air, water, and sunlight that allow them to grow.

To understand the aesthetic in its most developed and accepted forms, we must start with it in its basic state—in the everyday events and scenes that catch our eye and ear, hold our interest, and give us pleasure. Yet the ideas that put art on a distant pedestal are so widespread and deeply rooted that many people would be uncomfortable rather than pleased to hear that their everyday enjoyments are partly aesthetic. The arts that are most lively for ordinary people today are often things they do not consider art at all—for instance, film, jazz, comic strips, and, too often, sensational news stories. When what is officially called art is limited to museums and galleries, people’s natural desire for enjoyable experience finds expression in whatever their daily surroundings provide. Many who object to this museum-based idea of art still share the mistaken belief behind it. This common view comes from separating art from the objects and situations of ordinary life—a separation that many theorists and critics are proud to support and develop. In historical periods when highly valued objects were closely connected with everyday work, people’s appreciation of those objects was most common and most enthusiastic.",
301,"Goat Racing

I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans, hordes of people, food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse, I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. An area had been cordoned off to make a course for competitors. Not quite on a par with established racecourses, but on the similar assumption that spectators were to line either side of a stretch of ground along which the participants would travel. An attempt was being made to keep a handful of select goats in order. No mean feat when dealing with an animal fabled to eat almost anything it can get hold of.

Canoe Trip

As the day drew to a close, I started to think about the night ahead, and I shuddered with fear. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, and with the aid of our torch we could just make out the line of the cliffs; the torch batteries were failing, so we put in new ones, but they didn't work. Obviously we weren't going to be able to spot a camping place. A couple of miles later, Lesley called out that she had seen a distant flickering light and our hopes soared: the light turned out to be moonlight glinting on waves, soon we could hear the roaring noise of fast-rushing water, though we couldn't see what was happening. Time stood still, and we moved on.

How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions

I am not a natural at making presentations, yet in my role as managing director I am increasingly required to present infernally to my colleagues, not to mention externally to the major shareholders. How can I improve my presentational techniques and my confidence?
You are not the only one. Making a presentation involves completely different skills from those you need to run a company, yet more and more senior executives are expected to be accomplished at it.
If you are trying to convince your audience of something, you have to be convinced yourself. Demonstrate your conviction in the passion and enthusiasm you bring to the presentation. That means you must do your homework. Test your proposition carefully in advance. Ask colleagues to identify the 'hard questions' your audience might put to you. You also need to build a positive climate from the outset. Begin with an area of common ground that people can identify with and build gradually towards the conclusion you want to reach.",C2,,"**Goat Racing**

I moved through the crowd to find a good spot. A space was closed to make a track for the goats. It was not like a big racecourse, but people stood on both sides to watch. Some people were trying to control a few special goats. This is hard because goats like to eat almost everything.

After some time, Lesley said she saw a small light far away. We felt happy. But the light was only the moon on the water. Then we heard loud, fast water, but we could not see it.

302,"Every Picture Tells a Story

Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction, condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs. I do not mean 'redundancy' in the usual colloquial sense of material which is unnecessary, but in a technical sense.
In a novel, such redundancy would include the repeated allusion to certain traits by which characters are identified, as well as speech tags such as 'he said'. Strictly speaking a character trait needs to be described only once, but it assists comprehension if we are constantly reminded of it. And usually we can infer who is speaking in a scene of dialogue from the content and layout on the page, but speech tags make reading easier.
Stage drama, which consists mostly of speech, imitates and reproduces the redundancy of real speech with various degrees of stylisation. In some modern dramas, this is taken to an extreme, so that the dialogue seems to consist almost entirely of redundant language, whose function is purely phatic (merely establishing contact between the two speakers), leaving us in the dark as to what is being communicated.

Watching Movies

Watching movies, one can be carried away to the degree that one feels part of the world of the moving picture. It is an experience that lifts one out of oneself into a world where one is not beholden to ordinary reality, at least for the length of the film. So it seems that what one feels and does while at the movies does not really count.
But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is abruptly broken, one is again in the ordinary world. One does not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents one from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in my boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'. This was how some people of our parents' generation, and most of our teachers, disparaged the movies. Like most people, they liked to be entertained, but they did not consider the movies to be an art.

The film studios

The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a huddle of many disparate buildings. The topography of the place was irrational and obscure. It possessed, certainly, a few permanent landmarks such as the Script Department, out for the rest it appeared to be made up of numerous small rooms, identically furnished, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations and could be distinguished one from another only by a surrealist system of digits and letters of the alphabet, and to locate any particular one of these unaided was a considerable enterprise. More than anything else, perhaps, the studio lacked a focus. A decisive single main entrance might have provided this, but in fact there were three main entrances, severely egalitarian in their amenities and with nothing to choose between them except that one of them gave access to the place where you wanted to arrive and the other two did not; and in none of them was there anywhere where enquiries could be made and some species of orientation established. To the mere stranger it was all vastly confusing.
Mere strangers, however, were few and far between; for obvious reasons, the organisation did not encourage their presence. And it was to be presumed that people who worked there could find their way about all right. And by these employees' united labours, romance and adventure would travel the country. Hand in hand, head against shoulder, Jane and George, Sally and Dick would, for three hours at least, snatch immunity, by the studio's contriving, from domestic contention and public strife, from tedium and malice and routine, and the struggle to keep alive.

Film-makers

Almost everybody, it seems, wants to make a movie. Bookshops fill shelves with 'how-to' books about scriptwriting and film production. Fashionable universities offer courses. There are competitions offering the kind of hand-held camera that Robert Rodriguez used to make the film El Mariachi, which cost $7,000 to make and shot him from nowhere into the front line of American independent directors. If ever dreams came true, they did for Rodriguez - and ahead of schedule. Recalling his 23rd birthday in his book about his Mariachi adventures, he writes: ""Orson Welles made Citizen Kane when he was 25. Spielberg made Laws at 26. So I've only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film.'
This was not always so. When the studios ruled, film-makers were expected to take time to mature. They worked behind the scenes, as editors, writers or cinematographers. They learnt the job directing low-budget Westerns or supporting short films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, The Maltese Falcon. Fred Zinnemann, the director of High Noon, only got into his stride in his forties. But nowadays, without the support system of studios or television, aspiring film-makers are forced to be mavericks.",C2,,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

When a book becomes a film, you must make it shorter. You take out many parts. This can be sad for the writer, but it can also help you see the story in a new way. When I wrote a film, I saw I did not need all the words from the book. I could tell the same story. This does not mean the book's words were bad. Books and films are different. They ask you to think in different ways.

Books often say things more than once. For example, they tell you again about a person. They also use words like 'he said'. You often know who is talking, but 'he said' helps you read.

Plays are mostly people talking. The talking in plays is like real talking. Sometimes, in new plays, the talking does not say much. It just shows two people are speaking.

**Watching Movies**

When you watch a film, you can feel you are in its world. For a short time, you forget your real life. It feels like the film world is not real.

But when the film ends and the lights come on, the feeling stops. You are back in your real life. People do not think the time in the cinema is important. When I was a boy, many people did not think films were art. They thought films were only for fun. Our parents and teachers said this. They liked fun, but they did not think films were art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company had many buildings. The place was hard to understand. It had a few important buildings, like the Script Department. But there were also many small rooms. All the rooms looked the same. You could only know them by their numbers and letters. It was hard to find the right room. The studio did not have one main door. It had three main doors. They were all the same. Only one door took you to the right place. There was no place to ask for help. For a new person, it was very confusing.

But not many new people went there. The company did not want new people. The people who worked there knew where to go. These people made stories about love and adventure. Because of their work, people like Jane and George could forget their problems for a few hours.

**Film-makers**

Now, many people want to make a film. Bookshops have many books that teach you how. Many schools have classes about it. Some competitions give you a camera. Robert Rodriguez won a camera. He used it to make his film *El Mariachi*. It did not cost a lot of money, but it made him a famous director. His dream came true. In his book, he wrote about being 23 years old. He said that famous directors made their first big films when they were young. He thought he must make his film soon.

In the past, it was different. Big film companies had the power. New film-makers had to wait and learn. They first had jobs like editors or camera people. They learned by making cheap films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film. Fred Zinnemann became a good director when he was older. But now, there are no big companies to help new film-makers. So people who want to make films must do it alone.","Every Picture Tells a Story

When a book is made into a film, a lot of the story is cut or made shorter. This can be upsetting for the writer, but it can also help them understand their own work. While writing a film script, I noticed that I could remove many conversations and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This doesn't mean the book had too many words. It's because books and films are different. They ask the audience to pay attention in different ways.

In a book, writers often repeat things to help the reader. For example, they might remind you what a character is like, or use words like 'he said'. You might know who is speaking without these words, but they make the book easier to read.

Plays are mostly people talking. The conversations in plays copy real life, where people often say things that aren't very important, just to be friendly. In some modern plays, the characters talk a lot but don't really say anything important.

Watching Movies

When you watch a film, you can feel like you are inside its world. For a short time, you can forget your normal life and your problems. It feels like what happens in the film doesn't really matter.

But when the film ends and the lights come on, you are back in the real world. You don't feel responsible for the time you spent watching the film. In the past, when I was a boy, many people did not think films were art. They thought films were just for fun. Our parents and teachers often said this. They enjoyed being entertained by films, but they didn't think films were a serious art form.

The Film Studios

The Leiper Film Company studios were a group of many different buildings. The layout of the place was confusing and hard to understand. There were a few main buildings you could remember, like the Script Department. But most of the studios were many small rooms that all looked the same. These rooms were used for meetings. The only way to tell them apart was by a strange system of numbers and letters. Finding the right room without help was very difficult. The studio did not have a clear main entrance, which made it worse. There were three main entrances, and they were all the same. Only one would take you to the right place, but there was no one to ask for directions.

Not many visitors came to the studio, and the company did not want them to come. The people who worked there knew how to find their way around. And through the hard work of these employees, stories of romance and adventure were sent to cinemas all over the country. Because of the studio's work, characters like Jane and George or Sally and Dick could, for a few hours, escape from their problems, from boring routines, and from the difficulties of life.

Film-makers

It seems like almost everyone wants to make a film. Bookshops have many books that teach you how to write scripts and make movies. Many universities offer courses on this subject. There are even competitions where you can win a camera like the one Robert Rodriguez used. He made the film *El Mariachi* for only $7,000, and it made him a famous American director. His dream came true. In his book, he remembers that when he was 23, he thought about other famous directors. Orson Welles made *Citizen Kane* when he was 25. Spielberg made *Jaws* at 26. Rodriguez felt he only had a few years to make his own great film.

In the past, it was different. When big studios were in charge, new directors had to wait and learn. They first worked as editors, writers, or camera operators. They learned how to make films by directing cheap westerns or short films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*. Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, only became successful in his forties. But today, without the help of a big studio, people who want to make films have to do it on their own.","Every Picture Tells a Story

When books are turned into films, a lot of the story is usually cut or shortened. This can be upsetting for the writer, but it can also be interesting. While writing a script, I noticed how much of the book's conversation and description I could remove and still keep the same meaning. This doesn't mean the original writing was unnecessary. It's because books and films require different kinds of attention from the audience, and they use repetition in different ways. I don't mean 'repetition' as something useless, but as a technical part of storytelling.

In a book, this repetition includes regularly reminding the reader about a character's main features, or using phrases like 'he said'. A character's trait only needs to be described once, but it helps the reader if it is mentioned again. We can usually understand who is speaking from the words on the page, but 'he said' makes it easier to follow.

Plays, which are mostly dialogue, copy the repetition of real conversation, sometimes in a very artistic way. In some modern plays, the dialogue is almost all repetitive language that just keeps the conversation going, leaving the audience unsure of the real meaning.

Watching Movies

When you watch a film, you can become so involved that you feel you are inside the movie's world. It's an experience that takes you away from your normal life for a few hours. Because of this, it can feel like your feelings and actions in the cinema don't really matter.

But as soon as the film ends and the lights come on, the feeling disappears and you are back in the real world. You don't feel responsible for the time you spent lost in the film. Also, this unreal feeling stops people from taking films seriously. When I was young, many people, including our parents and teachers, did not see films as art. They called them 'just entertainment'. They enjoyed being entertained, but they didn't believe movies were a true art form.

The Film Studios

The Leiper Film Company studios were a group of many different buildings. The layout of the place was confusing and didn't make much sense. There were a few main buildings you could recognise, like the Script Department, but most of the studio was made up of many small, identical rooms. These rooms were used for all kinds of meetings and could only be told apart by a strange system of numbers and letters. Finding a specific room without help was a difficult task. Perhaps the main problem was that the studio had no clear centre. One main entrance could have provided this, but there were actually three entrances. They were all the same, except that only one led to where you needed to go. None of them had an information desk to help visitors get their bearings. For a new visitor, it was very confusing.

However, there were very few visitors because the company did not welcome them. You could assume that the people who worked there knew how to find their way around. And through the hard work of these employees, stories of romance and adventure were sent out across the country. Thanks to the studio's work, characters like Jane and George or Sally and Dick could, for about three hours, escape from their problems, from boredom, and from the difficulties of daily life.

Film-makers

It seems that almost everyone wants to make a film. Bookshops have many instruction books about writing scripts and making movies. Popular universities offer courses on the subject. There are even competitions where you can win the same type of camera that Robert Rodriguez used to make his film *El Mariachi*. That film only cost $7,000 to make and made him a famous American director. If anyone's dreams came true, it was Rodriguez, and it happened faster than he expected. In his book about making *El Mariachi*, he remembers his 23rd birthday and writes: ""Orson Welles made *Citizen Kane* when he was 25. Spielberg made *Jaws* at 26. So I only have two or three years to make my important film.""

This wasn't always the case. When big studios were in control, film-makers were expected to learn slowly. They worked in less important jobs, like editors, writers, or camera operators. They learned how to direct by making cheap Westerns or short films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*. Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, only became successful in his forties. But today, without the support of a big studio or television company, people who want to make films have to be independent and do things their own way.",,
303,"The Wrong Country

Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the fairyland city, in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong.
Either in the travel agency or at the check-in desk, or in some anonymous computer, a small calamity was conceived. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick they had handed their tickets to a girl in the yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She'd addressed them by name, had checked the details on their tickets and said that that was lovely. An hour later it had surprised them to hear elderly people on the plane talking in North of England accents. Keith said there must have been a cancellation, or possibly the Italian class was on a second plane.
They ordered two drinks, and then two more. 'The coach'll take us on,' a stout woman with spectacles announced when they touched down. 'Keep all together now.' There's been no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach drew in at its destination, Keith explained that that was clearly what this was. As they stepped out of the coach it was close on midnight: fatigued and travel-stained, they did not feel like questioning their right to the beds they were offered.
But the next morning, when it became apparent that they were being offered them for the duration of their holiday, they became alarmed.
'We have the lake, and the water birds,' the receptionist smilingly explained. 'And we may take the steamer to Interlaken.'
'An error has been made,' Keith informed the man, keeping the register of his voice even, for it was essential to be calm. He was aware of his wive's agitated breathing close beside him.
'We were meant to be in Venice. In the Pensione Concordia.'
'I do not know the name, sir. This is Switzerland.'
'A coach is to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night, that woman.'
'Your group is booked twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. To make an alteration now, sir, if you have changed your minds -'
'We haven't changed our minds. Theres been a mistake.'
The receptionist shook his head. He did not know about a mistake.
'The man who made the booking,' Dawne interrupted, 'was bald, with glasses and a moustache.' She gave the name of the travel agency in London.
'Some problem, have we?' a woman said, beaming at Keith. She was the stout woman he had referred to as an official. They'd seen her talking to the yellow-and-red girl at Gatwick. On the plane she'd walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people.
'My name is Franks,' she was saying now. 'I'm married to the man with the bad leg.'
'Are you in charge, Mrs Franks?' Dawne enquired. 'Only we're in the wrong hotel.'
Again she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald-headed counter clerk, mentioning his spectacles and his moustache. Keith interrupted her. 'It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it all to her.'
'We should have known when they weren't from Dover,' Dawne contributed. 'We heard them talking about Darlington.'
Keith made an impatient sound. He wished sh'ed leave the talking to him.
'We noticed you at Gatwick,' Keith said. 'We knew you were in charge of things.'
'And I noticed you. I counted you, although I daresay you didn't see me doing that. Now, let me explain to you. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends its clients to, many different holidays at different prices. There are, for instance, villa holidays for the adventurous under-thirty-fives. There are treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas.'
'Now, what I am endeavouring to say to you good people is that all tickets and labels are naturally similar, the yellow with the two red bands.' Mrs Franks suddenly laughed. 'So if you simply followed other people with the yellow-and-red label you might imagine you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course,' she added soothingly, 'that couldn't happen in a million years.'
'We're not meant to be in Switzerland,' Keith doggedly persisted.
'Well, let's just see, shall we?'
Unexpectediy, Mrs Franks turned and went away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer behind the reception desk. The sound of typing could be heard.
'She seems quite kind,' Dawne whispered, 'that woman.' Keith wasn't listening. He tried to go over in his mind every single thing that had occurred: handing the girl the tickets, sitting down to wait, and then the girl leading the way to the plane, and then the pilot's voice welcoming them aboard, and the air hostess with the smooth black hair going round to see that everyone's seat belt was fastened.
'Nice to have some young people along,' an elderly man's voice interrupted Keith's thoughts. 'Nottage the name is.' The old man's wife was with him, both of them looking as if they were in their eighties. They'd slept like logs, she said, best night's sleep they'd had for years, which of course would be due to the lakeside air.
'Thats nice,' Dawne said.
Keith walked out of the reception area and Dawne followed him. On the forecourt of the hotel they didn't say to one another that there was an irony in the catastrophe that had occurred. On their first holiday since their honeymoon they'd landed themselves in a package tour of elderly people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. In his bossy way Uncle had said so himself when they'd tried to persuade him to accompany them.",C2,,"The Wrong Country

Their uncle chose a holiday for them. It was not expensive. They would fly from Gatwick Airport and stay twelve nights in Venice. They would stay at the Pensione Concordia hotel. Keith and Dawne went to the travel shop to book the holiday. The man there said other people on the holiday were a school group. They were learning Italian. But something went wrong.

Maybe at the travel shop, or at the airport, a mistake happened. Dawne and Keith arrived at a different hotel. It was called the Edelweiss. It was in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl. She wore a yellow and red uniform. She said their names and checked their tickets. She said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard old people talking. Keith thought the Italian class was on a different plane.

They had some drinks. When the plane landed, a large woman with glasses said, ""The bus will take us. Stay together."" The holiday paper did not talk about stopping for the night. But when the bus stopped, Keith thought this was the plan. They got off the bus very late. They were very tired and wanted to sleep.

The next morning, they learned they would stay at this hotel for all twelve nights. They were not happy.

""We have a lake and birds here,"" the man at the hotel desk said. ""We can take a boat to Interlaken.""

""There is a mistake,"" Keith told the man. He tried to stay calm. His wife, Dawne, was upset next to him. ""We must be in Venice. At the Pensione Concordia.""

""I do not know that name. This is Switzerland.""

""A bus will take us. A woman on the plane said so. She was here last night.""

""Your group will stay twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you want to change now--""

""We do not want to change. There is a mistake.""

The man at the desk shook his head. He did not know about a mistake.

""The man at the travel shop had no hair. He wore glasses and had a moustache,"" Dawne said. She said the name of the travel shop in London.

""Is there a problem?"" a woman asked. She smiled at Keith. She was the large woman from the plane. They saw her at the airport. On the plane, she walked and smiled at people.

""My name is Mrs. Franks,"" she said. ""My husband has a bad leg.""

""Are you the boss, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are at the wrong hotel.""

Dawne again said the travel shop name and described the man with no hair. Keith spoke. ""I think we went with the wrong group. We gave our tickets to the girl and she did everything.""

""We should have known they were not from Dover,"" Dawne said. ""We heard them say 'Darlington'.""

Keith was not happy. He wanted to talk.

""We saw you at the airport,"" Keith said to Mrs. Franks. ""We knew you were the boss.""

""I saw you, too. I counted you. Now, listen. Your-Kind-of-Holiday has many different trips. They go to many places. For example, young people can stay in villas. People can walk in Turkey. Single people can walk in the Himalayas.""

""I want to say that all the tickets look the same. They are yellow with two red lines."" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""So if you follow other people with a yellow and red ticket, you might think you are going to a zoo! But,"" she said kindly, ""that will never happen.""

""We should not be in Switzerland,"" Keith said again.

""Okay, let's see.""

Suddenly, Mrs. Franks turned and walked away. The man at the desk was gone, too. They heard typing.

""That woman is nice,"" Dawne said quietly. Keith did not listen. He tried to remember everything: giving the girl the tickets, waiting, going to the plane, the pilot's hello, the woman checking seat belts.

""It is good to have young people here,"" an old man said. His name was Mr. Nottage. His wife was with him. They looked very old. She said they slept very well. It was their best sleep for years because of the lake air.

""That's good,"" Dawne said.

Keith walked out of the hotel. Dawne followed. Outside, they did not talk about the big problem. This was their first holiday since their wedding. They wanted to be away from old people. But now they were on a holiday with many old people. Their uncle said this would happen when they asked him to come.","The Wrong Country

Their uncle chose a package holiday for them at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia hotel. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book the holiday, the man at the desk told them that the other people on the same trip were a school group from the south coast. They were all learning Italian. But something went wrong.

Maybe at the travel agency, or at the airport, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She used their names, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with strong English accents. Keith thought maybe there was a change of plan, or that the Italian students were on another plane.

They had some drinks on the plane. When they landed, a large woman with glasses told everyone, ""The bus will take us to the hotel. Please stay together."" The holiday brochure did not say anything about stopping somewhere else overnight, but when the bus arrived at the hotel, Keith thought that must be the plan. They got off the bus almost at midnight. They were very tired and just wanted to sleep.

But the next morning, they understood that they were supposed to stay at this hotel for their whole holiday. They began to worry.

""The hotel has a lake and water birds,"" the man at reception said with a smile. ""We can also take a boat to Interlaken.""

""There has been a mistake,"" Keith told the man. He tried to stay calm, but he could hear his wife breathing quickly next to him. ""We should be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia.""

""I don't know that hotel, sir. This is Switzerland.""

""A woman on the plane said a bus would take us on. She was here last night.""

""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you want to change your plans now, sir—""

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake.""

The man at reception shook his head. He didn't know about a mistake.

""My name is Mrs. Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg.""

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel.""

Again, Dawne described the man at the travel agency and gave the name. Keith interrupted her. ""It seems we joined the wrong group. We gave our tickets to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and trusted her.""

""We should have known something was wrong when we heard them talking about Darlington, not Dover,"" Dawne added.

Keith made an angry sound. He wanted her to let him do the talking.

""We saw you at Gatwick,"" Keith said to Mrs. Franks. ""We knew you were in charge.""

""And I saw you. I counted everyone, but you probably didn't see me. Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many different holidays in many places, at different prices. For example, there are villa holidays for young people under thirty-five. There are walking trips to Turkey and special trips for single people to the Himalayas.""

""What I am trying to say is that all the tickets and labels look the same—yellow with two red lines."" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""So if you just followed other people with the same label, you could think you might end up in a wildlife park! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that would never really happen.""

""We are not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith said again, not giving up.

""Well, let's check, shall we?""

Suddenly, Mrs. Franks turned and walked away, leaving them standing there. The man at reception was also gone. They could hear someone typing.

""That woman seems quite nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn't listening. He tried to remember everything that happened: giving the girl the tickets, waiting, then following her to the plane, the pilot welcoming them, and the flight attendant checking seat belts.

""It's nice to have some young people with us,"" an old man said, interrupting Keith's thoughts. ""My name is Mr. Nottage."" His wife was with him. They both looked about eighty years old. She said they slept very well, the best night's sleep in years, because of the fresh air by the lake.

""That's nice,"" Dawne said.

Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn't talk about the strange problem they had.

This was their first holiday since their honeymoon, and they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people. The whole point of the holiday was to get away from older people and their needs. Their uncle had even said that when they asked him to come with them.","An Administrative Error

Their uncle had selected a package holiday for them at a very competitive rate: a flight from Gatwick Airport and a twelve-night stay in the magical city of Venice, at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne visited the travel agency together to finalise the booking, the clerk informed them that the other participants on that specific package were a school group from the south coast, all of whom were studying Italian. However, a complication arose.

A minor administrative failure occurred, whether at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or within an impersonal computer system. Consequently, Dawne and Keith found themselves in Room 212 of a hotel named the Edelweiss, located in an unspecified part of Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they had presented their tickets to a girl wearing the distinctive yellow-and-red uniform of Your-Kind-of-Holiday. She had personally addressed them, verified the details on their tickets, and expressed her approval. An hour into the flight, they were taken aback to hear elderly passengers conversing in strong northern English accents. Keith speculated that there must have been a last-minute cancellation, or perhaps the Italian class was travelling on a separate flight.

They ordered drinks, and then another round. 'The coach will transport us onwards,' a stout, bespectacled woman announced after they landed. 'Please ensure we all stay together.' The brochure had made no mention of an overnight stop, but when the coach eventually reached its destination, Keith reasoned that this must clearly be the case. They disembarked close to midnight; weary and dishevelled from the journey, they had no inclination to dispute their entitlement to the accommodation offered.

The following morning, however, they became concerned when it became evident that they were expected to remain there for the entire duration of their holiday.

'We have the lake and the waterfowl,' the receptionist explained with a smile. 'We can also take the steamer to Interlaken.'

'An error has been made,' Keith informed the man, deliberately keeping his tone level, as it was crucial to remain composed. He was acutely aware of his wife's agitated breathing beside him. 'We were supposed to be in Venice. At the Pensione Concordia.'

'I am not familiar with that name, sir. This is Switzerland.'

'A coach is supposed to take us on. An official stated so on the plane. That woman was here last night.'

'Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. To make any alterations now, sir, if you have reconsidered—'

'We have not reconsidered. A mistake has occurred.'

The receptionist shook his head, indicating he had no knowledge of any mistake.

'The man who made the booking,' Dawne interjected, 'was bald, wore glasses, and had a moustache.' She provided the name of the London travel agency.

'Are we experiencing some difficulty?' a woman inquired, beaming at Keith. She was the stout woman he had identified as an official. They had observed her speaking with the yellow-and-red-clad girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she had patrolled the aisle, smiling at the passengers.

'My name is Franks,' she announced. 'I'm married to the gentleman with the bad leg.'

'Are you in charge, Mrs Franks?' Dawne asked. 'It's just that we appear to be in the wrong hotel.'

Once again, she named the travel agency and described the bald counter clerk, noting his spectacles and moustache. Keith interrupted her. 'It seems we joined the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday representative and left all the arrangements to her.'

'We should have realised when they weren't from Dover,' Dawne added. 'We overheard them discussing Darlington.'

Keith made a sound of impatience. He wished she would let him do the talking.

'We noticed you at Gatwick,' Keith said. 'We understood you were in charge of the arrangements.'

'And I noticed you. I did a headcount, though I expect you didn't see me doing so. Now, allow me to explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers a wide variety of destinations and holidays at different price points. For instance, there are villa holidays for adventurous travellers under thirty-five. There are treks in Turkey and singles' treks to the Himalayas.'

'What I am trying to convey to you both is that all the tickets and labels are naturally very similar, yellow with two red bands.' Mrs Franks suddenly laughed. 'So if you simply followed other people who also had the yellow-and-red label, you could theoretically imagine ending up on a wildlife safari! But of course,' she added in a placating tone, 'the likelihood of that is virtually nonexistent.'

'We are not supposed to be in Switzerland,' Keith insisted doggedly.

'Well, let's just look into this, shall we?'

Unexpectedly, Mrs Franks turned and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist had also vanished from behind the desk. The sound of typing could be heard from a nearby office.

'She seems quite pleasant, that woman,' Dawne whispered. Keith wasn't listening. He was mentally retracing every step: handing the tickets to the girl, waiting in the lounge, the girl then leading the way to the aircraft, the pilot's voice welcoming them aboard, and the stewardess with the sleek black hair ensuring all seatbelts were fastened.

'It's lovely to have some young people with us,' an elderly man's voice interrupted Keith's thoughts. 'The name is Nottage.' The old man's wife stood with him; both appeared to be in their eighties. They had slept extremely well, she remarked, the best night's sleep they'd had in years, which she attributed to the fresh lakeside air.

'That's nice,' Dawne replied.

Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed. On the hotel forecourt, they did not articulate the irony of their predicament. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had inadvertently joined a package tour predominantly comprising elderly people, when the entire purpose of the holiday had been to escape the demands associated with the elderly. Their uncle, in his typically domineering manner, had explicitly stated as much when they had attempted to persuade him to join them.",

American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America, however, has only just discovered him - although the Wall Street Journal's description of Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose beats went all but unnoticed for most of the 20th century' is taking things too far. But now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are in production and are expected to spring off the shells as fast as they are stacked; the American Museum of Natural History is mounting a grand exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is preparing a film based on Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as icon and exemplar. His sell-appointed apostles recount the details of his deeds with awe; they extract lessons in leadership and communications as parables for spin doctors, and insiders refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined, resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, took Shackleton for a role model years ago. His firm specialises in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises'. Such as? Such as 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go'. While not forgetting that Shackleton served time in public relations for a Glasgow steel works, it may be a trifle difficult to spot instantly the relevance of eking out the last bit of albatross in sub-zero temperatures to putting a spin on a derivatives trading disaster for the Internet.
'Even if a company manages its crises beautifully, it can still do a lot of harm by communicating sadly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. he was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose -- such as their lives. In some ways the most fascinating decision Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That trip explained his credibility for the next one: the lives of his men were paramount.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their objective, with unforeseen delays draining their supplies and limited time to get back to their ship, Shackleton made the courageous and difficult decision to turn hack.
In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Whereas now the tendency is for managers to duck and squirm, Shackleton was prepared to stand up and accept responsibility. His 1914 expedition was the one that became the stuff of legend. His ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in the pack ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it finally went down, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries the then kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men continually informed and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling thry're being criticised.'
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating, especially in America, a culture that is fanatically opposed to letting time sort things out,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell up would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product's a stinker, don't keep selling it.'
Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expeditions: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavour is increasing. Shackleton exposes the fact that there is nothing heroic going on now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the genuine embodiment of the ideals that we are so wistful for nowadays.'
",C2,,"American business leaders now like Ernest Shackleton. They think he was a good boss. Eluned Price writes about this.

People in Britain know about Sir Ernest Shackleton. They know what he did. Americans are learning about him now. They are very interested. Books about his trip on the ship Endurance are being written. People will buy them fast. A big museum in America will have a show about him. A film company will make a movie about his life.

Some American managers think Shackleton is a great example. They talk about his life with respect. They learn about being a good leader from his story. They learn about how to talk to people. Shackleton was strong and smart. He had a warm sleeping bag. Business advisers today want to be like him.

Jim MacGregor is a manager in New York. He liked Shackleton for many years. His company helps other companies. They help them talk to people when there is a big problem. For example, if a factory has a fire. Or if many people lose their jobs. It is not easy to see how surviving in the cold is like a business problem today.

MacGregor says, ""A company can handle a problem well. But if it does not talk about it well, it can still cause harm. Shackleton was a good leader. He knew how to talk to people. He knew what was important. He was best when he and his men could lose everything, even their lives. One important choice was on his 1908 trip. He was only 97 miles from the South Pole. But he turned back. This showed his men's lives were most important."" They had little food. They had little time. It was a brave choice.

In a problem, people want a leader. Today, bosses sometimes hide. Shackleton did not hide. He took responsibility. His 1914 trip made him famous. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months. Then the ice broke the ship. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We will be safe if you try your best and trust me."" The men wrote in their diaries. They said Shackleton was always the boss. ""Shackleton thought about everything,"" says MacGregor. ""He made plans for all problems. He told his men what was happening. He asked for their ideas. He could change his plans. We use his story to show good rules for business. Our clients understand his story. They do not feel bad.""

Shackleton said an explorer must be positive, strong, and patient. ""It is hard to wait in a bad situation,"" says MacGregor. ""In America, people do not like to wait. If you make a bad choice with money, sometimes you must wait to get it back. If you sell fast, you lose money. Also, change your plans if they are not working. If a new product is bad, stop selling it.""

Shackleton showed people what to do. On a boat trip, he saw the photographer had no gloves. Shackleton gave the man his own gloves. He said he would throw them in the water if the man did not wear them. Another time, they had very little food. He did the same with a biscuit. He said he would leave it in the snow. You could not buy that biscuit for any money. Caroline Alexander wrote a book about the trip. She says, ""People want to hear about heroes more now. Shackleton shows we do not have many heroes today. He is a real example of the good things we want now.""","He was a person who was good with people.

American business leaders are now looking to the explorer Ernest Shackleton as an example of a good manager. Eluned Price writes about this.

Many people in Britain know about Sir Ernest Shackleton and what he did. In America, people have only recently learned about him. The Wall Street Journal wrote about him earlier this year, calling him an Antarctic explorer who was not very famous for most of the 1900s. Now, Americans are very interested in him. Books about his life and his ship, the Endurance, are being written and will sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big show about him, and a film company is making a movie of his life.

Some American managers also see Shackleton as a hero and a model. His fans talk about his actions with great respect. They find lessons about leadership and communication in his story. They even use the phrase ""speaking Shackleton"" with each other. Shackleton, who was determined and good at solving problems, is now an example for modern business advisors.

Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has seen Shackleton as a role model for years. His company helps other companies communicate during big changes or problems. For example, when a factory has an accident or many people lose their jobs. It might be hard to see the connection between Shackleton's difficult journey and modern business problems. But MacGregor says Shackleton is a good model because of his leadership and communication skills. He knew what was important. He was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, even their lives. One of his most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This showed that his team's lives were the most important thing. This happened during his 1908 trip.

In a crisis, MacGregor says, people want to know that someone is in control. Today, managers often try to avoid problems, but Shackleton was ready to take responsibility. His 1914 trip made him famous. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and was finally destroyed by the ice. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men they would all be safe if they did their best and trusted him. From the diaries written at the time, it is clear that Shackleton was always the leader. MacGregor says, ""Shackleton thought about everything, planned for all possibilities, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was able to change his plans when things went wrong and start again. We have built a set of rules here that Shackleton shows us. Our clients understand his story without feeling they are being judged.""

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs to be positive, strong, and patient. ""One of the hardest things to do in a difficult situation is to wait, especially in America, where people don't like to wait for things to get better,"" says MacGregor. ""If you buy bonds and the interest rates change, you should wait and you will get your money back. If you sell quickly, you will lose a lot of money. Also, don't be afraid to change your plans if they are not working. If a new product is not good, stop selling it.""

Shackleton led by example. On the trip back from the Endurance, he saw that Hurley, the trip's photographer, had no gloves. Shackleton made Hurley take his own gloves, saying he would throw them away if Hurley didn't wear them. Another person remembered that on a different trip in 1905, when they were very hungry, Shackleton did the same with a biscuit. He said he would leave it in the snow. That biscuit was worth more than money. As Caroline Alexander, who wrote the book *Endurance*, says: ""People are more interested in stories about heroes now. Shackleton shows us that we don't have many heroes today. He stands out as a true example of the values we miss now.""","He was a person who worked well with others.

American business leaders are now looking to the explorer Ernest Shackleton as an example of good leadership. Eluned Price writes about this.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. America, however, has only just learned about him. Now, Americans are becoming very interested in him. New books about his journey on the ship Endurance are being published and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is preparing a large exhibition, and a film company is making a movie about his life.

Some American managers also see Shackleton as a role model. His supporters talk about his actions with great respect. They find lessons about leadership and communication in his story, and some even use phrases from his life in their work. The strong and capable Shackleton, with his fur sleeping bag and stove for cooking, has become an example for modern business advisors.

Jim MacGregor, a senior partner at a New York firm, chose Shackleton as his role model years ago. His company focuses on communication during company mergers, takeovers, and crises. For example, what to do if a factory explodes or many jobs must be cut. It might seem strange to connect surviving in freezing conditions with managing a modern business crisis, but MacGregor sees the link.

""Even if a company handles a crisis well, it can still cause damage by communicating poorly,"" says MacGregor. ""Shackleton is a model because of his leadership and communication skills. He knew what was important. He was at his best when he and his team had everything to lose – even their lives. One of his most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This showed that his team's safety was his main concern."" This refers to his 1908 expedition when, running out of supplies, he made the brave choice to return.

In a crisis, MacGregor says, people need to know that someone is in control. While managers today often try to avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to stand up and take charge. His 1914 expedition is the one that made him famous. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and was finally destroyed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men they would all be safe as long as they did their best and trusted him. From the diaries written at the time, it is clear that 'the Boss' was always in control.

""Shackleton thought about everything, planned for all possibilities, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible. If something was lost, he was willing to accept it and start again. We have developed a set of effective principles that Shackleton's story shows. Clients can understand his story without feeling they are being judged.""

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical strength, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in a difficult situation is to wait, especially in America, where people don't like to let time solve problems,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and the interest rates are wrong, you wait and you will eventually get your money back. To 'fix it' by selling would mean a big loss. Also, don't be afraid to change your plans if they aren't working. If a new product is bad, stop selling it.""

Shackleton led by example. On the journey back from the Endurance, he saw that Hurley, the photographer, had no gloves. He made Hurley take his own gloves, saying he would throw them away if Hurley didn't wear them. Another person remembered him doing the same with a biscuit when they were nearly starving on an earlier trip. He said he would leave it in the snow. No amount of money could have bought that biscuit.

As Caroline Alexander, the author of a book about the expedition, says: ""People are more and more interested in stories of great effort. Shackleton's story shows that we don't see this kind of heroism today. When you look past everything else, he remains as a true example of the values we miss today.""","American executives are increasingly looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for effective leadership. Eluned Price reports.

While most people in Britain are familiar with Sir Ernest Shackleton and his achievements, he has only recently gained recognition in the United States. The Wall Street Journal’s earlier description of him as “an Antarctic explorer whose accomplishments went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century” may be somewhat exaggerated. Nevertheless, Americans are now embracing his story with considerable enthusiasm. Biographies and chronicles of the Endurance expedition are in production and are expected to sell rapidly. The American Museum of Natural History is organising a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is producing a film based on his life.

Shackleton has also been adopted as an icon and role model by some American managers. His self-appointed advocates recount his exploits with admiration, drawing leadership and communication lessons as instructive examples for public relations specialists. Insiders even refer to “speaking Shackleton.” The determined and resourceful explorer, equipped with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber stove, has become a symbol for contemporary management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has regarded Shackleton as a role model for years. His firm specialises in communications related to mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises—such as a factory explosion or large-scale redundancies. Although Shackleton once worked in public relations for a Glasgow steelworks, the connection between surviving in sub-zero temperatures and managing a modern financial crisis may not be immediately obvious.

“Even if a company handles a crisis effectively, poor communication about its actions can still cause significant damage,” MacGregor explains. “Shackleton exemplifies leadership and communication. He prioritised his values and performed best when he and his team had everything to lose—including their lives. One of his most remarkable decisions was to turn back just 97 miles from the South Pole. That choice reinforced his credibility for future expeditions: the safety of his men was his foremost concern.” This refers to his 1908 expedition, when dwindling supplies and limited time forced him to make that difficult decision.

During a crisis, MacGregor notes, people need to know that someone is in control. While contemporary managers often avoid responsibility, Shackleton was prepared to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary. After his ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in pack ice and was eventually crushed, Shackleton assured his crew, “We will all reach safety as long as you do your best and trust me.” Diaries and accounts from the time confirm that he remained in command throughout. “Shackleton thought through every detail, planned for all possibilities, kept his men informed, and sought their opinions,” says MacGregor. “He was adaptable, ready to abandon what was lost and start again. We have developed a set of effective principles that Shackleton embodies. Clients can connect with his story without feeling criticised.”

Shackleton believed that an explorer required optimism, physical endurance, and patience. “One of the most challenging things in a crisis is waiting, especially in America, where the culture strongly resists letting time resolve issues,” MacGregor observes. “If you invest in bonds and interest rates move against you, holding on will eventually recover your money. Selling in a panic would mean a major loss. Similarly, don’t hesitate to change direction if a plan isn’t working. If a new product fails, stop selling it.”

Shackleton led by personal example. During the return from the Endurance expedition, he noticed the photographer, Hurley, had no gloves. Shackleton insisted Hurley take his own, threatening to throw them overboard if he refused. Another account from the 1905 expedition recalls him doing the same with a biscuit when the team was near starvation: “He said he would leave it in the snow. No amount of money could have bought that biscuit.” As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, remarks: “Public interest in heroic endeavours is growing. Shackleton’s story highlights the absence of such heroism today. When everything else is stripped away, he remains the genuine embodiment of the ideals we now long for.”",
305,"Fashion

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out, though, that fashion, at least in the sense of style and design, has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point.
As societies have developed in complexity, populations have expanded, and multiple technologies for producing an increasing variety of clothing and physical adornment have been discovered, so the meanings attached to dress have also increased in their complexity and significance. Consequently, it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty today what any item of clothing or adornment actually means. For example, a man's suit, supposedly an indicator of the most extreme uniformity, actually conveys very differing meanings in different contexts and to different people.

Newspaper reports of publishers in bidding wars over whizz-kid manuscripts have resulted in a skewed idea of what life is like for your average novelist. Down at my end of the business - i.e. not exactly topping the best-seller lists - there are two ways of making ends meet. The wisest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if the book doesn't immediately get snapped up and turned into a film. Those such as myself, however, are literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a bit of teaching, the occasional workshop and articles like this. I have heard tell of an in-house writing opportunity offered by a chocolate factory, but I've never managed to get anything like that. Somehow, though, by dint of juggling part-time jobs and credit cards and also, more often than not, thanks to the generosity of those names you find in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

Sudden Fame

The small venues we were performing at around the country were all beginning to sell out and extra bouncers were having to be called in to hold back the growing legion of screaming girls. We found ourselves having to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms we were playing to prevent ourselves being mobbed by fans. On the few nights a week when we were not working, we found it difficult to leave the house without being pursued through the streets by adoring followers. In a matter of days, we had been transformed into celebrities. Our moves were monitored by our admirers and all of our needs catered for by our management and other interested parties. Even though the shyness that had always accompanied me never quite went away, it was replaced by a strange naive over-confidence that only naturally shy people who have been thrust into similar situations can relate to. In short, I was emotionally totally out of my depth.",C2,,"**Fashion**

People think fashion is new, but it is not. Fashion has a long history. In the past, people also cared about style and clothes.

Today, we have many kinds of clothes. It is hard to know what a piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit looks the same, but it can mean different things to different people.

Many people think writers are rich and famous. But for most writers, life is not like that. There are two ways to make money.

Some writers have a full-time job and write in their free time. This is a safe way. Other writers, like me, do different small jobs. We teach a little, give workshops, or write articles. It is not easy. Sometimes we use credit cards or get help from friends. But in the end, we finish our books.

**Sudden Fame**

We started playing music in small places. Soon, all the tickets were sold. Many girls came to see us and screamed. We had to use secret doors to get inside.

When we were not working, it was hard to go out. People followed us in the street. We became famous very quickly. Our fans watched everything we did. Other people helped us with our needs.

I was always a shy person. I am still shy, but now I also feel too confident. Only shy people who become famous understand this feeling. I did not know how to act.","**Fashion**

Many people think fashion is a modern idea that only grew because of business in the 19th and 20th centuries. But fashion historians say that style and design have a much longer history. They often say it started when trade and markets grew in the 16th and 17th centuries.

As societies became bigger and more complex, and as new ways to make clothes and accessories were found, the meaning of what we wear also became more complex and important. Because of this, it is now hard to know exactly what a piece of clothing or an accessory means. For example, a man's suit might seem the same everywhere, but it can mean very different things to different people in different places.

Newspaper stories about publishers fighting to buy a young writer's book can give the wrong idea about a normal novelist's life. For most writers like me, who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to earn enough money. The smartest writers have a full-time job and write in their free time. That way, they still have money even if their book isn't sold for a film. Others, like me, do different small jobs to survive. We might do a little teaching, run a workshop, or write articles like this one. I've heard about jobs writing for companies, like a chocolate factory, but I've never been able to get one. Still, by working different part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often with the help of generous people we thank in our books, we manage to finish writing our novels.

Newspaper stories about publishers fighting over manuscripts by young, successful authors have created a misleading impression of the average novelist’s life. In my part of the industry—meaning nowhere near the bestseller lists—there are basically two ways to earn a living.

306,"Language

You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability, we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth, they will soon be exchanging words. When there is no one to talk with, people talk to themselves, to their dogs, even to their plants. I like to describe the skill of language as an 'instinct'. This conveys the idea that people know how to talk in more or less the sense that spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not invented by some unsung spider genius, and does not depend on having had the right education or on having an aptitude for architecture or the construction trades.

Climate and Weather

Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, profoundly affect the lives and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can be a dominating force on the character of landscapes. For example, warmth and wetness all the year round allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are natural treasure troves, with an incredible diversity of species. Conversely cold, windswept areas can muster only a scattered selection of living things. The daily weather patterns that add up in the long term to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing, for the atmosphere is never still. Some of the motion is due to the fact that the envelope of gases rests on a spinning globe, because air is thin it is not dragged along at the same speed as the earth, but tends to lag behind. A more important source of turbulence, or air movement, however, is the sun.

Coffee

My duties as bar-person included serving drinks but, more worryingly, I was to be responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant can stand or fall on its coffee reputation. There followed several days of intensive coffee-making training, in which I took in more than I could ever wish to know about the cleaning and maintenance of the restaurants gleaming espresso machine. I learnt, too, about the essential principles involved in making the perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week I had to admit that making a decent cup of coffee was not as easy as it looked and I fully expected to be banished to lowly ash-tray wiping duties again. Luckily, my boss was a patient man. 'Making coffee is both an art and a science,' he said, 'and you need time to acquire the knack.'",C2,,,"Language

You and I are part of a special group of living things. We can share ideas with each other very clearly. Language is so much a part of being human that it's hard to think about life without it. If you see two or more people anywhere in the world, they will probably start speaking. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as a natural ability, like a spider's skill at making webs. No spider had to learn how to make a web, and it doesn't need to study building or design.

Climate and Weather

The air around us creates climate and weather. These affect where animals and plants can live and how they live. Climate can decide what a place looks like. For example, hot and wet weather all year helps tropical forests grow. These forests are full of many different kinds of life. On the other hand, cold and windy places have only a few types of living things. Weather is the day-to-day changes, and over time this makes the climate. The air is always moving. Some movement happens because the Earth is spinning. The air moves slower than the Earth because it is light. But the sun is the main reason why air moves around.

Coffee

My job as a bar person was to serve drinks. But I was most worried about making coffee. In Melbourne's Lygon Street, a restaurant's success can depend on how good its coffee is. I had several days of hard training to learn how to make coffee. I learned more than I wanted to know about cleaning and looking after the restaurant's shiny coffee machine. I also learned the basic rules for making a perfect cup of cappuccino with lots of foam. After the first week, I understood that making good coffee was more difficult than it seemed. I thought I would have to go back to just cleaning ashtrays. But my boss was a kind person. He told me, ""Making coffee is like art and science together. You need time to learn how to do it well.""","Language

Humans have an amazing ability: we can communicate ideas to each other with great accuracy. Language is such a normal part of being human that it's hard to think about life without it. If you see two or more people anywhere in the world, they will probably be speaking. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people naturally know how to speak, just as spiders naturally know how to build webs. No single spider invented web-building, and it doesn't require special training or skill in design.

Climate and Weather

The air around us creates climate and weather, which have a huge effect on where animals and plants can live. Climate is a powerful influence on how a landscape looks. For instance, constant warmth and rain allow tropical jungles to grow. These jungles are like natural treasure chests, full of many different kinds of life. On the other hand, cold and windy places support only a few types of living things. The daily weather, which over time makes up the climate, is caused by large bodies of air moving and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Part of this movement happens because the Earth is spinning. The air, which is light, doesn't spin at the same speed as the planet and tends to fall behind. However, the sun is a more important reason for this air movement.

Coffee

My job as a bartender included serving drinks, but what worried me more was that I also had to make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on how good its coffee is. I then had several days of intense training on how to make coffee. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and looking after the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the basic rules for making a perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I had to accept that making a good coffee was harder than it seemed. I was sure I would be sent back to the simple job of cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was a patient man. 'Making coffee is both an art and a science,' he told me, 'and it takes time to learn how to do it well.'",,

Rejoice -- the well-nigh impossible has happened: London's austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not, thankfully, by some huge-budget, mega-hyped, multi-media extravaganza, but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art -- that is art which is concerned with movement -- in the twentieth century. In the process, it reveals that making artworks which either move by themselves or investigate the idea of movement in some way has been a consistent if largely unrecognised theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. And not only that -- the marvellous range of paintings and drawings, documents and films on kinetic art assembled by curator Guy Brett, who has made a life-long study of the subject, are presented largely unmediated by text. Visitors, unharried by explanations, are left to have the pleasure of making connections and discoveries for themselves.

David Hockney

Hockney's work appeals to a great many people who might otherwise display little interest in art. It may be that they are attracted to it because it is figurative and, therefore, easily accessible on one level, or because the subject matter of leisure and exorcism provides an escape from the mundanities of everyday life. Perhaps it is not even the art that interests some people, but Hockney's engaging personality and the verbal wit that makes him such good copy for the newspapers. He may, in other words, be popular for the wrong reasons. But does this negate the possibility that his art has a serious sense of purpose?
In the view of some respected critics, Hockney is nothing more than an overrated minor artist. To this one can counter that Hockney might seem minor because it is unacceptable today to be so popular, rather than because his work is lacking in substance. Hockney himself is not self-deluding; he is aware of his limitations and thinks that it is beside the point to dismiss his work because it does not measure up to an abstract concept of greatness. Hockney does not claim to be a great artist and is aware that only posterity can form a final judgement on his stature.

Window-shopping - an art exhibition

In the last few years I have seen loads of exhibitions of contemporary art, and amongst them brilliance and mediocrity. What always bugs me, though, are shows that seem to push an underlying agenda, suggesting there is a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes it works, we really are made aware of new trends mining though apparently unrelated work. More often, though, we are alerted to a dubious angle or a forced concept. This led me, as a curator, to attempt a show which stands as an antithesis to this.
Together with seven artists I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was intended as a collection of individual artworks that related to each other purely through the fact that they proclaimed to be art. Sam Cole's knitted cats went barmy chasing each other round on a toy train track. In contrast Matthew Crawley's turning on a video camera, opening it up and poking around in there until it breaks flickered, flashed and disappeared on the monitor in the corner. These works certainly didn't fit into the 'an exhibition exploring the theme of ...' category, and wouldn't usually be seen together in the same show, but why not? They did not impede each other and actually, I hope, through their contrast, gave something to each other. OK, so I haven't made any grandiose statements about the nature of contemporary art practice, but there probably aren't any to be made about what is basically an individual activity in which artists set their own parameters.

Art History

People who enjoy paintings are sometimes reluctant to analyse them for fear of spoiling the richness and spontaneity of their experience. It has been suggested that some of the work done by art historians, whose concern is with theory rather than practice, ignores and indeed denies the aesthetic experience, the fundamental pleasure of looking, as well as the very special act of artistic creativity. This view is a bit like the notion that knowing the ingredients of the recipe, recognising the method of cooking and seeing the utensils employed detracts from the taste of the dish.
Acknowledging the importance of enjoying something does not, of course, preclude a thorough knowledge of the object that is arousing pleasure. It might in fact be more pleasurable if we know more about the object we are viewing. Moreover, pleasure is not a simple matter. The arousal of our senses - and how we recognise and register it - is itself open to interrogation. It is also historically located. Why we like particular characteristics of certain sorts of objects at any one time is not simply the result of our genes or our own particular personalities but is determined by values promoted within the society of which we are a part. So, while no one seeks to underestimate the importance of sensuous and instinctive responses to art objects, the notion that the sensuous is undermined by the intellectual is a legacy from a period in the past which promoted art as an alternative to thought.",C2,,"**Kinetic Art**

Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London is now a wonderful place to visit. A new show looks at art from the last 60 years. It is about kinetic art. This is art that moves. The show tells us that making art that moves is an old idea. A man named Guy Brett put the show together. He collected many paintings, drawings, and films. There is not much writing to read. People who visit can have fun looking and learning on their own.

**David Hockney**

Many people like David Hockney's art. Even people who do not usually like art like his work. Maybe they like it because it shows things they know. Or maybe they like the pictures of people having fun. Some people might like Hockney because he is a friendly and funny man. So, maybe people like him for simple reasons. But is his art still good?
Some art experts say Hockney is not a very important artist. But other people say he is popular, so he is important. Hockney knows his art is not perfect. He does not say he is a great artist. He thinks only people in the future can decide if his art is important.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

I have seen many new art shows. Some were very good. Some were not good. I do not like shows where all the art has to be the same. Sometimes this is okay. But often, it is not a good idea. So, I wanted to make a different kind of show.
I worked with seven artists in a big empty room. The show was called 'Window-shopping'. It had many different kinds of art. The only thing the same was that they were all art. One artist made small cats from wool. They ran on a toy train. Another artist made a video of a broken camera. The picture moved and then stopped. These artworks were not the same. They are not usually in a show together. But that is okay. They were all good next to each other. I am not saying something big about art. Art is something each artist does in their own way.

**Art History**

People who like paintings sometimes do not want to learn about them. They think learning will make looking less fun. Some people think art experts forget that looking at art should be enjoyable. They think it is like knowing how food is made. If you know, is the food less tasty?
It is important to enjoy art. But learning about art can make it more fun to look at. Also, what we like is not simple. Why we like some art is because of the world we live in. It is not just about us. So, feeling happy about art is important. But thinking about art does not take away that happy feeling. The old idea that you cannot feel and think about art is wrong.","**Kinetic Art**

Great news! Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. This usually serious gallery is now full of wonderful things. The change didn't come from a big, expensive show. It came from a special look at an art style from the last 60 years that many people have forgotten. A new exhibition shows the history of kinetic art. This is art that moves. The exhibition shows that for a long time, artists have made art that moves or is about movement. This has been an important idea in modern art, even if not many people knew about it. The show has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Expert Guy Brett chose them all. There is very little text explaining the art. This means visitors can have fun finding their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

Many people who don't usually like art enjoy Hockney's work. Maybe they like it because it shows real things, so it is easy to understand. Or maybe they like the pictures of free time and happy places, which feel like an escape from normal life. For some people, it might not be the art they like, but Hockney's friendly personality and clever talking. This makes newspapers want to write about him. So, he might be famous for reasons that have nothing to do with his art. But does this mean his art is not serious?
Some important critics think Hockney is not a very important artist. But another way to see it is this: Hockney might seem unimportant only because he is very popular, not because his work is bad. Hockney knows his own limits. He thinks it is wrong to say his art is bad just because it isn't ""great"" in a special way. Hockney does not say he is a great artist. He knows that only people in the future can decide how important his art really is.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

In the last few years, I have seen many modern art shows. Some were very good, and some were not so good. But what I don't like are shows that try to say all the artists think the same way. Sometimes this works, and we see new trends in art. But usually, the idea feels strange and unnatural. This made me, as a curator, want to make a show that was the complete opposite.
I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. The show was called 'Window-shopping'. It was a group of different artworks. The only thing connecting them was that they were all called art. For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that ran wildly on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley made a video of himself breaking a camera. The video flickered and then went away on a screen. These works did not fit together under one theme. You would not normally see them in the same show. But why not? They didn't bother each other. In fact, I think because they were so different, they made each other more interesting. I didn't make any big claims about what modern art is. But maybe there are no big claims to make. Art is something personal, and each artist makes their own rules.

**Art History**

People who love paintings sometimes don't want to study them. They worry it will ruin the fun and natural feeling of looking at art. Some people think that art historians, who study ideas about art, forget the simple joy of looking and the special act of creating. This is like thinking that knowing what is in your food and how it is cooked makes it taste worse.
Of course, enjoying something is very important. But you can also learn about it. In fact, knowing more about a painting might make you enjoy it more. Also, pleasure is not simple. How we feel when we see art is something we can think about. It also changes with time. Why we like certain art is not just because of who we are. It is also because of the ideas that are popular in our society. So, while our first feelings about art are important, the idea that thinking ruins feeling is old. It comes from a time when people thought art and thinking were separate.","**Kinetic Art**

It's wonderful news – something almost impossible has happened. London's serious Hayward Gallery has become a place full of surprise. Thankfully, this wasn't done with an expensive, heavily advertised show, but with a unique look at a mostly forgotten part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition follows the history of kinetic art – art that involves movement – in the twentieth century. It shows that creating art which moves or explores the idea of movement has been a continuous, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting art of our time. Also, the amazing collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, put together by expert Guy Brett, is shown with very little text. Visitors, free from long explanations, can enjoy making their own connections and discoveries.

**David Hockney**

Hockney's work is liked by many people who are not usually interested in art. Maybe they are drawn to it because it shows real things and is easy to understand on a basic level. Or perhaps they like the subjects of free time and happiness, which offer an escape from normal daily life. For some, it might not even be the art itself but Hockney's friendly personality and clever way of speaking that make him popular in the news. In other words, he might be famous for the wrong reasons. But does this mean his art has no serious purpose?
Some important critics think Hockney is just a minor artist who gets too much praise. However, one could argue that Hockney seems minor only because being very popular is sometimes looked down upon today, not because his work has no value. Hockney is realistic; he knows his limits and believes it is wrong to reject his work because it doesn't match an ideal of 'great' art. He does not say he is a great artist and understands that only the future can decide his true importance.

**Window-shopping - an art exhibition**

In recent years, I have seen many exhibitions of modern art, including both excellent and average work. What always bothers me, however, are shows that seem to have a hidden message, suggesting all the artists share the same opinion. Sometimes this works, and we notice new trends in seemingly different works. More often, we sense a questionable idea or a forced concept. This inspired me, as a curator, to try an exhibition that is the complete opposite.
With seven artists, I used a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a group of individual artworks connected only by the fact that they were called art. Sam Cole's knitted cats went crazy chasing each other on a toy train track. In contrast, Matthew Crawley's work involved turning on a video camera, opening it, and touching its parts until it broke, causing the screen to flicker and then go black. These works definitely didn't fit the 'exhibition about a theme' category and wouldn't normally be shown together, but why not? They didn't get in each other's way and, I hope, actually gave something to each other through their differences. Okay, I haven't made any big claims about modern art, but there probably aren't any to make about what is basically a personal activity where artists follow their own rules.

**Art History**

People who like paintings sometimes avoid analysing them because they worry it will ruin the direct and rich experience. Some believe that art historians, who focus on ideas rather than making art, ignore and even reject the simple pleasure of looking and the special nature of creating art. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe's ingredients, the cooking method, and the tools used makes the food taste worse.
Of course, recognising the importance of enjoying something doesn't mean you can't also learn about it thoroughly. In fact, knowing more about what you are looking at might make it more enjoyable. Also, pleasure is not simple. How our senses are stimulated – and how we notice and understand this – is something we can question. Our tastes are also shaped by the time we live in. Why we prefer certain features in objects at a particular time isn't just because of our genes or personality, but is influenced by the values of our society. So, while no one wants to ignore the importance of instinctive and emotional reactions to art, the idea that thinking somehow damages feeling is an old-fashioned view from a time when art was seen as separate from thought.","Kinetic Art

308,"REMOVAL DAY

With her children now grown, widowed Susan faces leaving the family home.

The van said, Susan noticed, 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man, his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables, and his team of helpers, not so gentle.
It was a lovely house that she was leaving, an elegant four-storeyed building overlooking a tiny harbour. The years she had spent there, the years of the children growing up and leaving, hung around in the air, faintly present like agitated dust. 
When told that they had bought this house, Robert, then five, had asked thoughtfully, 'Mum, when you buy a house, how d'you get it home?' You could miss a little boy in the physical presence of the adult he had become; Robert was here, helping, and in particular making sure she didn't let on about the piano. Francesca was here too, also helping, in her bossy way, stubbornly certain that nobody but she, the family daughter, would be careful enough over a fine instrument like a Steinway piano.
'She doesn't look like she's going to cry on us,' observed Fred. 'That's something.' 'Do people cry?' Susan asked, intrigued. 'You'd be surprised,' said Fred. 'They go around merry as magpies helping out till its all in the van, then you look round and there they are, crying in the middle of an empty room. They're fine when we get to the new place, mind. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.'
She could easily imagine.
Left to herself, Susan would have warned the removers about the piano before accepting the estimate. Robert had said sternly that it was their business to see the problem, and their bad luck if they didn't. The piano now stood in solitary glory in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would leave it till last, naturally. Sitting on the bottom stair, for all the chairs were gone now, she remembered the time they had arrived.
The day she was living through now was like that day filmed and run backwards - the piano had been carried in first. And it had got stuck on the stairs. For nearly two hours the team of removal men struggled manfully with it, until it seemed they would simply have to give up.
They brought it up to the turn of the stairs, and down again, and cut out banister rails, and got it jammed anyway, while little Robert looked on enthralled, and young Francesca wailed, 'We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't! I'd rather die!' And of course they couldn't, not with a musical daughter destined to be a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it in, and a way had been found.
Peter, her late husband, had come home to the crisis and had resolved it. The piano had been left in the garden while the other furniture was brought in - there was much less of it then, they had been relatively young and hard up. And next day, to everyone's surprise, a builder had been engaged to take out the first floor window.
Then, from the quay below the house, where fish were unloaded from the inshore boats, a little crane was borrowed, and dragged up the hill by means of the local farmer's tractor. Finally, the piano was wrapped in blankets, hooked to the crane and gently swung safely through the gaping window, while the entranced children danced with joy at the sight of it.
However, the whole process had cost so much it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned. 'That's that,' Peter had said. 'That's there for ever.' But for ever is a long time.
The children were increasingly too busy to come home at weekends, and Susan was no longer so mobile in the house, and puffing as she climbed the stairs. The thought of the stairs interrupted her daydream. The banister rails were still not quite parallel, they had not been put back perfectly all that time ago. She ought to have warned the removers, surely she ought. But now it was too late. Any moment now they would find it. She looked around, dazed and panic-stricken.
'Are you all right, love?' Fred was saying. 'Mind yourself, it's just the piano to come now, and then we'll be on our way.' She moved from the bottom stair, heart beating. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing in the back of the hallway to watch. 'No tears then?' Fred said, conversationally.
Truth to tell she was just on the edge of them. How odd that simply moving things made them matter. Chairs and cups and things, hundreds of things, that one never noticed or gave a moment's thought to while they stayed put, now they were displaced, were full of pathos, crying out to be cared about - and she would have cried, in a moment, surely she would.
Only just then the piano appeared, lurching at the top of the stairs, with Fred backing down in front of it and one of the others behind. It tipped slightly. 'Easy does it!' cried Fred, and they carried smoothly down the stairs and out of the front door, and put it down behind the removal van on the road.
It was Robert who laughed first, but then they couldn't stop laughing, relieved that it was all over. All three of them, helplessly, leaning against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. 'What's the joke, then?' asked Fred, but he merely started them off again. So that, as they went, the three of them, arm in arm down the path for the last time, the only tears she shed were tears of laughter.",C2,,"Moving Day

Susan is a widow. Her children are adults now. She must leave the family home.

A big van is outside. It says 'Special Movers' on the side. The movers are taking everything from the house. They are wrapping all her things in paper and putting them in boxes. Fred is the boss mover. He has big fingers, but he is careful with the breakable things. His helpers are not so careful.

It is a beautiful house. It has four floors and looks over a small harbour. Susan thinks about all the years she lived here. She remembers her children growing up and leaving home. These memories are in the air, like dust.

Her son, Robert, is here to help. He is a man now. When he was five, they bought this house. He asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you bring it home?"" Her daughter, Francesca, is also here. She is bossy. She is making sure the movers are careful with the piano.

Fred the mover said to Susan, ""You don't look like you will cry. That's good.""
""Do people cry?"" Susan asked.
""Oh yes,"" said Fred. ""People are happy until the house is empty. Then they stand in the empty rooms and cry. But they are happy again at the new house.""

Susan thought she should have told the movers about the piano. But Robert said no. He said it is the movers' job to see the problem. The piano is in the best room upstairs. They will move it last.

Susan sat on the bottom step. All the chairs were gone. She remembered the day they moved in. That day was like today, but in reverse. The piano was the first thing they brought in. And it got stuck on the stairs.

The movers tried for two hours. They could not get the piano up the stairs. Little Robert watched. Young Francesca cried, ""We can't live here without a piano! I would rather die!"" They had to find a way.

Her husband, Peter, came home and solved the problem. They left the piano in the garden. The next day, a builder took out a big window on the first floor. They borrowed a small crane from the harbour. A farmer used his tractor to pull the crane up the hill. They wrapped the piano in blankets. The crane lifted it safely through the big window. The children were so happy.

But it cost a lot of money. They could not pay to tune the piano for many months. Peter said, ""That's it. The piano will stay here forever."" But forever is a long time.

Now, the children are busy and don't visit often. Susan finds the stairs difficult. She remembered the problem with the stairs. The handrail was still not straight from that day. She should have told the movers. But it was too late. They would find out soon. She felt scared.

""Are you okay?"" Fred asked. ""Be careful. We just have the piano to move, then we will go."" Susan moved from the step. Her heart was beating fast. Robert and Francesca were in the hall, watching. ""No tears?"" Fred asked.

Susan almost cried. It is strange. When things are in their place, you don't notice them. But when you move them, they seem sad. She wanted to cry.

Then the piano came to the top of the stairs. Fred walked backwards in front of it. Another man was behind it. The piano tipped a little. ""Slowly!"" Fred said. They carried it carefully down the stairs and out the door. They put it on the road behind the van.

Robert laughed first. Then they all laughed. They were so happy it was over. The three of them leaned on each other, laughing and laughing. ""What is so funny?"" Fred asked. This made them laugh more.

So, as they walked down the path together for the last time, the only tears Susan cried were tears of laughter.","Moving Day

Susan is a widow and her children are adults now. She has to leave the family home.

The van outside said 'Special Movers'. Susan saw that the movers were taking away everything that made the house special. Fred, the man in charge, was wrapping these things in paper and putting them in boxes. He had very big fingers, but he was careful with the breakable things. His helpers were not as gentle.

It was a beautiful house she was leaving. It had four floors and looked over a small harbour. The years she had lived there, the years of her children growing up and moving out, felt like they were still in the air, like dust you can see in the light.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert was five. He asked, ""Mum, when you buy a house, how do you bring it home?"" Now Robert was a man, and he was here to help. He especially did not want her to tell the movers about the piano. Her daughter Francesca was also there, helping in her bossy way. She was sure that only she, the daughter, could be careful enough with their special Steinway piano.

""She doesn't look like she will cry,"" Fred said. ""That's good."" ""Do people cry?"" Susan asked, interested. ""You would be surprised,"" Fred said. ""They are happy and helpful until everything is in the van. Then you see them, crying in the middle of an empty room. They are fine when we get to the new house. It's just seeing everything taken away that makes them sad.""

Susan could understand that.

If she had been alone, Susan would have told the movers about the piano before they gave her a price. But Robert had said it was their job to see the problem. The piano was now alone in the upstairs sitting room, the nicest room in the house. They would take it last, of course. Susan sat on the bottom step because all the chairs were gone. She remembered the day they moved in.

Today was like that day, but in reverse. When they moved in, the piano was the first thing they brought. And it got stuck on the stairs. For almost two hours, the movers tried to get it up, but it seemed impossible.

They tried to bring it up and then down again. They even cut some of the wooden rails on the stairs, but it was still stuck. Little Robert watched with interest, and young Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano! I would rather die!"" And of course they couldn't, not with a musical daughter who would one day be a pianist. They had to find a way to get it inside, and they did.

Her late husband, Peter, came home and solved the problem. They left the piano in the garden while they brought in the other furniture - they had less furniture then, they were young and didn't have much money. The next day, they surprised everyone by getting a builder to take out a big window on the first floor.

Then, from the harbour below the house, they borrowed a small crane. A local farmer used his tractor to pull it up the hill. Finally, they wrapped the piano in blankets, hooked it to the crane, and carefully lifted it through the big open window. The children were so happy, they danced with joy.

But the whole thing cost so much money that it was months before they could pay someone to tune the piano. ""That's it,"" Peter had said. ""It will stay here forever."" But forever is a very long time.

As the years passed, the children were too busy to visit on weekends. Susan found it harder to walk up and down the stairs. Thinking about the stairs brought her back to the present. The wooden rails on the stairs were still not quite straight; they were never fixed perfectly after the piano was moved in. She really should have told the movers. But now it was too late. They would find out any moment. She looked around, feeling confused and scared.

""Are you okay?"" Fred asked. ""Be careful, we just have the piano left, and then we will go."" She moved away from the stairs, her heart beating fast. Robert and Francesca were both there now, standing in the hall to watch. ""No tears?"" Fred asked in a friendly way.

The truth was, she was almost crying. It was strange how moving things made them so important. Chairs, cups, and hundreds of other things that she never noticed before were now full of feeling. They seemed to ask for her care. She would have cried, she was sure of it.

But just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs. Fred was walking backwards in front of it, and another man was behind it. It leaned to one side. ""Slowly!"" Fred shouted. They carried it smoothly down the stairs and out the front door. They put it down on the road behind the moving van.

Robert was the first to laugh, and then they couldn't stop. They were so relieved it was over. All three of them leaned on each other, laughing and gasping for air. ""What's so funny?"" Fred asked, but this just made them laugh more. So, as they walked away from the house for the last time, arm in arm, the only tears she cried were tears of laughter.","MOVING DAY

Susan, a widow whose children are now adults, is leaving the family home.

The moving van was from a company called 'Removers of Distinction'. Susan noticed that the men were carefully taking away everything that made the house special. Fred, the removal man, and his team were wrapping all the objects in newspaper and packing them into boxes. Fred had very large fingers, but he handled the delicate items gently. His helpers were not as careful.

It was a beautiful house she was leaving, a tall, elegant building with a view of a small harbour. The memories of the years she had spent there, watching her children grow up and move away, seemed to be everywhere in the air, like dust that had been disturbed.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert was five years old. He had asked, 'Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?' It was hard to believe that little boy was now the grown man who was here helping her today. He was making sure she did not tell the movers about the piano. Her daughter Francesca was also there, helping in her controlling way. She was sure that only she, the daughter, would be careful enough with the family's valuable Steinway piano.

'She doesn't look like she's going to cry,' Fred commented. 'That's good.' 'Do people cry?' Susan asked, curious. 'You'd be surprised,' Fred said. 'They are often very cheerful and helpful until everything is in the van. Then you turn around and find them crying in the middle of an empty room. They are usually fine when we get to the new house. It's just seeing their home taken apart that upsets them.'

Susan could understand that.

If she had been alone, Susan would have told the movers about the piano before they gave her a price. But Robert had told her seriously that it was their job to notice the problem. The piano was now alone in the upstairs living room, the nicest room in the house. They would move it last, of course. Susan sat on the bottom step because all the chairs were gone, and she remembered the day they had moved in.

Today felt like a film of that day, but playing in reverse. Back then, the piano had been the first thing they tried to bring in. And it had got stuck on the stairs. For almost two hours, the removal men tried hard to move it, but it seemed impossible.

They tried to bring it up and down the stairs, they even cut part of the handrail, but it was still stuck. Little Robert watched with great interest, while young Francesca cried, 'We can't live in a house without a piano! I'd rather die!' And of course, they couldn't, not with a musical daughter who was going to be a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it inside, and they did.

Her late husband, Peter, came home and solved the problem. They left the piano in the garden while they moved in the other furniture - they had much less then, as they were young and didn't have much money. The next day, to everyone's surprise, they hired a builder to take out a large window on the first floor.

Then, they borrowed a small crane from the harbour below the house, where fishermen unloaded their catch. A local farmer used his tractor to pull the crane up the hill. Finally, they wrapped the piano in blankets, attached it to the crane, and carefully lifted it through the big open window. The children were delighted and danced with joy.

However, the whole process was so expensive that they couldn't afford to have the piano tuned for months. 'That's that,' Peter had said. 'It's staying there forever.' But forever is a very long time.

As the years passed, the children became too busy to visit on weekends. Susan found it more difficult to move around the house and was out of breath when she climbed the stairs. This thought brought her out of her daydream. The handrail on the stairs was still not completely straight; it had never been fixed perfectly after the piano was moved in. She really should have warned the movers. But now it was too late. They would discover the problem at any moment. She looked around, feeling confused and scared.

'Are you all right?' Fred asked. 'Be careful, we just have the piano left, and then we'll be finished.' She moved away from the stairs, her heart beating fast. Robert and Francesca had both come to stand in the hall to watch. 'No tears?' Fred said in a friendly way.

The truth was, she was very close to crying. It was strange how moving objects made them seem so important. Chairs, cups, and hundreds of other things that she never noticed or thought about when they were in their place now seemed sad and wanted her to care about them. She would have cried, she was sure of it.

But just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs. Fred was walking backwards in front of it, and another man was behind it. It leaned to one side. 'Slowly!' Fred shouted, and they carried it smoothly down the stairs, out the front door, and placed it on the road behind the van.

Robert was the first to laugh, and then they all couldn't stop. They were so relieved it was over. All three of them leaned against each other, laughing helplessly and trying to catch their breath. 'What's so funny?' Fred asked, but this just made them laugh even more. So, as they walked arm in arm down the path for the last time, the only tears she cried were tears of laughter.","MOVING DAY

Now that her children were adults, Susan, a widow, was confronted with the prospect of leaving the family home.

The removal van was emblazoned with the words 'Removers of Distinction', and Susan observed that every distinctive feature of the house was indeed being stripped away. All the items that gave the house its unique character were being carefully wrapped in newspaper and packed into boxes by Fred, the removal man, whose enormous, sausage-like fingers handled the fragile objects with surprising tenderness, and his team of assistants, who were considerably less gentle.

The house she was leaving was beautiful—an elegant, four-storey building with a view over a small harbour. The memories of the years spent there, watching her children grow up and eventually move out, seemed to linger in the air, faintly perceptible like unsettled dust.

She recalled when they had first bought the house. Robert, who was five at the time, had asked thoughtfully, 'Mum, when you buy a house, how do you get it home?' It was difficult to reconcile the grown man now assisting her with the little boy he had once been. Robert was present, helping with the move and, in particular, ensuring she did not mention the piano. Francesca was also there, offering assistance in her characteristically domineering manner, convinced that only she, as the family's daughter, would handle a fine instrument like the Steinway piano with the necessary care.

'She doesn't look like she's going to break down on us,' Fred remarked. 'That's a good sign.' 'Do people often cry?' Susan inquired, curious. 'More often than you'd think,' Fred replied. 'They're cheerful and helpful until everything's loaded into the van, and then you turn around and find them in tears in the middle of an empty room. They're usually fine by the time we reach the new place, though. It's just the sight of everything being dismantled that gets to them.'

Susan could easily picture the scene.

Left to her own devices, she would have informed the removal team about the piano before agreeing to their quote. However, Robert had insisted it was their responsibility to identify any potential issues, and their misfortune if they failed to do so. The piano now stood in solitary splendour in the upstairs sitting room, the finest room in the house. Naturally, it would be the last item to be moved. Sitting on the bottom step, since all the chairs were now gone, she remembered the day they had moved in.

The day she was currently experiencing felt like a film of that earlier day being played in reverse—the piano had been the first item brought in, and it had become stuck on the stairs. For nearly two hours, the removal team had struggled valiantly with it, until it seemed they would have to admit defeat.

They manoeuvred it up to the turn in the stairs and back down again, removed sections of the banister, and still managed to get it wedged, while a young Robert watched, captivated, and a tearful Francesca cried, 'We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't! I'd rather die!' And of course, they couldn't, not with a musically gifted daughter destined to become a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it inside, and eventually, a solution was found.

Peter, her late husband, had returned home to find the situation and resolved it. The piano was left in the garden while the rest of the furniture was brought inside—there was far less of it then, as they were relatively young and financially constrained. The following day, to everyone's astonishment, a builder was hired to remove a first-floor window.

Subsequently, a small crane was borrowed from the quay below the house, where fish were unloaded from local boats, and hauled up the hill using a farmer's tractor. Finally, the piano was wrapped in blankets, attached to the crane, and carefully lifted through the large window opening, to the delight of the enthralled children, who danced with joy at the spectacle.

However, the entire operation had been so costly that it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned. 'That's that,' Peter had declared. 'It's there for good.' But 'for good' is a very long time.

As the children became increasingly occupied with their own lives and visited less frequently, and Susan found the stairs more challenging to climb, she began to reconsider the house. The thought of the stairs brought her back to the present. The banister rails were still not perfectly aligned, a lasting reminder of the earlier incident. She felt she should have warned the removal team, but now it was too late. At any moment, they would discover the problem. She looked around, feeling disoriented and anxious.

'Are you all right, love?' Fred asked. 'Watch your step—just the piano to go, and then we'll be on our way.' She moved away from the bottom step, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing at the back of the hallway to observe. 'No tears, then?' Fred commented casually.

In truth, she was on the verge of crying. It was strange how moving objects made them suddenly significant. Chairs, cups, and countless other items that had gone unnoticed or unappreciated while in their usual places now seemed poignant and deserving of attention in their displaced state—and she would have cried, she was sure of it.

Just then, the piano emerged, swaying slightly at the top of the stairs, with Fred leading the way down and another man behind. It tilted a little. 'Steady now!' Fred called out, and they proceeded smoothly down the stairs, out the front door, and placed it on the road behind the removal van.

Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all overcome with laughter, relieved that the ordeal was over. The three of them leaned against each other, breathless and laughing uncontrollably. 'What's so funny?' Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh harder. And so, as they walked arm in arm down the path for the final time, the only tears she shed were tears of laughter.",
309,"Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds.
But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports

There's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird, a bird of portent, augury and divination. Is it spelling out some sort of message from a world at the very edges of my imagination? Or is it just a poor bird stuck in a greenhouse?
Depending on your point of view, both could be true. Wrens have been flitting through the undergrowth of British culture ever since it began. In medieval times, a complicated system of observing the directions in which wrens flew determined the sort of luck the observer would experience. In modern times, the image of the wren remains in pictures and ceramics in many British households. Even though the early beliefs may have been watered down or even forgotten, the wren still has a perch in our consciousness and a nest in our affections. A wood without wrens is a sad, impoverished place.
This is almost certainly because there is a rich vein of folklore running through our relationships with many birds which reaches back to a time when people read the world around them differently. Where people are, necessarily, hitched more directly to natural processes for their very survival, they develop an ecological and cultural language through which the significance of other creatures is communicated. This significance is, of course, prone to cultural shifts that cause major image changes for the creatures involved. A good example of this is the red kite. During the early sixteenth century, foreign visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take bread from the hands of children. These birds were protected and valued urban scavengers. But it was not long before they began to be seen as vermin, and as a result were soon wiped out in most areas apart from Wales. Gradually red kites began to assume a romantic personality linked to this Celtic stronghold and they have now become totemic birds of British conservation, protected again and reintroduced with a view to helping them regain their original distribution.
Our relationship with other creatures is more than cultural and goes way back to the evolution of human nature. Though the first human birdwatchers may have been acutely observant of bird behaviour because it announced approaching predators, bad weather and the availability of food, and also offered a supernatural link to the world of their dreams, there is more to it. When we ask why birds are so important to us, we are also asking what it is to be us. Flight, song, freedom - our fascination, envy and emulation of the avian world is surely a measure of our own identity against that of the wildness of nature. Some might dismiss these feelings as vestigial attachments, useful to us in an earlier phase of our evolution, irrelevant now. But, like the appendix and wisdom teeth, they're still very much part of us and losing them is traumatic.
That is probably why, in recent years, birds have become the barometers of environmental change, indicators of ecological quality: the warning bells of environmentalism. Conservationists in Britain cite the endangering of 30 species, a figure that is depressing not only because it spells out the loss of feathered curiosities, but because it is a massive cultural loss too.These birds carry a huge amount of cultural baggage. For example, the skylark, turtle dove and lapwing signify spiritual love, romantic love and magic. Anyone who has read Shelley's poems, Shakespeare's sonnets and Robert Graves's The White Goddess will feel more than a tug of remorse at the loss of these once commonplace birds.
Yet while the loss of these birds is lamented, the loss of others which don't figure in either literature or folklore is virtually ignored. Folklore is so important. The stories, legends and rhymes which persist through time, with their obscure origins, constant revisions and reinventions, somehow have a greater living bond with their subjects than cold, scientific terms a bond that is strengthened by the everyday language in which they are understood and communicated. This gives them a power to summon up feelings and attitudes from a consciousness buried under all the stuff of modern life.
Whether we watch wildlife films on TV or birdtables in the backyard, what were doing and the excitement we get from what we see cannot adequately be captured by scientific reason. Birds are engaging in ways we still find hard to fathom, let alone articulate, and so the stories we tell about them seem like ways of interpreting what birds are telling us.
The wren in the greenhouse weaves an intricate knot, tying an imaginary thread between the here and now and a deep, distant history, holding the free end in its song and escaping into the future - a riddle that keeps me guessing.
",C2,,,"People have always had strong feelings about birds. We love them, we are afraid of them, and sometimes we even worship them. But what does this tell us about ourselves? Paul Evans writes about this.

In the greenhouse, I hear a small noise. A little brown bird is hitting the glass. It is a wren. In the past, people thought wrens could tell the future. Is this bird trying to send me a message from another world? Or is it just a bird that is trapped?

Maybe both ideas are true. Wrens have always been a part of life in Britain. Long ago, people believed that the direction a wren flew could tell you if you would have good or bad luck. Today, you can still see pictures of wrens in many British homes. We may not believe the old stories anymore, but we still like wrens. A forest without wrens feels empty.

This is because we have many old stories about birds. A long time ago, people's lives depended on nature. They created stories to explain the world and the animals in it. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London. People protected them because they cleaned the streets. But later, people saw them as pests and killed them. They only survived in Wales. Now, people think of red kites as special birds of Wales. We protect them again and are helping them return to other parts of the country.

Our connection to animals is very old. The first humans watched birds carefully. Birds could warn them about danger, bad weather, or where to find food. People also thought birds had a connection to the spirit world. But it is more than that. When we ask why birds are important to us, we are also asking what it means to be human. We admire their flight, their songs, and their freedom. Some people might say these feelings are not important today. But these feelings are still a part of who we are, and losing them would be sad.

This is probably why birds are now seen as signs of the health of our environment. In Britain, 30 types of birds are in danger. This is sad not just because we are losing the birds, but because we are losing a part of our culture too. These birds are important in our stories. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing are symbols of love and magic. People who have read famous books and poems feel sad to lose these birds that were once common.

We feel sad about losing birds that are in stories, but we often forget about other birds that are not in stories. Folklore is very important. The old stories and rhymes have a strong connection to these animals. This connection is stronger than just scientific names. Because we use simple, everyday language for these stories, they can make us feel things that science cannot.

Whether we watch nature programmes on TV or birds in our garden, the joy we feel is hard to explain with science. Birds interest us in ways that are difficult to understand. The stories we tell about them help us explain what birds mean to us.

The wren in the greenhouse connects today with the distant past. Its song is like a mystery that I am still trying to solve.","People have always had strong feelings about birds - loving them, fearing them, or even worshipping them. But what does this tell us about ourselves? Paul Evans investigates.

In my greenhouse, I hear a soft bumping sound. A small brown bird is hitting the glass. It's a wren - a bird that people have long believed could predict the future. Is it trying to send me a message from another world? Or is it simply a bird that can't find its way out?

Both ideas could be true, depending on how you look at it. Wrens have been part of British culture for centuries. In the Middle Ages, people thought the direction a wren flew could tell you whether you would have good or bad luck. Today, many British homes still have pictures or decorations showing wrens. Even though people no longer believe in the old superstitions, wrens remain special to us. A forest without wrens feels empty and sad.

This connection comes from our long history of folklore about birds. In the past, when people depended more directly on nature for survival, they developed ways of understanding animals that became part of their culture. These meanings can change over time. Take the red kite, for example. In the 1500s, visitors to London were surprised to see these birds taking bread from children's hands. People valued them as city cleaners. But later, people began to see them as pests and killed most of them, except in Wales. Eventually, red kites became symbols of Welsh heritage and are now protected birds that conservationists are helping to return to other areas.

Our relationship with birds goes deeper than culture and connects to our basic human nature. Early humans watched birds carefully because birds could warn them about danger, bad weather, or where to find food. Birds also seemed to connect them to spiritual worlds. When we ask why birds matter to us, we're really asking what makes us human. We admire their ability to fly, their songs, and their freedom. Our fascination with birds helps us understand our own place in nature. Some might say these feelings are leftovers from our evolutionary past that no longer matter. But like wisdom teeth, they're still part of who we are, and losing them would be painful.

This might explain why birds have become important indicators of environmental health in recent years. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered. This is sad not only because we're losing these interesting creatures, but because we're losing part of our culture too. Birds carry cultural meanings - for instance, skylarks represent spiritual love, turtle doves symbolize romantic love, and lapwings are connected to magic. People who know the poetry of Shelley, Shakespeare, or Robert Graves would feel the loss of these once-common birds deeply.

While we mourn the loss of these culturally important birds, we often ignore other endangered birds that don't appear in stories or legends. Folklore matters because the stories, legends, and poems that survive through time - even when their origins are forgotten or they change over years - create a stronger connection to these creatures than scientific terms ever can. These stories, told in everyday language, can bring up feelings and attitudes that lie hidden beneath modern life.

Whether we watch nature documentaries on television or observe birds at garden feeders, the excitement we feel can't be fully explained by science. Birds interest us in ways that are difficult to understand or put into words. The stories we tell about them help us interpret what birds might be telling us.

The wren in my greenhouse connects the present moment to our distant past through its song before flying away into the future - leaving me with a mystery to think about.","Whether we revere, fear, or idolize them, birds have consistently occupied a significant place in human culture.  
But what does this reveal about us? Paul Evans investigates.

A faint, repetitive tapping emanates from the greenhouse—a small brown wren, fluttering against the glass. In folklore, the wren is a bird of omen, associated with prophecy and foresight. Is this visitor conveying a message from realms just beyond my imagination, or is it merely a trapped bird?  
Depending on one’s perspective, both interpretations may hold truth. Wrens have been woven into the fabric of British culture since its earliest days. In medieval times, complex systems of divination were based on observing the direction of a wren’s flight. Today, their image persists in household ceramics and artwork. Even as ancient beliefs have faded or been diluted, the wren retains a place in our collective consciousness and affections. A woodland devoid of wrens feels barren and diminished.

This enduring connection stems from a deep-seated folklore that underpins our relationships with numerous bird species—a legacy from an era when humans interpreted the natural world through a different lens. In societies more directly dependent on natural cycles for survival, people developed an ecological and cultural vocabulary to express the significance of other living beings. This significance, however, is subject to cultural shifts that can dramatically alter a species’ perceived image. The red kite offers a compelling example. In the early sixteenth century, visitors to London were astonished to see these birds snatching bread from children’s hands. At that time, red kites were protected and valued as urban scavengers. Yet, within a relatively short period, they came to be regarded as vermin and were consequently eradicated from most regions, surviving only in Wales. Over time, the red kite acquired a romantic association with this Celtic refuge and has since become an emblem of British conservation—reintroduced and protected in an effort to restore its former range.

Our bond with other species transcends culture and is rooted in the evolution of human nature. Early humans observed birds not only to detect predators, predict weather, or locate food sources, but also to connect with the supernatural realm of dreams. Yet there is more to this relationship. In questioning why birds matter so deeply to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. Flight, birdsong, freedom—our fascination, envy, and emulation of avian life reflect how we define ourselves in relation to the natural world. Some may dismiss such sentiments as evolutionary relics, no longer relevant. Yet, like the appendix or wisdom teeth, these impulses remain integral to our identity, and their loss would be deeply unsettling.

This may explain why birds have increasingly become barometers of environmental change and indicators of ecological integrity—the alarm bells of the conservation movement. In Britain, conservationists report that 30 bird species are now endangered—a statistic that is disheartening not only because it signifies the disappearance of remarkable creatures, but also because it represents a profound cultural loss. These birds carry substantial cultural weight. The skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing, for instance, embody spiritual love, romantic love, and enchantment. Anyone familiar with Shelley’s verse, Shakespeare’s sonnets, or Robert Graves’s *The White Goddess* cannot help but feel a pang of sorrow at the decline of these once-familiar birds.

Yet, while the loss of such culturally prominent species is widely mourned, the disappearance of others lacking literary or folkloric resonance often goes unnoticed. Folklore matters profoundly. The stories, legends, and rhymes that endure across generations—despite their obscure origins and constant reinterpretation—forge a more intimate bond with their subjects than detached scientific terminology ever could. This bond is reinforced by the everyday language through which such traditions are shared and understood, enabling them to evoke emotions and attitudes buried beneath the surface of modern life.

Whether we observe birds on television documentaries or at garden feeders, the engagement and excitement we experience cannot be fully explained by scientific reasoning. Birds captivate us in ways that remain elusive and difficult to articulate. The stories we tell about them may, therefore, serve as our attempts to interpret what birds are communicating.

The wren in the greenhouse weaves a complex thread—linking the present moment to a distant past, holding one end in its song as it vanishes into the future. It remains an enigma, leaving me to ponder its mystery.",
310,"Citizen Kane

When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor's fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst, its alleged subject, might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. It is perhaps the one film, above all others, that has inspired people to become film-makers. This is all the more astonishing since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles always maintained that its success arose from his having no idea of what he was or wasn't allowed to do: he just went ahead and did it. But he had an extraordinary team at his disposal, cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and the special-effects wizard Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz hit on the idea of portraying a newspaper magnate who both was and wasn't Hearst, Welles realised that he had found a perfect vehicle for himself both as director and actor, and seized his chance with the energy of a whirlwind.

Dermot and Carmel

Dermot thought that Carmel was rather odd that morning. Twice he had said that he might be late and not to worry if he dropped into the golf club on the way home. He had to have a natter with someone and that was the best place to have it. Twice she had nodded her head amiably and distantly as if she hadn't really heard or understood. 
'Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?' he had asked.
She had smiled. 'Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I hadn't anything to do all day so I was going to stroll down town and look at the shops. I was thinking that it was almost a sinful thing, just idling away the day.'
Dermot had smiled back. 'You're entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I""m late I won't want anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble.'
'No, that's fine.' she said.

Title Race 

Tea boy? Do you mind, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator
Human nature provides the most divine of comedies. Witness a recent study which has informed the nation that job titles are a prime cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a leading firm of recruitment consultants found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues.
Most shockingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to forgo a pay rise in favour of a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our vanity is reaching such proportions that even basic greed is being overwhelmed, we are indeed in dire straits.
The truth is that in these brave new days of the early twenty-first century, nobody is content to be labelled subordinate. The titles under discussion place the emphasis on ability (specialist, coordinator) but are, in fact, little more than euphemisms.",C2,,,"**Citizen Kane**

The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. There was a lot of talk about it before its release. The release was delayed because the film's subject was said to be a powerful man named William Randolph Hearst, and the film company was afraid of him. When it was finally shown, most reviews were very positive. However, the film did not make much money. It only became famous again later because of television. Many people say this film made them want to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said he succeeded because he didn't know the rules of filmmaking, so he just did what he wanted. He also had a very talented team to help him, including the cameraman, the writer, and a special effects expert. Welles and the writer had the idea to create a character who was both like and unlike Hearst. Welles knew this was a perfect opportunity for him as a director and actor, and he worked with great energy.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He told her twice that he might be late because he wanted to stop at the golf club to talk to someone on his way home. Both times, she nodded in a friendly but distant way, as if she wasn't really listening.
""Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?"" he asked.
She smiled. ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do all day. I thought I would walk to town and look in the shops. I was thinking it's almost a bad thing to do nothing all day.""
Dermot smiled back. ""You should enjoy yourself. And like I said, if I'm late, I won't want any dinner. So don't worry about cooking.""
""No, that's fine,"" she said.

**Job Titles**

Human nature can be very funny. A recent study told the country that job titles are a main reason for jealousy and problems at work. A survey by an important recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions between co-workers.
Most surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would say no to more money if they could get a better, more professional job title instead. If our pride is becoming more important than money, we have a serious problem.
The truth is that today, in the twenty-first century, nobody wants to be called someone's assistant. The new job titles often use words like 'specialist' or 'coordinator' to sound better, but they are often just nicer words for the same job.","**Citizen Kane**

She smiled. ""It's funny you should ask. I was just thinking that I have nothing to do all day, so I'm going to walk into town and look at the shops. I thought it seemed almost wrong, just spending the day doing nothing.""
Dermot smiled back. ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late, I won't want anything to eat. So don't worry about cooking.""
""No, that's fine,"" she said.

**Title Race**

Tea boy? Please, I'm a Mobile Hot Drink Coordinator.
Human nature can be very amusing. For example, a recent study told the country that job titles are a major reason for jealousy and unhappiness at work. A survey by an important recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees agree that titles create divisions between colleagues.
Most surprisingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would refuse a pay increase if they could get a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title instead. If our pride is becoming so strong that it is more important than money, we are in a difficult situation.
The reality is that in the modern world of the 21st century, nobody is happy to be called someone's assistant. The new titles often focus on a person's skills (like 'specialist' or 'coordinator') but are really just polite ways of saying the same thing.","**Citizen Kane**

Upon its eventual release in 1941, *Citizen Kane* was met with considerable critical acclaim, yet it failed to achieve commercial success, despite the controversy surrounding its launch. This was partly due to distributors' apprehensions regarding William Randolph Hearst, the figure widely believed to be the film's subject. It was television that later revived public interest in the film. Arguably more than any other, this is the film that has motivated countless individuals to pursue careers in filmmaking. This is particularly remarkable given that it was Orson Welles's directorial debut. Welles himself often claimed that the film's achievement stemmed from his own ignorance of cinematic conventions; he simply proceeded without restraint. He was, however, supported by an exceptionally talented team, including cinematographer Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz conceived the idea of a newspaper magnate who was both inspired by and distinct from Hearst, Welles recognized an ideal project to showcase his talents as both director and actor, which he pursued with immense energy.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot found Carmel's behaviour somewhat peculiar. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and could stop at the golf club on his way home, as he needed to have a conversation with someone and that was a convenient location. On both occasions, she had nodded in a friendly yet detached manner, as if she had not fully registered or comprehended what he had said.
'Will you be alright? What are your plans for the day?' he had inquired.
She had smiled. 'It's funny you should ask. I was just thinking I had no obligations today, so I thought I would take a leisurely walk into town and browse the shops. It occurred to me that it seemed almost indulgent, simply passing the time without any purpose.'
Dermot had returned her smile. 'You deserve to relax. And as I said, if I am late, I won't need a meal, so please don't go to any trouble on my account.'
'No, that's perfectly fine,' she replied.

**Title Race**

Tea boy? I must object; my role is better described as a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.
Human nature often produces the most exquisite comedies. Consider a recent study which revealed to the nation that job titles are a significant source of envy and friction in the workplace. A survey conducted by a prominent recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees acknowledge that titles create divisions among staff.
Most strikingly, the survey discovered that 70% of office workers would be prepared to sacrifice a pay increase in exchange for a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our vanity has escalated to the point of overriding fundamental self-interest, we are undoubtedly in a precarious situation.
The reality is that in the contemporary climate of the early twenty-first century, few are willing to accept a label that implies a subordinate position. The titles in question tend to emphasize competence and specialization, yet they frequently serve as little more than euphemisms.",
311,"Writing by hand and on screen

Dr Johnson maintained that 'what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure'. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. I am sure the reason was that they were physically hard to write. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. What would be difficult to alter or erase was written with care. The casual facility of the computer leads to sloppiness. Most writers using word processors find the time spent correcting early drafts more or less equates with the time originally spent on handwritten text.
Equally, the e-mail, unlike the handwritten letter, is emotionally ponderous. This electronic Eros is said to have revive the art of the love letter. Millions of these missives now flow down the lines, where previously there was only idle chatter. Hurrah for that. At least these e-mails are written, in a sort of English and a sort of grammar: But words printed on a screen pack a monotonous punch. Their writers are often unaccustomed to the power of the written word and tend, in computer jargon, to 'flare'. Their meaning becomes exaggerated and distorted in transmission. And printed words written in haste lack the care and character of handwriting.

The CD

I put down my cup and went to inspect the CD. The case was disappointing but the rainbow-silver disc inside looked interesting.
'Wonderful little things, aren't they?' Mr Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed, gingerly handing the disc to him. 'Amazing they manage to squeeze seventy minutes of music onto them,' he continued, bending to the hi-fi device. He switched it on and all sorts of lights came on. He pressed a button and a little drawer slid out of the machine. He put the disc inside, pressed the button again and the tray glided back in again. 'Of course, some people say they sound sterile, but I think they...'
'Do you have to turn them over, like records?' I asked.
'What? No,' Mr Warriston said, straightening. 'No, you only play one side.'
'Why?' I asked him.
He looked nonplussed, and then thoughtful. 'You know,' he said, 'I've no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity...' He stared down at the machine. 'You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm.' He smiled at me. 'Yes, good point.' He nodded over at my wooden chair. 'Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?'
I smiled, pleased to have thought of a technical question Mr Warriston could not answer.

Books versus Electronic Text

In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury was spot on when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we'd have marvelled at the improvement. Most of the propaganda, dazzled by newness, states that electronic text is a change comparable to the invention of printing and that it is already nearly completed. It ignores the fact that shifts in consciousness take generations and such rhetoric falls into the trap of chronocentricity, the egotism that one's own generation sits on the very cusp of history. Take this treasure from Mighty Micro, a book from 1979: 'The 1980s will see the book as we know it, and as our ancestors created and cherished it, begin a slow and steady slide to oblivion.' So far, so wrong. Reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most never do it and, in any case, the organisation of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text. Techno-proselytisers have extracted virtue here by claiming that inherent flightiness leads to new forms of narrative and imaginative space. But there's nothing new about 'non-linearity'. Lots of books have never been read from beginning to end - most religious texts, dictionaries and poetry collections spring to mind. What is new is not so much the branchings of electronic text as that computers don't invite the joined-up thinking of reading anything in its entirety.

The Office

Charles Walked through the office door and into a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of the paper avalanche which had buried it on the very day it was put down, and the naked desk was dark wood, just as he remembered it from the Sotheby's auction of five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being put in their proper drawers. Twelve years of trade journals now filled the shelves on one wall.
Kathleen strained to close the door of the filing cabinet and then turned on him. 'You have to go to computers, Charles. This is just too much.'
'Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing.' He was admiring the room, its antique furniture. He was not visualising a computer or any other mechanical device in it, not even a pencil sharpener. 'Simply amazing,' he said, altogether skirting the issue of computers.
Over the two years he had known her, they'd had this conversation many times. She could never understand his resistance to the technology when he was so adept at computers and had even published an important paper on computer-mode giftedness. She had been the inspiration for that paper. Via the keyboard, she could dip her fingers into the stuffing of any software and make it into a new animal that could sit up and bark at the moon if she wished.",C2,,"Writing by hand and on a computer

A smart person said that easy writing is not fun to read. Good writing takes time. I looked at my old school papers. They were written by hand. I did not cross out many words. Today, I would change my writing many times. I think this is because writing by hand is slow. The slowness makes you think. You are careful because changing words is hard. Writing on a computer is easy. So people can be messy. Many writers find that fixing writing on a computer takes as much time as writing by hand.

Also, an email is not like a handwritten letter. People say email made love letters popular again. Many people now write love emails. Before, they only talked. This is good. At least people are writing. But words on a screen all look the same. People who do not write often use words that are too strong. Their meaning can be wrong. Words written fast on a screen do not have the care of handwriting.

The CD

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The cover was not nice. But the shiny disc inside looked good.
""These are great, yes?"" Mr. Warriston said. He came back into the room. I said yes. I carefully gave him the disc. ""It is amazing. They can put seventy minutes of music on this,"" he said. He bent down to the music player. He turned it on. Many lights came on. He pressed a button. A small drawer opened. He put the disc in. He pressed the button again. The drawer closed. ""Some people say the sound is not good. But I think...""
""Do you turn it over, like a record?"" I asked.
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said. He stood up. ""No, you play one side only.""
""Why?"" I asked.
He looked surprised. Then he thought. ""You know,"" he said, ""I don't know. Why not use both sides? Then you have more music."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers. Or turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good question."" He pointed to my chair. ""Come. Let's find the best place for you to sit. Then you can hear the music well.""
I smiled. I was happy. I asked a question about technology. Mr. Warriston could not answer it.

Books and computer screens

Let's compare books and reading on a screen. One writer was right. He said: If we had matches after lighters, we would think matches are great. Many people love new technology. They say reading on a screen is a big change. They say it is like when printing started. They say this change is almost done. But they forget one thing. It takes a long time for people to think in new ways. They think their time is the most important time. For example, a book from 1979 said: ""In the 1980s, books will start to go away."" This was wrong. Reading a long text on a screen is not nice. So most people do not do it. Also, computers make people read only small parts of a text. People who love technology say this is good. They say it makes new kinds of stories. But stories you do not read from start to end are not new. Think of religious books. Think of dictionaries. Think of books of poems. People do not always read these from beginning to end. What is new? Computers do not make you read a whole text. They do not make you think about all of it together.

The Office

Charles walked into the office. He saw a very tidy room. The carpet was clean. On the first day, it was covered with paper. The desk was empty. It was made of dark wood. He remembered it from an auction. That was a few weeks ago. Neat folders were going into the right drawers. Shelves on one wall were now full. They had old work magazines from twelve years.

Kathleen worked hard to close the filing cabinet door. Then she turned to Charles. ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much paper.""
""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this looks wonderful."" He was looking at the room and the old furniture. He did not think about a computer. He did not think about any machine. Not even a pencil sharpener. ""It's really wonderful,"" he said. He did not talk about computers.
He knew her for two years. They had this talk many times. She did not understand why he did not like technology. He was very good with computers. He even wrote an important paper about people who are very good with them. She was the reason he wrote that paper. Using a keyboard, she could change any computer program. She could make it do new and amazing things.","Writing by hand and on a computer

Dr Johnson once said that writing that is easy to write is usually not enjoyable to read. This means good writing is difficult. When I look at my old school essays written by hand, I see that I did not cross out many words. Today, I would write them again many times. I think this is because writing by hand is slow and physical. The slowness makes you think more carefully. You are careful because it is hard to change what you write. On a computer, writing is easy, so people can be careless. Many writers who use computers spend as much time correcting their first drafts as they used to spend writing by hand.

Also, an email is different from a handwritten letter. People say that email has brought back the love letter. Now, many people write love emails instead of just talking. That is good. At least these emails are written with some English and grammar. But words on a screen all look the same. People who write emails are often not used to writing and sometimes get too emotional. Their meaning can become too strong or unclear. Words written quickly on a screen do not have the care and personality of handwriting.

The CD

I put down my cup and went to look at the CD. The cover was not special, but the shiny disc inside looked nice.
""These are great little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully gave him the disc. ""It's amazing how they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he continued. He bent down to the music player, turned it on, and many lights came on. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He put the disc in, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say the sound is not warm, but I think they...""
""Do you need to turn it over, like a record?"" I asked.
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up straight. ""No, you only play one side.""
""Why?"" I asked him.
He looked surprised, then thoughtful. ""You know,"" he said, ""I don't know. I don't see why you couldn't use both sides and have twice the music..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, that's a good question."" He pointed to my chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's find the best place for you to sit to hear the music properly.""
I smiled. I was happy to think of a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.

Books and Electronic Text

When we compare books and electronic text, the writer Malcolm Bradbury was right. He said if matches were invented after lighters, we would think matches were a great new thing. Many people who love new technology say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that the change is almost finished. But they forget that changes in how people think take a very long time. This kind of thinking believes that our time is the most important in history. For example, a book from 1979 called *Mighty Micro* said, ""In the 1980s, books will start to disappear."" This was completely wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is so unpleasant that most people avoid it. Also, computers make people read small parts of text instead of the whole thing. Some technology fans say this is good because it creates new kinds of stories. But there is nothing new about not reading from start to finish. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry books, are often read this way. What is new is that computers do not encourage people to read something completely and think about it fully.

The Office

Charles walked through the office door into a very tidy room. The carpet was clean, not covered in paper like it was on the first day. The desk was empty and made of dark wood, just as he remembered from the auction a few weeks ago. Neat files were being put into the correct drawers. One wall had shelves filled with twelve years of business magazines.
Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet door and then turned to him. ""You need to start using computers, Charles. This is too much work.""
""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this looks wonderful."" He was looking around the room at the old furniture. He did not imagine a computer or any machine in the room, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Really wonderful,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers.
In the two years he had known her, they had this talk many times. She could not understand why he did not like technology when he was so good with computers. He had even written an important paper about people who are talented with computers. She had given him the idea for that paper. Using a keyboard, she could change any software and make it do new things if she wanted.","Writing by hand and on a computer

Many people, excited by new technology, say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that the change is almost complete.

For example, a book from 1979 called *Mighty Micro* said: ""In the 1980s, books will slowly disappear."" This was completely wrong. Reading anything long on a screen is so unpleasant that most people avoid it. Also, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to only read small parts of texts. Supporters of technology say that this tendency leads to new kinds of stories and creativity. But there is nothing new about ""non-linear"" reading. Many books, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections, are not usually read from start to finish. What is new is not the structure of electronic text, but that computers do not encourage people to read a whole text carefully and completely.

Reviewing my handwritten school essays, I was struck by how few corrections they contained. Today, I would have revised them repeatedly. I suspect this was because the physical effort of writing by hand imposed discipline on the mind. The difficulty of making alterations compelled careful composition. In contrast, the ease of computer use often results in carelessness. Most writers using word processors discover that the time spent revising initial drafts roughly equals that previously devoted to handwriting.

Similarly, email lacks the emotional resonance of handwritten correspondence. While digital communication is said to have revived the art of love letters, with countless messages now transmitted where once there was only trivial conversation, this development is not entirely positive. Although these emails are composed using basic English and grammar, words displayed on screen deliver a monotonous impact. Unpracticed writers frequently overstate their meaning, causing distortion in communication. Moreover, hastily typed messages lack the considered thought and personal touch characteristic of handwriting.

**The CD**

I set down my cup and examined the CD. The packaging was unimpressive, but the iridescent disc inside appeared intriguing.
""Remarkable inventions, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston remarked upon returning. I concurred, carefully passing him the disc. ""It's astonishing how they compress seventy minutes of music onto such a small surface,"" he continued, leaning toward the audio system. Activating the device, he pressed a button causing a tray to slide out. After placing the disc inside, he retracted the tray. ""Some critics claim the sound lacks warmth, but I believe...""
""Do you need to flip them over, like vinyl records?"" I inquired.
""Certainly not,"" Mr. Warriston responded, standing upright. ""Only one side is playable.""
""Why is that?"" I asked.
He appeared momentarily perplexed, then contemplative. ""You know, I've never considered that. There's no technical reason why both sides couldn't be used to double the capacity."" He studied the machine thoughtfully. ""You could install dual lasers or simply manually reverse the disc... interesting."" Smiling approvingly, he nodded toward my chair. ""Nevertheless, let's position you optimally to appreciate the stereo effect.""

**Books versus Electronic Text**

In assessing books against digital text, Malcolm Bradbury accurately observed that if matches had followed lighters, we would have celebrated them as a major advancement. Much contemporary commentary, captivated by novelty, proclaims electronic text as a transformation equivalent to the printing press's invention, suggesting this transition is nearly complete. This perspective overlooks how fundamental shifts in consciousness evolve over generations, falling prey to chronocentricity - the arrogant belief that one's own era represents history's pivotal point. Consider this prediction from Mighty Micro (1979): ""The 1980s will witness the gradual disappearance of books as we know them."" This forecast has proven entirely inaccurate. Reading extensive text on screens remains so unsatisfactory that few attempt it, and computer interfaces promote fragmented reading rather than sustained engagement. Technology advocates reframe this limitation as a virtue, claiming it fosters innovative narrative structures. However, non-linear reading is hardly novel - religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections have always been consulted selectively. The true innovation lies not in electronic text's branching capabilities, but in how computers discourage the comprehensive, connected thinking that reading complete works encourages.

**The Office**

Charles entered the office and encountered a perfectly ordered environment. The carpet was free of the paper accumulation that had covered it since installation, and the polished wooden desk stood exactly as he recalled from the Sotheby's auction weeks earlier. Neat document holders were being stored in appropriate drawers, while one wall's shelves now accommodated twelve years of trade publications.
Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet before confronting him. ""Charles, you must transition to digital systems. This is becoming unmanageable.""
""Kathleen, hello. This is extraordinary."" He admired the room's antique furnishings, deliberately avoiding any mental image of computers or mechanical devices. ""Truly remarkable,"" he repeated, deftly circumventing the technology discussion.
Throughout their two-year acquaintance, this conversation had recurred frequently. She couldn't comprehend his resistance to technology, particularly given his computer proficiency and his published research on computational aptitude. Ironically, she had inspired that very study. Through keyboard interaction, she possessed an exceptional ability to deconstruct and reconfigure any software, transforming it according to her requirements with remarkable skill.",
312,"The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. The way one picture, a single snapshot, could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, a human being, was embedded in my consciousness.
One day, one second, I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera. Finish one, load another, and keep looking, with eyes wide open. That was my code. Had been for a long time.
I'd come close once, when some weird aptness in the knotted shape of a smoke plume from a burning oil well made my picture the one newspapers and magazines all over the world suddenly wanted. Brief glory from an even briefer moment. Just luck, really. But they say you make your own - the bad as well as the good.
I went freelance after that, which should have been a clever move and would probably have worked out that way, but for life beyond the lens taking a few wrong turnings. The mid-nineties weren't quite the string of triumphs I'd foreseen when my defining image made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than anywhere even faintly newsworthy.
But, still, I was taking photographs. And I was being paid to do it. It didn't sound bad to me. The assignment was actually a piece of happenstance. I'd done the London shots for a glossy coffee-table picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, a European co-publishing venture that netted me a juicy commission to hang round moody locations in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I'd given my own particular slant to daffodils in Hyde Park and heat haze and traffic fumes in Piccadilly.
I'd also reconciled myself to the best and truest of what I'd delivered being tossed aside. It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn't meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.
It was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute's role.
The Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren't great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn't have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.
They put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I'd last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn't even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.
I knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.
The first day I didn't even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn't wanted to.
This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.
Next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn't figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there's always been something magical about photography.
It certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.
And even when you know why it happens you don't lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning failed in some strange way to surprise me.",C2,,"I was in Vienna to take photos. That was my job. I took photos for money. Photos were very important to me. I liked how light looked on things. I liked how one photo could show a special time or place. I always thought about this.

Maybe one day I would take the perfect photo. I always hoped for this. I always had film in my camera. When I finished one film, I put in a new one. I always looked for good photos. This was my life. It had been for many years.

One time, I took a photo of smoke from a fire. Many newspapers wanted that photo. I was famous for a short time. It was just luck. People say you make your own luck.

After that, I worked alone. This was a good idea, but my life had problems. The 1990s were not good for me. That's why I was in Vienna, not in a better place.

But I was still taking photos. And I was paid for it. That was good. This job in Vienna happened by chance. First, I took photos of London for a book. The book showed four cities in four seasons. I took pictures of London all year.

I knew my best photos might not be in the book. It was just a picture book. It was not for changing minds.

After I finished the winter photos, I got a message. The photographer in Vienna had left his job. No one told me why. They asked me to go to Vienna instead.

The book company in Austria liked my photos. I was free to go. The other photographers were busy. I was happy to go. Things at home were bad. A week taking photos of snowy Vienna was a good reason to leave. I went quickly.

I stayed at a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife. We saw many places in the summer. It was hot and busy. I did not take many photos then. Now, I was alone in cold January. It would be different.

I knew it when I got off the bus. I saw the light over the snowy roofs. I knew I would like it here. I knew I would take good photos.

On the first day, I did not take photos. I rode trams around the city. I got on and off where I wanted. I learned about the city. The weather was cold. I had not seen the other photographer's photos. I did not want to see them.

This would be my Vienna, not his. The city would show me its secrets. I just had to wait. A photo is one moment. But you must wait for the right moment. So I waited and looked. Then I was ready.

The next morning, I went out early. It snowed at night. Stephansplatz was white and empty. I did not know how to photograph the big church. The top was very high. The bottom was very wide. Maybe it was too big. I would take a photo of just part of it. In that weather, it could still be beautiful. Photography always feels a little like magic.

The first photographers felt this way too. A picture appears on paper in a dark room. Even when you know how, it still feels special. That feeling stays with you. Maybe that is why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning did not surprise me.","My job was to take photos in Vienna. That was why I was there. Photography was more than just work for me. It was my life. I loved how light touched things and how a photo could capture a moment or a place. This idea was always in my mind.

Maybe one day I would take the perfect picture. As long as I had film in my camera, it was possible. Finish one roll, put in another, and keep watching the world. That was my way of living. It had been for years.

Once, I almost succeeded. I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. The shape was unusual, and many newspapers and magazines wanted to use it. It was a short moment of fame. Just luck, some would say. But people also say you create your own luck, both good and bad.

After that, I started working for myself. It seemed like a good idea, but life outside of photography became difficult. The mid-1990s were not as successful as I had hoped when my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I was in Vienna, not in a more exciting place.

Still, I was taking photos and getting paid for it. That sounded good to me. This job happened by chance. I had taken pictures in London for a beautiful picture book called Four Cities in Four Seasons. The book featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. It was a European project, and I was paid well to take photos in London during all four seasons. I showed my own view of places like Hyde Park and Piccadilly.

I accepted that the best photos I took might not be used. After all, it was just a picture book. It wasn’t meant to change how people think or see the world.

Just after a cold Christmas and New Year, I finished my winter photos of London. Then I heard that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the Vienna job. No one told me why. Instead of finding someone new, they asked me to take his place.

The Austrian publishers liked my work. Also, I was available, but the French and Italian photographers were not. I was happy to go. Things at home were not good. A week taking photos of snowy Vienna didn’t need to be a special honor for me to accept immediately.

They gave me a room at the Europa Hotel on Neuer Markt, in the old city center. The last time I was in Vienna was for a weekend with my wife. We visited many palaces and museums in the summer. It was hot, busy, and not very memorable. I didn’t even take many photos then. Now, alone in cold January, it would be different.

I felt this as soon as I got off the airport bus. I saw the pink-grey light over the snowy roofs of the city. I knew I would enjoy myself here. I would take some great photos.

On the first day, I didn’t try to take any pictures. I rode trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I liked to feel the city’s mood. The weather was cold and still, like the old buildings from the past empire. I hadn’t seen Schussner’s photos of spring, summer, or autumn. I didn’t want to.

This would be my Vienna, not his. The city would show itself to me. I just had to wait. A photo is a single moment. But you have to wait for that moment to come. So I waited and looked until I could see clearly. Then I was ready.

The next morning, I went out at dawn. It had snowed during the night, so Stephansplatz was white and almost empty. I didn’t know how to photograph the whole cathedral in one picture. Its spire reached high into the grey sky, but at ground level, it was huge and wide. Maybe it was impossible. I would have to take a picture of just part of it. In that weather, at that time, it could still be special. But then, there has always been something magical about photography.

The first photographers in the nineteenth century probably felt this way, even before they fully understood how it worked. A picture appears and becomes clear on its own. You can stand in a dark room and watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photo.

Even when you know how it works, it still feels mysterious. That feeling never goes away. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t completely surprise me.",,,
313,"Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake within a year of his and Lois's moving in. A possession which can only be afforded by the exercise of stringent and calculated economy is best not afforded at all. But at the time it had seemed a sensible, as well as a desirable, move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand. It was Lois who had argued the more strongly for a move, but he had put up little resistance to arguments which at the time had seemed compelling: the flat wasn't really suitable for a family, they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these, of course, could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. Mornington Mansions had never been an acceptable address for an up-and-coming young barrister and a successful businesswoman. She never said it without a sense that even speaking the words subtly diminished her standing, socially and economically.
Lois had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise. The overcrowded tube journey, stayed in a mood of envious resentment, had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He would recall his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner from the kitchen, his grandmother's insistence that the returning breadwinner, tired from his exhausting day in court, should be given peace, a little gentle cosseting, and relief from every petty domestic anxiety. She had been a 'lawyer's wife', indefatigable in legal good causes, elegantly present at all lawyers' functions, apparently content with the sphere of life which she had made her own. Well, that world had passed for ever. Lois had made it plain before their marriage that her career was as important as his. It hardly needed saying, this was, after all, a modern marriage. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.
Venetia must have come straight from the court to their offices and she had been in a dangerous mood. Something or someone had upset her. But the word 'upset' was too weak, too bland for the intensity of furious disgust with which she had confronted him. Someone had driven her to the limit of her endurance. He cursed himself. If he hadn't been in his room, if he'd only left a minute earlier, the encounter wouldn't have taken place, she would have had the night to think it over, to consider what, if anything, she ought to do. Probably nothing. The morning might have brought sense. He remembered every word of her angry accusations.
'I defended Brian Cartwright today. Successfully. He told me that when you were his counsel four years ago you knew before trial that he had bribed three of the jury. You did nothing. You went on with the case. Is that true?'
'He's lying. It isn't true.'
'He also said that he passed over some shares in his company to your fiancee. Also before trial. Is that true?'
'I tell you, he's lying. None of its true.'
The denial had been as instinctive as an arm raised to ward off a blow and had sounded unconvincing even to his own ears. His whole action had been one of guilt. The first cold horror draining his face was succeeded by a hot flush, bringing back shameful memories of his headmaster's study, of the terror of the inevitable punishment. He had made himself look into her eyes and had seen the look of contemptuous disbelief. If only he'd had some warning. He knew now what he should have said: 'Cartwright told me after the trial but I didn't believe him. I don't believe him now. That man will say anything to make himself important.'
But he had told a more direct, more dangerous lie, and she had known that it was a lie. Even so, why the anger, why the disgust? What was that old misdemeanour to do with her? Who had sent Venetia Aldridge to be guardian of the conscience of their legal practice? Or of his, come to that? Was her own conscience so clear, her behaviour in court always immaculate? Was she justified in destroying his career? And it would be destruction. He wasn't sure what exactly she could do, how far she was prepared to go, but if this got about, even as a rumour, he was done for.",C2,,,"Simon Costello knew that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake after living there for a year. If you can only buy something by being very careful with money, maybe you shouldn't buy it at all. But at the time, it seemed like a good idea. He had won several court cases recently and kept getting new ones. Lois went back to her job at the advertising company two months after their twins were born, and she got a pay rise to thirty-five thousand pounds. Lois really wanted to move house, and he agreed. Their flat was too small for a family. They needed more space, a garden, and a room for an au pair. Of course, they could have found these things in a cheaper area, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt their old address, Mornington Mansions, wasn't good enough for a successful lawyer and businesswoman. Just saying the name made her feel less important.

Lois decided that to save money, one of them should take public transport to work. Her office was far across London, so she said Simon should be the one to save money. His crowded tube journey became thirty minutes each day when he felt angry and thought about his problems. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead from his childhood. He remembered the smell of food cooking and how his grandmother always made sure his grandfather had a quiet, comfortable evening after a hard day in court. She was a 'lawyer's wife' who supported her husband and went to all his work events. But that time was over. Lois had said before they married that her job was as important as his. Of course, this is normal in a modern marriage. Her job was important to her and to both of them. The house, the au pair, and their way of life needed both their salaries. Now, everything they had worked for could be ruined by Venetia, who thought she was always right.

Venetia must have come straight from the court to his office, and she was very angry. Something or someone had made her extremely upset. He wished he hadn't been in his room. If he had left just one minute earlier, he wouldn't have met her. She would have had the night to think about what to do, and maybe she would have decided to do nothing. The next day, she might have been calmer. He remembered every word she said to him angrily.

""I defended Brian Cartwright today, and I won. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he paid money to three people on the jury. You did nothing. You still did the case. Is that true?""

""He's lying. It isn't true.""

""He also said he gave some shares in his company to your fiancée. Also before the trial. Is that true?""

""I'm telling you, he's lying. None of it is true.""

Saying no was like putting up his arm to stop a hit, and it didn't sound believable, even to him. He knew he looked guilty. First, his face went pale, then it turned red. It reminded him of being in trouble at school, waiting for punishment. He looked into her eyes and saw she didn't believe him. He wished he had known she was coming. He knew what he should have said: ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. That man will say anything to feel important.""

But instead, he told a clear and dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry and disgusted? What did this old problem have to do with her? Who made Venetia the person who decides what is right in their work? Was she always perfect in court? Did she have the right to ruin his career? And it would ruin him. He didn't know exactly what she could do or how far she would go, but if people heard about this, even as a story, his career would be over.","Simon Costello realised that buying the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois.

She never said this directly, but she felt that even mentioning their old home made her seem less important socially and financially.

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production, and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results.
All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Too Much Choice

Society is becoming 'overchoiced'. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins.
Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep track of.

McAndrews Hotel

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition, instigated by my grandmother, and by now it has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting. Such respect for dignity and personal privacy is hard to come by in commercial establishments these days.",C2,,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in 50 years. Thirty years ago, there were not many star maps. Telescopes were not very good. There were only a few books about astronomy. Now, you can buy many kinds of telescopes. Computers and calculators have changed how we make star maps.

This is a good time for people who like astronomy. But some things are worse. Now, you might have to drive 80 kilometers to see a dark sky. In the day, the sky has many white lines from planes. These lines stay for hours and become clouds. This makes it hard to look at the sun. It also makes it hard to look at the stars at night.

**Too Many Choices**

Today, we have too many choices. There are too many things to do. There are too many things to buy. People always want new phones and new things. Technology makes new things come very fast. When one new thing comes, another new thing is ready. This makes you feel tired.

People say choice is good. But more choice can make you feel stressed. It makes life difficult. Now, some people want a simple life. They want simple things that are important. But it is hard to live a simple life. There are too many kinds of soap. There are too many kinds of cereal. There are too many phone plans.

It can make you feel tired and confused, and you can feel disconnected from real life.

Choice is very important in the new economy, but more choice also means more stress, less time, and more difficulty. Because of this, a new idea is becoming popular. People are looking for 'simplexity' – the simple things that are important in our complicated world. But it is not easy to make your life simple when there is so much to buy. There are more types of washing powder and breakfast cereal than we need. There are more software updates, phone plans, and special features than we can remember.

315,"The Actor's Craft

Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they're compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' But instead they all too easily fall into ponderous cliches, silly truisms or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. We should all pay heed to what Paul Scofield said in a letter to a friend of mine: 'I have found that an actor's work has life and interest only in its execution. It seems to wither away in discussion and become emptily theoretical and insubstantial. It has no rules (except perhaps audibility). With every play and every playwright the actor starts from scratch, as if he or she knows nothing and proceeds to learn afresh every time growing with the relationships of the characters and the insights of the writer. When the play has finished its run, he's empty until the next time. And its the emptiness which is, I find, apparent in any discussion of theatre work.'

A review of Hamlet

Adrian Lester's Hamlet is poised precariously between boyhood and manhood, and it is a performance of thrilling simplicity and assurance. His handling of the text and his physical and psychological self-control take him, in one leap, from brilliantly promising to frontline player: an actor with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing. Lester plays an edgy, tetchy young man who feeds on a banked-down sense of anger, agile, watchful and driven, he deploys a sense of acid wit and generous humour that makes him both formidable and lovable. Although played down, the virtuosity of this performance is unmistakable. Observe Lester's body, the way his arms hang stiffly, giving you a sense of a figure waiting to be animated. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives you a similar feeling of a body being moved by an inner force that he both knows and does not know. So what is acting? What is behaviour? Is the former an imitation or an evocation of the latter? Who and what animates these bodies, morally and physically? That is the central question about the life of the theatre.

One director's approach to rehearsal

The first stage of this director's rehearsal process is known as 'dropping in', a procedure which goes something like this. The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, finding out what effect the words are having. When if is their turn to speak, they glance of the screen, digest the first phrase, think about what it means to them, wait to find the impulse - the reason to speak - then speak. For example, the line is, 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?; Breathe. Let the thought drop in with your breath. A memory, a vision, an impression. Some people will imagine a queue, maybe at a bus stop on the way to rehearsals or for a rock concert in their youth. Having visualised the scene, find the impulse to speak it - what this director calls 'The pathway to the line'. Impulses can come from without or within. Look in the eyes of the other actor listening. Consider your character's situation. This director talks of 'dropping in' as a means of finding out what is going on. Don't pre-plan or pre-judge. Dare to go down there with an empty mind and trust that something will happen to you.

The Perfect Theatre

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. Going to the theatre, going to any live performance, is an event and the staff need to have a sense of that, too. It's terribly alienating if you feel that its just any old job for the people working front of house.
The theatre itself needs to create a relationship between the performer and the audience - no one in the audience should feel that they're getting an unreasonably prejudiced view of the actor. It's important that they're not too far away, they can hear, they can see, they can feel in some sense in contact with what's going on on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it because you can't deny the human form at the heart of drama. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage.
I like theatres that have a sense of the past in them. Like worn stone steps in a church, you get the sense of layers of human presence. From the point of view of the plays, you can't have something for everybody. You cant second-guess an audience because they don't know what they're going to want to see. When you visit the theatre, you want something done in a way you can't imagine, otherwise you may as well have stayed at home.",C2,,"**The Actor's Job**

Sometimes people laugh at actors or do not like them. Actors sometimes cause this problem. Their film or theatre companies ask them to talk about their job in interviews. They should do what the famous dancer Pavlova did. A man asked her what her dancing meant. She said, ""If I could tell you, I would not dance it."" But actors often use old, boring words. Or they talk about silly, personal stories. We should listen to the actor Paul Scofield. He said an actor's job is only interesting when you watch it. Talking about it makes it seem boring. There are no rules for acting. For every new play, an actor must start learning again. They learn about the people in the play and the writer's ideas. When the play ends, the actor feels empty until the next job. This emptiness is why it is hard to talk about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet. His Hamlet is between a boy and a man. It is a very simple and good performance. He says the words very well. He also controls his body and feelings very well. This makes him a very good actor. He is smart and sure of himself but does not try to be the center of attention. Lester plays a young man who is often angry and worried. He is quick, watches everything, and tries very hard. He is also funny. This makes him strong and nice. You can see he is very skilled. Look at his body. His arms hang in a stiff way. He looks like a person waiting to start moving. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio. He also makes you feel something is moving his body from inside. So, what is acting? Is it copying how people act? Or is it making you feel something? Who makes these bodies move and think? This is the big question in theatre.

**How One Director Practices**

This director's first step is called 'dropping in'. This is how it works. The stage manager shows the play's words on a screen. The actors sit quietly when others talk. They listen to how the words make them feel. When it is their time to talk, they look at the screen. They read the first words. They think about what the words mean to them. They wait for a feeling - a reason to talk - and then they talk. For example, the words are, ""We waited in line all night in the rain, do you remember?"" The actor breathes. They let a thought come with their breath. It could be a memory or a picture. Some people will think of a line of people, maybe for a bus or for a music show when they were young. After they see the picture, they find the feeling to say the words. The director calls this 'The way to the words'. The feeling can come from outside or inside. Look at the other actor who is listening. Think about your character's life. The director says 'dropping in' helps you understand what is happening. Do not decide what you will do before. Be brave and start with an empty mind. Believe that something will happen to you.

**The Perfect Theatre**

A perfect theatre should make you feel important. It should feel like you being there changes the show. Going to the theatre is a special thing. The people who work there should think this too. It feels bad if you think the staff see their job as just normal work.

The theatre building must help the actors and the people watching feel connected. No one watching should feel they have a bad seat. It is important that people are not too far from the stage. They must be able to hear, see, and feel near to the play. The size of the theatre is important. It must be good for the human voice and body. If a theatre makes people look very small, it is bad. You must remember that the human body is the most important part of a play. Many old theatres from a long time ago were good. They built theatres that felt close to the stage.

I like theatres that feel old. Like old stone steps in a church, you can feel that many people have been there. You cannot have a play that everyone will like. You cannot know what people will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and different. If you could think of it at home, you should have stayed there.","The Actor's Work

Sometimes, people make fun of actors or don't respect them. Often, this happens because actors have to talk about their work in interviews for their films or plays. They should do what the famous dancer Pavlova did. When a man asked her what her dancing meant, she said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" But actors often use boring, common phrases or talk about silly gossip. We should listen to what the actor Paul Scofield once wrote: ""An actor's work is only interesting when you see it being done. Talking about it makes it seem empty and without rules. For every new play, the actor must start learning from the beginning, as if they know nothing. They learn by understanding the characters and the writer's ideas. When the play ends, the actor feels empty until the next job. And this emptiness is clear when you try to talk about theatre work.""

A Review of Hamlet

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man who is not quite a boy and not quite an adult. It is a simple and confident performance. He speaks the words very well and has great control of his body and feelings. This makes him a very important actor. He plays Hamlet as an angry, nervous, and clever young man. He is funny in a sharp way but also kind, which makes you like him and also respect him. You can see his great skill as an actor. Look at how he stands, with his arms stiff, like a person waiting to come to life. The actor playing Horatio gives a similar feeling, as if a force inside him is making him move. So, what is acting? Is it copying how people behave, or is it making you feel something? Who makes these actors' bodies move and think? This is the main question in theatre.

One Director's Way of Rehearsing

This director's first step in rehearsal is called 'dropping in'. This is how it works. The stage manager shows the words of the play on a screen. The actors sit quietly and listen when others are speaking, to understand how the words make them feel. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, read the first sentence, and think about what it means to them. They wait for a feeling, a reason to speak, and then they speak. For example, the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" The actor breathes and lets a thought come with their breath. It could be a memory or a picture in their mind. Some people might imagine a queue for a bus or for a concert when they were young. After they see this scene in their mind, they find the feeling to speak the line. The director calls this 'The pathway to the line'. This feeling can come from outside or from inside yourself. Look at the other actor who is listening. Think about your character's life. The director says 'dropping in' helps you find out what is happening. Don't plan everything before. Be brave, start with an empty mind, and believe that something will happen.

The Perfect Theatre

A perfect theatre should make you feel that you are important for being there. Going to the theatre is a special event, and the staff should act like it is special too. It feels bad if you think the staff are just doing a normal job and don't care.
The theatre building must help the actors and the audience feel connected. No one in the audience should feel they have a bad view of the stage. It is important that people are not too far away, that they can hear, see, and feel close to what is happening on stage. The size and shape of the theatre are important. It must work well for the human voice and the human body. If a theatre makes people look very small, it is wrong, because the human body is the most important part of a play. Many theatres built a long time ago were good because the audience area felt like it was holding the stage.
I like theatres that feel old. Like old stone steps in a church, you can feel that many people have been there before. You cannot have a play that everyone will like. You cannot guess what an audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something you could not imagine yourself. If not, you might as well have stayed at home.","**The Actor's Work**

Actors often receive mockery and disrespect. They sometimes add to this problem themselves. Their film or theatre companies make them talk about their work in interviews, and they often do this badly. They should copy the dancer Pavlova. When someone asked her what her dancing meant, she answered, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't need to dance it."" But instead, actors often use boring, common phrases or get involved in silly gossip. We should listen to what the actor Paul Scofield once wrote: ""An actor's work is only alive and interesting while it is being performed. Talking about it makes it seem weak and too theoretical. It has no real rules, except that you must be heard. With every new play, the actor starts from the beginning, as if they know nothing. They learn everything again, growing with the characters and the writer's ideas. When the play ends, the actor feels empty until the next one starts. This emptiness is clear in any discussion about theatre.""

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's Hamlet is caught between being a boy and a man. It is a performance that is thrillingly simple and confident. His control of the language and his control of his body and emotions quickly show he is a leading actor. He is smart and confident enough to not show off. Lester plays a nervous, easily annoyed young man who is full of hidden anger. He is quick, watchful, and determined. He uses sharp, clever humour and a kind, funny side that makes his character both powerful and easy to like. Even though it is not showy, the great skill in his performance is obvious. Look at Lester's body, how his arms hang stiffly. It makes you feel he is a person waiting to come to life. Handy, who plays Horatio, gives a similar feeling of a body moved by a force inside him. This makes us ask important questions: What is acting? Is it copying behaviour or creating a feeling of it? Who, or what, brings these characters to life, in their mind and body? This is the main question about theatre.

**One Director's Rehearsal Method**

The first step in this director's rehearsal is called 'dropping in'. This is how it works. The stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors sit quietly while another actor speaks, feeling the effect of the words. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the first few words, and consider what they mean to them. They wait for an impulse—a real reason to speak—and then they speak. For example, the line is: ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" The actor breathes. They let a thought come with their breath. It could be a memory, a picture, or a feeling. Some people will imagine a queue, maybe for a bus on the way to rehearsal or for a concert when they were young. After they see this scene in their mind, they find the impulse to speak the line—what the director calls 'The pathway to the line'. Impulses can come from outside or inside. They might look into the eyes of the other actor who is listening. They might think about their character's situation. The director says 'dropping in' is a way to discover what is really happening. Actors should not plan their reactions in advance. They must be brave enough to start with an empty mind and believe that something will happen.

**The Ideal Theatre**

A perfect theatre should make you feel that your being there matters. Going to the theatre, or any live show, is a special event, and the staff should also feel this. It feels very cold and unfriendly if you think the staff see it as just a normal job. The theatre building must help create a connection between the performer and the audience. No one in the audience should feel they have a bad view of the stage. It is very important that they are not too far away, that they can hear, they can see, and they can feel some connection to what is happening on stage. The size and shape of the auditorium are important. It must work well with the human voice and the size of a human body. If a theatre makes the actors look very small, it is a bad design, because the human body is the most important part of drama. Many theatres from the late 1800s were good because they built auditoriums that felt connected to the stage. I like theatres that have a feeling of the past. Like old, worn stone steps in a church, they give you a sense of all the people who have been there before. You cannot make a play that everyone will like. You cannot guess what an audience will want to see, because they don't know themselves. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something done in a way you could not have imagined. If not, you might as well have stayed at home.","The Actor's Craft

Actors often face mockery and disrespect. A great deal of this criticism is brought about by the actors themselves, when film or theatre companies require them to talk about their profession in interviews. They should follow the example of the dancer Pavlova, who, when asked what her dancing expressed, answered: ""If I could explain it, I wouldn't need to dance it."" Yet they frequently use overly serious clichés, meaningless statements, or get drawn into sensational gossip. We should remember what Paul Scofield wrote to a friend: ""I have discovered that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when it is being performed. It loses its power when talked about, becoming theoretical and without substance. It has no rules, except perhaps the need to be heard. With every new play and playwright, the actor starts from the beginning, as if knowing nothing, and learns again, developing through the characters' relationships and the writer's understanding. When the play's season ends, the actor feels empty until the next one. And it is this emptiness, I believe, that becomes obvious in any conversation about theatre.""

A Review of Hamlet

Adrian Lester's Hamlet is positioned carefully between youth and adulthood, and it is a performance of impressive simplicity and confidence. His understanding of the language and his control over his body and emotions quickly establish him as a leading actor—one whose smart self-assurance allows him to be almost modest. Lester plays a nervous, easily annoyed young man who is driven by hidden anger. He is quick, observant, and determined, using sharp humour and a warm sense of fun that makes his character both powerful and likeable. Although it is not showy, the great skill of his performance is clear. Watch Lester's body, how his arms hang rigidly, creating the impression of a person ready to come to life. Handy's performance as Horatio gives a similar feeling of a body guided by an inner energy that he partly understands and partly does not. This makes us ask important questions: What is acting? What is behaviour? Is acting a copy or a representation of behaviour? Who, or what, brings these bodies to life, in both a moral and physical sense? This is the central question about the nature of theatre.

One Director's Approach to Rehearsal

The first step in this director's rehearsal method is called 'dropping in'. It works like this. The stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors sit quietly while another person is speaking, noticing how the words affect them. When it is their time to speak, they look at the screen, understand the first part of the text, think about what it means to them personally, and wait for the motivation—the reason to speak—before they say the line. For example, the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" Breathe. Let the idea come to you as you breathe. It could be a memory, a picture, a feeling. Some people will see a queue, perhaps at a bus stop on the way to rehearsals, or for a concert when they were young. After imagining the situation, find the motivation to speak the line—what this director names 'The pathway to the line'. Motivation can come from outside you or from inside. Look at the other actor who is listening. Think about your character's position. This director describes 'dropping in' as a way to discover what is really happening. Do not prepare too much or make decisions in advance. Be brave enough to approach it with an open mind and believe that something will occur to you.

The Perfect Theatre

The perfect theatre should make you feel that your attendance has had an impact. Going to the theatre, or to any live show, is a special occasion, and the staff should also recognise this. It is very isolating if you get the impression that the front-of-house employees see their work as just an ordinary job. The theatre building needs to establish a relationship between the performer and the audience. Nobody in the audience should feel they are getting an unfairly limited view of the actors. It is essential that they are not seated too far back, that they can hear clearly, see properly, and feel somewhat connected to the action on stage. The size and shape of the auditorium are very important. It must be suited to the human voice and the size of the human body. If an auditorium makes a person seem small, then it is flawed, because you cannot ignore the human form, which is central to drama. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century succeeded because they created an auditorium that felt connected to the stage. I prefer theatres that have a feeling of history. Like worn stone steps in a church, you sense the many people who have been there before. Regarding the choice of plays, you cannot please everyone. You cannot predict what an audience will want because they themselves may not know what they want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something presented in a way you could not have predicted; otherwise, you might just as well have remained at home.",
316,"Joanna's Lessons

Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano?

Even a member of that mythical species, the completely tone deaf, could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Simply to see her zipping around a keyboard grabbing fistfuls of notes at the behest of some unfeasible contemporary score is to watch a pianist pushing the human frame to its limits.
But even her dazzling virtuosity was not enough to was one small boy at a recent concert she gave for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he had been cascaded with bits and bobs of pieces in every style from her vast repertoire of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African, etc. He'd coolly watched her dive under the lid of the concert grand to pluck the wires - normally a surefire knockout for kids. Then as she drew breath and invited questions, he piped up: 'Can you play Match of the Day?'
How many veterans of the concert hall platform would be floored by such a request? For Joanna MacGregor, though, it was simply a hoot. 'In his eyes, until I played that, I hadn't passed the test. I wasn't a proper pianist.' Needless to say, she sailed through and doubtless logged the experience for her next children's recital.
MacGregor is rare among top-flight concert pianists for the interest she takes in how young children learn the instrument. She has just published her own elementary piano tutor for children: Joanna MacGregor's Piano World. And she has managed it despite a crippling work schedule.
There hardly seems to be a festival this summer she is not gracing. Tomorrow she is in the thick of an all-day collaboration between nine young composers and artists. She runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. And by her own admission, she cannot meet an artist of any sort without being tempted to suggest a joint project. So why on earth take on the extra burden of writing a book?
'People who know me are clearly surprised. But I think the very first lessons are absolutely crucial. It says a lot about the music profession that we tend to concentrate on the top end, on this idea of the child as nascent virtuoso. Most people's interest in music is much more ordinary and everyday. I find that far more interesting!'
In producing the first three books, MacGregor is drawing on vivid experience. Between the ages of 18 and 25, before she was getting concert engagements as a pianist, she taught a stream of beginners the piano. But most important in her make-up now as a musician who is unsurpassed in the breadth of her eclectic repertoire was the endless procession of small boys and girls traipsing into her childhood home, where her mother taught the piano.
'Not only was I fiddling around at the keyboard, but there were all these other children of all backgrounds wanting to play every sort of music - bits of classical, jazz, pop, improvisation. I wasn't part of that hothouse thing of forcing exceptional talent. I grew up with the idea of trying to make music available to people of all abilities.'
Just as everyone should be able to learn how to swim or to speak a smattering of French, so, in her view, should everybody be able to make a stab at learning the piano. Some kids have a flair and make rapid progress. She is fascinated by the others: those who chug along at varying rates of progress, enjoying it for a while, but all too often giving up. This falling off happens at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too frustrating. Others rebel further down the line when the stakes get higher and parental pressure is driving them 'to be like those children on the telly.'
'I worry that some people use music, like sport, as a way of making their children achieve things, rather than just saying: it's music, it's there to enjoy. The reason children fall by the wayside is because they feel they are not going to match up to their parents' expectations.
The production of her own training manual begs an obvious question. Does she have a poor opinion of the existing corpus of tutor books, or indeed of the general quality of piano teaching? 'I'm very reluctant to criticise other people's teaching or others' tutor books,' she says. What she does do is readily accept that her books, colourful and eye-catching though they are, are by no means the only books on the market designed to make the first steps enjoyable.
Her own special wheeze for luring these neophytes, the fives, sixes and sevens, through those bewildering times is to weave a storyline into the books and their accompanying CDs. The challenge at this fragile stage is to make the work interesting. And so, from lesson one, there are accompaniments in a variety of styles for teacher - or parent - to play beneath a child's line. For kids whose parents aren't pianists the accompaniments are recorded on the CDs. Learning should be unadulterated fun, MacGregor insists.
'You have to allow them to improvise and give them a reason to play at either end of the keyboard and on the black notes and use the pedals.' As progress is made, bigger obstacles loom. Children need to be coaxed quite hard to read the music rather than rely on ear. Having relied for so much of her own childhood on her very keen ear, MacGregor has considerable sympathy on this score.
But she believes the single most important factor is practice. How can children be persuaded to play a passage even once again, let alone many times over? She admits to not having practised rigorously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she began building up a contemporary repertoire whose formidable difficulties demanded practice. Now she loves it. The eight hours a day that she gets through are the core of her musical life, she says, more important than performances.
'I have enormous sympathy with people who find it difficult. I don't think people talk about it enough.' The secret, whether you do it for twenty minutes or five hours, is to work out beforehand what it is you are aiming to do, she says. Other tips: treat yourself - play the whole piece through, however many wrong notes. And mix hard with easy.",C2,"Joanna is a piano player. She plays music for people. She is very busy. But she also writes books for children. The books help children learn the piano.

One day, a boy asked Joanna to play a song from TV. She played it for him. The boy was happy.

Joanna thinks it is important for all children to learn music. She wants learning to be fun. She remembers when she was a child. Her mother taught piano to many children at their home. Joanna saw children of all abilities. She thinks music is for everyone, not just the best players.

Some children stop learning piano. They feel it is too hard. Or they feel their parents want them to be the best. Joanna wants children to enjoy music, not just to be good at it.

Her new books have stories and pictures. They come with CDs. The CDs have music for parents to play. Joanna says learning the piano should be fun. Children should try all the keys and pedals.

She knows it is hard to practice. But practice is important. She says to play a little every day. Play easy songs and hard songs. And remember to have fun.","Joanna is a busy concert pianist. So why is she writing books for young children learning the piano?

Even someone who is not musical can enjoy Joanna's playing. It is exciting to watch her play the piano very fast. She plays many kinds of music like classical, jazz, and pop.

At a concert for children, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play the Match of the Day music?"" Many pianists would not know what to do. But Joanna thought it was funny. She played the music for him. She said that in his eyes, she had to play it to be a real pianist.

Joanna is special because she cares about how children learn the piano. She has written a new piano book for children. She did this even though she is very busy with her work.

Why did she write a book? Joanna thinks the first lessons are very important. She says that music is for everyone, not just for children who are very talented. She finds everyday music more interesting.

When Joanna was younger, she taught piano to beginners. Her mother also taught piano at home when Joanna was a child. Many children came to their house to learn. They played all kinds of music. Joanna believes that everyone should be able to try to learn the piano, just like everyone can try to swim or learn a little French.

Some children learn quickly. Others learn more slowly and sometimes stop. Joanna worries that some parents want their children to be the best, like children on TV. She thinks children stop playing because they feel they cannot meet their parents' hopes.

Her new books have stories and come with CDs. She wants learning to be fun from the first lesson. The books have music for the teacher or parent to play with the child. If a parent cannot play, they can use the CD.

Joanna says children should be allowed to play all over the piano and use the pedals. She knows it can be hard for children to learn to read music. She found it hard too when she was young.

She believes practice is the most important thing. She says you should know what you want to do before you practice. Play the whole piece, even with wrong notes. And play both easy and hard pieces.","Joanna MacGregor is a very busy concert pianist. So why did she decide to write piano books for young children?

Even someone who can't tell one musical note from another would enjoy her playing. Watching her move her hands quickly across the piano keys during a difficult modern piece shows how hard she works.

But one small boy at a children's concert was not impressed by her amazing skill. He listened to her play many kinds of music - classical, jazz, blues, and more. He watched calmly as she reached inside the piano to pluck the strings, which usually excites children. Then, when she asked for questions, he said: ""Can you play the Match of the Day theme song?""

Many concert pianists would not know what to do. But Joanna thought it was funny. She said, ""In his opinion, I wasn't a real pianist until I played that song."" Of course, she played it easily and will probably use it in her next children's concert.

MacGregor is unusual because she cares about how children learn piano. She just published her own beginner piano book for children, called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" She did this even though she has a very busy work schedule.

She is performing at almost every music festival this summer. She also has her own music recording company. She loves working with other artists. So why did she take on the extra work of writing a book?

""People who know me are surprised,"" she says. ""But I believe the first lessons are very important. The music world often focuses only on the best students, the child prodigies. But most people enjoy music in a normal, everyday way. I find that much more interesting!""

She used her own experiences to write the first three books. When she was younger, from 18 to 25, she taught many beginners. Also, when she was a child, her mother was a piano teacher. Many different children came to her house to learn.

""I was always playing the piano, and there were other children from all backgrounds who wanted to play all kinds of music - classical, jazz, pop, and making up their own tunes. I didn't grow up in a high-pressure environment. I believe music should be for everyone, no matter their ability.""

She thinks everyone should have the chance to try to learn the piano, just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little of another language. Some children are very talented and learn quickly. But she is also interested in the children who learn more slowly, enjoy it for a while, but often stop. Children can quit at any stage. Some find the beginning too hard. Others stop later when their parents push them to be like the talented children they see on television.

""I worry that some parents use music, like sports, to make their children achieve things, instead of just saying: music is here to enjoy. Children often stop because they feel they can't meet their parents' expectations.""

Since she wrote her own teaching book, does she think other piano books or teaching methods are bad? ""I don't want to criticise other teachers or their books,"" she says. She admits that her books, which are bright and colourful, are not the only ones designed to make learning fun.

Her special idea to help young beginners is to include a story in the books and on the CDs. The challenge is to make the work interesting from the very first lesson. So, from lesson one, there are accompaniments in different styles for the teacher or parent to play along with the child's part. For children whose parents don't play, the accompaniments are on the CDs. MacGregor believes learning should be pure fun.

""You have to let them make up their own music and give them a reason to play at both ends of the keyboard, on the black notes, and use the pedals."" As children get better, they face bigger challenges. They need encouragement to read music instead of just playing by ear. MacGregor understands this well because she also relied on her good ear when she was young.

But she thinks the most important thing is practice. How can you persuade a child to play a piece one more time, not to mention many times? She admits she didn't practice seriously until she went to music college. There, she started learning difficult modern music that required a lot of practice. Now she loves to practice. She says the eight hours a day she spends practicing are the most important part of her musical life, more important than performances.

""I understand people who find it difficult to practice. I don't think people talk about this enough."" Her secret is to decide what you want to achieve before you start, whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours. Other tips: Be kind to yourself - play the whole piece, even if you make mistakes. And mix hard pieces with easy ones.","Joanna MacGregor leads an extremely busy life as a concert pianist. So why has she chosen to write books for young children who are learning the piano?

Even someone who cannot distinguish one note from another would be impressed by Joanna MacGregor’s performance. Simply watching her move rapidly across the piano keys, performing complex contemporary music, shows a musician working at the limits of her physical ability.

However, even her remarkable skill failed to satisfy one young boy at a recent children’s concert. Like the rest of the audience, he had listened to short pieces in many different styles from her extensive repertoire—classical, jazz, blues, and more. He calmly observed her reaching inside the piano to pluck the strings, something that usually fascinates children. Then, when she paused and invited questions, he asked: ""Can you play the Match of the Day theme?""

Many experienced concert pianists would be confused by such a request. For Joanna MacGregor, however, it was simply amusing. ""In his view, until I played that tune, I hadn’t proved myself. I wasn’t a real pianist."" Naturally, she performed it effortlessly and will likely include the idea in her next children’s concert.

MacGregor is unusual among leading concert pianists because of her interest in how children learn the instrument. She has recently published her own beginner piano book for children: Joanna MacGregor’s Piano World. She managed this despite her demanding work schedule.

She seems to be performing at nearly every music festival this summer. Tomorrow she is deeply involved in an all-day project with nine young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She admits that whenever she meets an artist, she is tempted to start a joint project. So why take on the additional responsibility of writing a book?

""People who know me are certainly surprised. But I believe the first lessons are absolutely essential. The music profession often concentrates only on the most talented children, the potential future stars. However, most people’s interest in music is much more ordinary and everyday. I find that far more interesting!""

In creating these first three books, MacGregor draws on her own vivid experiences. Between the ages of 18 and 25, before she began performing as a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. But the most significant influence was the constant stream of children who came to her childhood home for piano lessons with her mother.

""I was always experimenting at the piano, and there were all these other children from various backgrounds who wanted to play every kind of music—classical, jazz, pop, and improvisation. I wasn’t part of that intense environment that pushes exceptional talent. I grew up believing that music should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability.""

She believes that just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, everyone should also have the opportunity to try learning the piano. Some children have a natural talent and progress quickly. She is particularly fascinated by the others: those who advance at different speeds, enjoy it for a while, but frequently give up. This can happen at any stage. Some find the initial steps too frustrating. Others rebel later when expectations increase and parents pressure them ""to be like the children on television.""

""I’m concerned that some people use music, like sport, as a way to make their children accomplish things, rather than simply saying: it’s music, it’s meant to be enjoyed. Children give up because they feel they cannot meet their parents’ expectations.""

By writing her own teaching book, she raises an obvious question. Does she think existing piano books, or piano teaching in general, is inadequate? ""I am very hesitant to criticise other teachers or their books,"" she says. She readily admits that her books, although colourful and attractive, are certainly not the only ones designed to make the first steps enjoyable.

Her special approach for guiding young beginners, aged five to seven, through this confusing stage is to include a storyline in the books and on the accompanying CDs. The main challenge at this early point is to keep the work interesting. Therefore, from the very first lesson, there are accompaniments in various styles for the teacher or parent to play along with the child’s part. For children whose parents are not pianists, the accompaniments are recorded on the CDs. MacGregor insists that learning should be pure fun.

""You must allow them to improvise and give them a reason to play at both ends of the keyboard, use the black notes, and try the pedals."" As they progress, greater challenges appear. Children need strong encouragement to read music instead of relying only on their ear. Because she depended heavily on her own excellent ear as a child, MacGregor has a lot of understanding about this.

However, she believes the single most important factor is practice. How can you persuade a child to play a passage even one more time, let alone many times? She confesses that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music. There, she began building a contemporary repertoire whose significant difficulties required dedicated practice. Now she loves it. She says the hours she spends practicing each day are the foundation of her musical life, more important than performances.

""I have great sympathy for people who find it difficult. I don't think this is discussed enough."" The secret, whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, is to plan beforehand what you want to achieve. Other advice: reward yourself—play the entire piece, even with mistakes. And combine difficult pieces with easier ones.","Joanna MacGregor maintains a demanding schedule as a concert pianist, so what has motivated her to take on the additional responsibility of writing instructional books for young piano students?

Even someone with no musical ability whatsoever could not help but be captivated by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Merely observing her navigate the keyboard with remarkable speed, executing complex contemporary compositions, provides a glimpse of a musician testing physical limits.

Yet even her extraordinary technical skill failed to fully satisfy one young audience member at a recent children's concert. Like others present, he had been treated to diverse musical excerpts drawn from her extensive repertoire spanning classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, and world music. He remained unimpressed even when she reached inside the grand piano to manipulate the strings—typically a guaranteed success with younger listeners. When she paused for questions, he immediately inquired: ""Can you play the Match of the Day theme?""

Many established concert artists might have been disconcerted by such a request, but MacGregor found it genuinely amusing. ""In his view,"" she noted, ""until I played that piece, I hadn't proven myself as a real pianist."" Naturally, she performed it flawlessly and will likely incorporate the piece into future children's recitals.

MacGregor stands out among elite concert pianists for her dedication to understanding how children learn music. She has recently published her own introductory piano method for children, accomplished despite an overwhelming professional schedule.

Her festival appearances this summer are numerous, and tomorrow she participates in an intensive collaborative project involving nine composers and visual artists. She also manages her own record label, and confesses she frequently proposes joint ventures when meeting other artists. Given these commitments, why would she assume the extra work of authoring a book?

""Those who know me have expressed surprise,"" she acknowledges. ""However, I believe initial music instruction is fundamentally important. The music profession often focuses excessively on exceptional talent and virtuosity, whereas most people engage with music in more ordinary ways. I find this ordinary engagement far more compelling.""

In developing her instructional materials, MacGregor draws on substantial teaching experience. Before establishing her concert career between ages 18 and 25, she taught numerous beginning piano students. Most influential, however, was her childhood exposure to the steady stream of students taught by her mother at their family home.

""While I was experimenting at the keyboard, I observed children from diverse backgrounds wanting to play various musical styles—classical excerpts, jazz, popular music, improvisation. My upbringing wasn't about pushing prodigious talent, but rather about making music accessible to students of all capability levels.""

She maintains that piano instruction should be as universally available as basic swimming lessons or introductory language classes. While some students display natural aptitude and advance quickly, she remains equally interested in those who progress at varying rates, often enjoying music temporarily before discontinuing lessons. This attrition occurs at different stages—some beginners find initial challenges overwhelming, while others resist when expectations intensify and parental pressure mounts to emulate television child prodigies.

""I'm concerned that some parents approach music, like sports, as another achievement metric rather than presenting it as pure enjoyment. Many children discontinue lessons because they feel unable to meet parental expectations.""

Her decision to create teaching materials raises an inevitable question: does she find existing piano methods or general teaching standards inadequate? ""I'm hesitant to criticize others' teaching approaches or published methods,"" she responds. While her books feature vibrant visuals, she acknowledges they represent just one of many available options designed to make early musical exposure enjoyable.

Her distinctive approach for engaging young beginners involves incorporating narrative elements throughout the books and accompanying recordings. The primary challenge at this foundational stage involves maintaining student interest. Consequently, from the very first lesson, arrangements include accompaniments in diverse styles for teachers or parents to play alongside the student's part. Recorded accompaniments accommodate non-pianist parents. MacGregor emphasizes that learning should remain fundamentally enjoyable.

""Students should have opportunities to improvise, explore the keyboard's full range, experiment with black keys, and utilize pedals."" As students advance, more significant challenges emerge. Children often require considerable encouragement to read notation rather than relying solely on auditory skills. Having depended extensively on her own acute hearing during childhood, MacGregor expresses particular understanding about this transition.

She identifies consistent practice as the most crucial element in musical development. How can children be motivated to repeat passages, let alone practice them extensively? MacGregor admits she didn't adopt rigorous practice habits until attending the Royal Academy of Music, where building a contemporary repertoire necessitated disciplined work. She now considers her daily eight hours of practice the foundation of her musical life, more essential than public performances.

""I have tremendous empathy for those who struggle with practice. This challenge receives insufficient discussion."" She suggests that whether practicing twenty minutes or five hours, the key lies in predetermined objectives. Additional strategies include rewarding oneself by playing complete pieces regardless of errors, and balancing difficult passages with easier material.",
317,"Heritage

The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously, we feel connected to our personal heritage usually, we know who and what our grandparents were, and we will have heard stories about how they lived. But, beyond that, there is a wider basic need to learn about our past, in order to help us understand and interpret our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a fundamental desire for continuity - assurance about the past goes a long way to assuring our future. It is through this continuity that we achieve our own place in history, our own immortality.
In the same way that you inherit your genes, you also inherit a culture which has been passed down through many generations. There are aspects of your national heritage that you may not like or condone, but it is yours, and it is reassuring to feel a part of something.
Heritage has a phenomenal amount to teach us and, I would say, is imperative for our well-being. It affects everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link with the past was through the stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But, because Western industrial society broke up communities and families, much of that oral tradition has already been lost. Instead, places and architectural 'memories' give us clues to our past. It is vitally important to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

The Fens

Some while ago I began a novel, Waterland, in which, though I did not know it then, the landscape of that part of England known as the Pens was to play a major part. Since the novel was published I have often been asked why, as an ignorant and perhaps presumptuous Londoner, I chose to write about a part of the country with which I have no personal connection. The short answer is that I chose the Fens because of their apparent unobtrusiveness -- a flat and empty stage on which to set the drama of my book. This, as I learnt, was merely theory. The Fens, once one's imagination has got to grips with them, are neither flat nor empty. What I discovered was that the Fens, while as richly English as any other part of England, are also compellingly and hauntingly strange. It is remarkable that there should still exist in the middle of England a region which most English people find peculiarly foreign, especially when so many other distinctive (and remoter) areas of Britain have been ingested into the nations cultural and literary heritage. The Fens are both empty and brimming, both cultivated and tenaciously wild, apparently 'open' and 'obvious' yet profoundly mysterious.
My own physical researches while writing my novel were in fact not so extensive. I have never been, yet, to Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a writer of fiction I am interested in imagined worlds, and I would much rather hazard an inspired guess at some point of authenticity than go for documentary proof. Yet this very attempt to 'imagine' the Fens has its special logic, for, as the pages of Edward Storey's scholarly book abundantly show, the Fens are, peculiarly, not just a landscape but a state of mind.

Museums

Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this simply meant packing them into display cases, often with wordy labels that made little concession to the lay person. Nowadays, accessibility should demand more than this. Displays can be lively and interesting, making the best use of theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors' attention and perhaps stimulate emotional response. But museums should be about more than their displays. They should make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. The provision of loan boxes of objects for class teachers is one known example of this and, recently, this principle has been extended by some museums so that similar material is made available for use in treating elderly people who are losing their memory.
Museums concern themselves with 'artefacts and specimens' - not replicas. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed - were used - had meaning - at some historical time. This is their great strength, and is what distinguishes them from heritage centres and theme parks, books and CD-ROMs. Museums which rise to the challenge which this distinction implies and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.

Architecture and Environment

The desire to preserve things is not new, but now change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. It turns some people into rabid preservationists and it encourages others to think more closely about the nature of towns as we know them today and their future.
It may be quite reasonably argued that the generations who have lived through events such as world wars and the like are more inclined to preservation than their predecessors - anything which expresses stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it.
Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it. Physical change, in other words, change in the environment provided by our towns, reflects social change - change in our numbers, in our welfare and in our demands.",C2,,"**Heritage**

Heritage helps people feel connected to the past. We often feel connected to our own family history. We know about our grandparents and their lives. But we also need to learn about our country's past. This helps us understand our future. Heritage makes us feel that life goes on. Knowing the past makes us feel safe about the future. This helps us find our place in the world.

Like you get your looks from your family, you also get their culture. This culture comes from many family members before you. There may be parts of your country's history you do not like, but it is still yours. It feels good to be part of something big.

Heritage teaches us many things and is very important for us. It affects our traditions and the things we own. Long ago, people learned about the past from stories told by older people. But when people moved to new places, many stories were lost. Now, old buildings and places help us learn about the past. It is very important to look after these places. They help us remember the people who lived before us.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a book called *Waterland*. In this book, a place in England called the Fens became very important. People often ask me why I, a person from London, wrote about a place I do not know. The simple answer is that the Fens look very flat and empty. I thought they would be a good place for my story. But I learned this was not true. When you think about the Fens, you see they are not flat or empty. I found that the Fens are very English, but they are also very strange. It is interesting that a place in England feels different to many English people. The Fens are empty and also full. They are used for farming but also have wild places. They look open and simple, but they are also very hard to understand.

I did not travel much to the Fens for my book. I have never been to some towns there. As a story writer, I like to imagine places. I would rather imagine what a place is like than check all the facts. But imagining the Fens is a good idea. As one writer shows, the Fens are not just a place you see. They are also a feeling in your head.

**Museums**

Museums must let people see their things. In the past, this meant putting objects in glass boxes with long signs. Today, museums need to do more. Shows can be fun and interesting. They can use ideas from plays to get people's attention and make them feel something. But museums are more than their shows. They should let all people see their things. For example, some museums give boxes of objects to schools for teachers to use. Recently, some museums also give similar things to help old people who cannot remember well.

Museums have real things from the past, not copies. They let you see things that are real. They show items that people used and that were important in history. This is what makes museums special and different from fun parks or books. Museums that make fun shows and programs will find that other ways to learn about history are good for them. They make people want to see the real things that museums have.

**Architecture and Environment**

People have always wanted to keep old things. But now, our towns change very fast. This change affects most of us. It makes some people want to save every old building. It makes other people think more about what our towns are like now and what they will be like later.

It is true that people who lived through big events like world wars often want to save things more. Anything that shows a safe life becomes important to them. If people need to save things in their minds, town planners must think about this.

Change is not bad if we know how to live with it. When the buildings and places in our towns change, it shows that people are changing too. It shows changes in how many people there are, how they live, and what they want.","**Heritage**

Heritage can teach us a lot and is very important for our happiness. It affects things like our traditions and the objects we use. In the past, people learned about the past through stories from older family members. But in modern society, many families moved apart and a lot of these stories were lost. Now, old buildings and places give us information about the past. It is very important to protect these things to remember who our ancestors were.

The Fens are not flat or empty when you really think about them. I found that the Fens are very English, but they are also strangely different. It is interesting that there is still a place in the middle of England that feels foreign to many English people. This is special because many other different areas of Britain are now a normal part of the country's culture and stories. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and they seem simple but are actually very mysterious.

I did not travel a lot to do research for my book. I have never been to some of the towns there. As a writer, I am interested in imagined places.

Displays can be fun and exciting. They can use ideas from theatre or building design to get people's attention and make them feel something. But museums should be about more than just displays. They should let everyone in the community use their collections. For example, some museums lend boxes of objects to schools for teachers to use. Recently, some museums have also started using similar objects to help elderly people who are losing their memory.

Museums are about 'real things' – not copies. Their job is to let people see real things from the past. They show items that were actually used and had meaning in history. This is their great strength. This is what makes them different from heritage centres, theme parks, books, and computer programs. Museums that understand this and create exciting displays and programmes will find that their competitors in 'virtual history' are actually their friends. They make people want to see the 'real thing', and only museums can give people that.

I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working. I squinted info the morning sun looking out at the Arizona mountains and I had to admit, I was not at home on the range,
Flying in from Denver just after dawn, I had the feeling that I just might pass far an ol' cowhand coming in from the sky. The feeling didn't last past the first real cowboy in the luggage hall of Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweat-stained I-shirt, needed a shave, and was hoisting a dirty canvas bag off the conveyer belt when he caught sight of my brand new cowboy boots. He slowly raised one eyebrow and moved off out of the door without looking back.
There ought to be, somewhere, hanging in a closet, a suit of clothes an ex-racing driver can put on without feeling like he is from another planet. Something he could wear so that wherever he goes he doesn't get the feeling that everybody is talking another language and doing whatever they do at half speed. I liked, no, not liked... I flatout loved being a racing driver, driving racing cars. I am addicted to it and it is all I know how to do. But I don't do it any more. I couldn't if I wanted to. Question is, I thought, looking into the mean, rust-coloured rock of the mountains in the distance, what do I do now?
A racing driver should have one or two fall-back identities lined up for when he climbs out of his car. I thought I did, but when I reached for them they just disappeared. How about: an ex-racing driver adds colour to the commentary direct from the trackside? 'We got fifteen guys, all of them former Indy and Formula One drivers, fifteen guys in front of you, Forrest, standing in line to be colour commentators. We'll call you.'
Well then, how about: an ex-racing driver coins a partnership to sell classic cars? That lasted nearly all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers und meetings with bankers. But it was the year nobody was buying old Ferraris and Honda was 'reviewing' its dealer list. So in the end I gracefully withdrew before there was nothing to withdraw from. Being an 'ex' anything is depressing work. I mean you tell me, how badly do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. And even if I had been world champion you could probably just about stand to listen to the story for five minutes before your ears turned to cement. Last year's champion was last year.
Not that I want sympathy. Which is just as well, since I don't get any. Well, why should I? I had a good run, made money and hung on to enough. But oh, man, I miss the heat of slipping into that graceful, elegant, shrink-wrapped super-tech machine with seven hundred horsepower behind my neck. Zero to a hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4,9 seconds. And yes, I miss coming within an eyelash of killing myself every race or so. I miss the bright and gorgeous people and the reporters who acted as if what I said mattered. Being famous, even in a minor way, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians bragged to their friends that they knew me. Little boys slid under fences to get my autograph. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Only last week the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and I have time in the afternoon. And let me just check, but I think tomorrow is free, so much empty time.
I looked up into the soft blue morning sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little brown birds in a saguaro cactus just in front of me were giving me advice, something like 'get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out'. It had never occurred to me that the desert had songbirds. It did occur to me that a bogus cowboy in designer boots had a lot to learn.",C2,,,"I am talking about big cowboy boots. Very expensive boots.

I stood in my designer cowboy boots that cost $800 each. I was on some old rocks in the Arizona desert. I had a lot of money. I was wearing a full cowboy outfit. If you wear the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I was not a cowboy. It didn't feel right. I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains. I had to admit, I did not feel at home in this place.

I flew from Denver early in the morning. For a moment, I felt like I could be a real cowboy arriving from the sky. But that feeling ended when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty T-shirt, he needed a shave, and he was lifting a dirty bag from the luggage belt. He saw my new cowboy boots. He raised one eyebrow and walked away without looking back.

There should be some clothes that a former racing driver can wear. Clothes that make him feel normal, not like he is from another world. Clothes he can wear so that he understands people and feels like he belongs. I didn't just like being a racing driver, I loved it. I love driving racing cars. I need it, and it is the only thing I know how to do. But I don't do it anymore. I can't, even if I wanted to. I looked at the red mountains far away and thought, what do I do now?

A racing driver should have another job ready for when he stops driving. I thought I had other jobs, but when I tried them, they disappeared. For example, maybe a former driver can be a commentator for races? But the answer was: ""We have fifteen former drivers who want to be commentators. We will call you.""

Another idea: a former driver could start a business selling old cars. I tried that for almost all winter. I made phone calls, had lunches, and met with lawyers and bankers. But that year, nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealers. So in the end, I stopped before it was too late. Being an ""ex"" anything is sad. For example, do you really want to hear a story about how I almost became the World Champion? Nobody wants a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, you would only listen for five minutes before you got bored. Last year's champion is not important now.

I don't want you to feel sorry for me. And that's good, because nobody does. Why should they? I had a good career, I made money, and I saved enough. But oh, I really miss the feeling of getting into that fast, beautiful car with seven hundred horsepower. Going from zero to one hundred and fifty miles per hour in less than five seconds. And yes, I even miss the danger of almost crashing in every race. I miss the interesting people and the reporters who listened to me. Being famous, even a little bit, is not so bad. Businessmen and politicians told their friends they knew me. Young boys came to me for my signature. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Last week, my phone only rang twice. I have a lot of free time in the morning and the afternoon. And I think tomorrow is also free. I have so much empty time.

I looked up at the soft blue morning sky. I didn't see any buzzards. Maybe Arizona doesn't have them. But two small brown birds in a cactus near me were making noise. It was like they were saying, ""Go away from our nest."" I never knew the desert had songbirds. I did realize that a fake cowboy in expensive boots has a lot to learn.","I was wearing very expensive cowboy boots. They were really high-quality boots. I stood on the ancient rocks in the Arizona desert, wearing my designer boots that cost eight hundred dollars each. Money was not a problem. I was dressed in a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I wasn't one. It just didn't feel right. I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains and had to admit I didn't belong in this place.

I flew in from Denver early in the morning, and for a moment I thought I could be mistaken for a real cowboy arriving from the sky. That feeling disappeared when I saw the first real cowboy in the Phoenix airport. He wore a dirty T-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting an old bag from the luggage belt when he noticed my new boots. He raised an eyebrow and walked away without looking back.

There should be clothes that a former racing driver can wear without feeling completely out of place. Something that lets him fit in wherever he goes, so he doesn't feel like everyone is speaking a different language or moving at a different speed. I didn't just like being a racing driver—I absolutely loved it. Driving fast cars is something I'm addicted to, and it's the only thing I really know how to do. But I don't do it anymore. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't. So, looking at the rough, rusty mountains far away, I asked myself: What do I do now?

A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when he stops driving. I thought I did, but when I tried, those plans just disappeared. For example, maybe an ex-racing driver could become a commentator at the races? But there are many former drivers waiting for that job. They told me they would call me.

Then I thought about starting a business selling classic cars. I spent almost all winter making calls, having meetings with lawyers and bankers. But that year, nobody was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealers. In the end, I decided to stop before it was too late. Being an ""ex"" anything is depressing. Who wants to hear that I was almost the World Champion? Nobody likes a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been champion, people would only listen for a few minutes. Last year's champion is already forgotten.

I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me, and nobody does. Why should they? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I really miss the excitement of getting into that powerful, high-tech car with seven hundred horsepower behind me. Going from zero to one hundred and fifty miles per hour in less than five seconds. Yes, I even miss the danger of almost crashing in every race. I miss the interesting people and the reporters who acted like my words were important. Being famous, even a little, wasn't so bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Young boys asked for my autograph. And now that I don't drive anymore… Last week, my phone only rang twice. I have too much free time—mornings, afternoons, and probably tomorrow too.

I looked up at the soft blue morning sky. No vultures were flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn't have vultures. But two small brown birds in a cactus nearby seemed to be telling me to go away. I never knew the desert had singing birds. I did realize that a fake cowboy in expensive boots still has a lot to learn.",,

When a photographer takes a photograph, he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, together with a set of social and cultural norms. And in the course of this book we shall see how these factors not only affect the style, content and expression of a photograph, but also how those images are perceived and responded to by the viewer. For example, we might consider that the casual reader of a newspaper will have an implicit understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the page. But rather than accepting the photograph at face value, we might question whether it accurately recorded the scene as it would have looked at the time. Or, in contrast, does it communicate the photographer's point of view? Is it the precise instant recorded that is of particular importance, or should the photograph on the page be understood as a symbol to represent a state of affairs in the world?

More than a game

Sport for me has always been more than just a game. The most successful people in sport have total self-belief. You need tunnel vision if you want to succeed in sport. There's only one route to being the best and you have to put everything else to one side. Sport is ruthless and no one else is going to do it for you. It's sink or swim.
Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it can also teach you the benefits of working as one of a team. My sport allows and encourages you to excel individually, yet it is a team game and you have to balance these two aspects. It's very much like life - you can succeed as an individual, but you must never forget there are others around you.
Sport has given me a great deal - and not just financially. It has opened doors for me and opened my eyes, and I've seen things around the world that others will never see. But you also have to give up a lot for those perks.

Tuning in

Some experiences etch themselves so sharply on our memory that they form islands of clarity in our recollection. For me, such a momentous occasion took place one night in California many years ago, when I lay awake listening to the rapturous strains of a mockingbird singing from an invisible location in one of the tall trees that were dotted around the suburban neighbourhood. I don't suffer from insomnia - it was the exquisite artistry of the singer that kept me awake. As I followed his intricately woven melodies, I found myself drawn into an unexpected aesthetic environment. In order to follow the patterns that issued from the bird, I had to call on my experience of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird had me convinced that I was being treated to an ad lib performance of the most breathtaking improvisational acrobatics. I groaned and I cheered as one improbable musical variation followed another through the open window where I lay listening, until finally I fell asleep.",C2,,"**Photography**

When someone takes a photo, they choose what to show. They choose because of their skills, what they like, their ideas, and what their society thinks is normal. In this book, we will see how these things change the photo. They change how the photo looks and how people see it. For example, a person looks at a photo in a newspaper. But a photo does not always show the truth. We can ask: Does this photo show what really happened? Or does it show what the photographer wants to say? Is the exact time in the photo important? Or does the photo mean something bigger?

**More than a game**

For me, sport is more than a game. The best sports people believe in themselves. To be good at sport, you must think only about sport. There is only one way to be the best. You must not do other things. Sport is very hard, and no one can do it for you. You must try hard, or you will not do well.
Sport taught me to be strong and to not give up. It also taught me how to work with a team. In my sport, you can be good alone, but it is a team game. You must do both. This is like life. You can do well alone, but you must remember other people.
Sport gave me many good things, not just money. It let me do new things and see new places. I saw parts of the world that other people do not see. But to get these good things, you must also stop doing other things.

**Listening to a bird**

Some memories are very clear. One clear memory for me is from a night in California long ago. I was in bed but awake. A bird was singing very beautifully in a tall tree. I could not see the bird. I usually sleep well, but the bird's song was too good. I listened to the song and felt happy. To understand the song, I thought about jazz and Indian music I know. The bird seemed to be making a new song just for me. I lay by the window and listened. The song changed many times and was wonderful. In the end, I fell asleep.","**Photography**

When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, their personal views, and their experience. It is also influenced by the society and culture they live in. In this book, we will see how these things affect the photo's style and meaning. We will also see how people look at and understand the photo. For example, a person reading a newspaper sees the photos on the page and thinks they understand them. But we should not always believe a photo shows the exact truth. We can ask: Did the camera really record the scene exactly as it was? Or does the photo show the photographer's own opinion? Is the important thing the exact moment the photo was taken? Or should we see the photo as a symbol for a bigger idea in the world?

**More than a game**

For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The best sportspeople believe in themselves completely. To succeed in sport, you need to focus only on your goal. There is only one way to be the best, and you must forget about everything else. Sport is very competitive, and no one else can do the work for you. You either succeed or you fail.
Sport has taught me self-control and how to keep trying. It can also teach you how to work well in a team. My sport lets you be a great individual player, but it is also a team game. You have to find a balance between these two things. It is a lot like life - you can be successful on your own, but you must always remember the people around you.
Sport has given me so much, and not just money. It has given me great opportunities and showed me new things. I have seen parts of the world that most people never see. But to get these good things, you also have to give up a lot.

**Listening carefully**

Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one of these important moments happened one night in California many years ago. I was in bed but I could not sleep. I was listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully. The bird was hidden in one of the tall trees in the neighbourhood. I don't usually have problems sleeping - it was the bird's amazing song that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a special, artistic world. To understand the bird's song, I had to remember my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me believe I was listening to a fantastic, made-up-on-the-spot performance. I was amazed as one surprising musical change followed another. I lay by the open window and listened until I finally fell asleep.","**Photography**

When photographers take pictures, they choose what to include based on their technical and artistic abilities, personal opinions, and life experiences. Social and cultural expectations also influence their choices. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect not only the style and message of a photograph, but also how people understand and react to the image. For instance, a person reading a newspaper may think they understand the photos they see. However, instead of just accepting the image as a simple fact, we can ask questions. Does the photo show the event exactly as it happened? Or does it show the photographer's personal opinion? Is the specific moment that was captured the most important thing, or should we see the photo as a symbol for a larger situation in the world?

**More Than a Game**

For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete confidence in themselves. To succeed, you need to focus completely on your goal. There is only one way to become the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is very competitive, and nobody else can succeed for you. You either manage or you fail.
Sport has taught me self-control and persistence. It can also show you the advantages of being part of a team. In my sport, you are encouraged to perform well as an individual, but it is also a team activity, so you have to manage both roles. It is a lot like life—you can be successful on your own, but you must always remember the people around you.
Sport has given me so much, and not only money. It has created opportunities for me and allowed me to see the world. I have visited places that many people never will. However, you also have to make many sacrifices for these benefits.

**A Special Memory**

Some experiences are so strong that we remember them perfectly. For me, one of these important moments happened one night in California many years ago. I was lying awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird. The bird was hidden in one of the tall trees in the neighbourhood. I don't usually have trouble sleeping—it was the bird's amazing singing that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex song, I felt like I was in a special, artistic world. To understand the patterns in the bird's music, I had to remember what I knew about jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me believe I was listening to a spontaneous performance of incredible, improvised music. I reacted to each new and surprising part of the song until I finally fell asleep.","**Photography**

When photographers take pictures, they choose what to include based on their technical and artistic abilities, personal opinions and background, as well as social and cultural expectations. In this book, we will explore how these factors not only influence a photograph's style, content, and emotional impact, but also how people see and react to the images. For example, a typical newspaper reader may feel they naturally understand the photos printed in the paper. However, instead of taking a photograph at face value, we might ask if it shows the scene exactly as it was, or if it expresses the photographer's personal opinion. Is the key point the exact moment that was captured, or should the image be seen as representing a wider situation?

**More Than a Game**

For me, sport has always been much more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete confidence in themselves. To succeed in sport, you need extreme focus. There is only one way to become the best, and you have to ignore everything else. Sport is highly competitive, and no one else can achieve your goals for you—you either succeed or you fail.
Sport has taught me self-discipline and persistence, but it has also shown me the value of teamwork. My sport lets you stand out as an individual, but it is also a team activity, so you have to manage both roles. It is very similar to life: you can do well on your own, but you should always remember the people around you.
Sport has given me a lot, and not just in terms of money. It has created opportunities for me and allowed me to see the world in ways that most people cannot. However, you also have to make many sacrifices for these advantages.

**Tuning In**

Some experiences are so clearly fixed in our memory that we remember them with perfect detail. One such important moment happened to me one night in California many years ago. I was lying awake, listening to the beautiful and complex song of a mockingbird coming from somewhere high in the trees of the suburban area. I was not kept awake by sleeplessness, but by the bird's incredible musical skill. As I listened to its complicated melodies, I felt drawn into a surprising artistic experience. To understand the patterns in the bird's song, I had to use my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird's performance seemed so spontaneous and full of impressive improvisation that I felt I was hearing a unique, live show. Lying by the open window, I expressed amazement at each new musical variation until I finally fell asleep.",

Summer promises us two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match. What was shy and confused within us is unapologetically and cogently phrased in them, a congruence all the more striking if the work was written by someone in a far-flung place or in another age. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. 

Author's Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then 'ecotourism' would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets. Then the thought that these pages were not a guidebook persuaded me that it didn't matter very much, so I let the story tell itself free of debilitating caveats.",C2,,"Holiday Reading

Summer gives us two happy things: going away from home and reading books. These two things are connected. Books can help us feel good in the world. We see our own lives in old books or books from other countries. This is because all people are similar. In books, we find our own feelings and stories. Writers can talk about a problem we thought only we had. They can say what we feel, but in a better way. They write clearly about things that make us feel shy or unsure. This is special when the writer lived long ago or far away. We feel happy that these writers help us know ourselves.

Reading and travel help us see new things. We look more carefully when we are in a new place. Great books also help us see new things. They show us interesting parts of life we did not see before. Our mind starts to notice more. We see the sky's colors, how a person's face changes, or when a friend is not true. We may feel a little sad about something and not know why.

Author's Note

I wrote these travel stories for a newspaper over seven years. I put back a few words that were cut. I did not add much. I fixed some small mistakes. I could have changed more, but then I would never stop. For example, in one story about China, I wrote that the Hong Kong dollar was strong. One year later, it was weak. If I changed the story now, it would not be true to what I knew then. When I traveled, I did not know what would happen next. I was just trying to understand what I saw. Many people travel the world today. They are not experts, but they can still see things. Even a short postcard can have meaning.

Ecotourism

If there was a prize for the most used and changed travel word, 'ecotourism' would win. The word first came in the 1980s. People started to care more about nature. Travel companies saw that tourists did not want to hurt the places they visited. Soon, 'ecotourism' became a popular word to sell holidays.

Now, people use the word ecotourism for many trips. It can be living with a faraway tribe for two weeks. It can be a short boat ride in Australia. Any trip with nature, animals, different cultures, or a little fun can be called ecotourism. At first, the idea was good. It helped people who cared to choose good trips. But there are no clear rules for what ecotourism is. This makes it hard for travelers to know what is true.

Transylvanian Journey

I lost my notebook from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I was lucky to find it again a few years ago. It helped me remember my trip and write about it. But it did not help me as much as I wanted. In Transylvania, I had a very easy time. I stayed in many kind people's homes, often for many weeks. When I stopped moving, I stopped writing. I thought I had nothing to write about if I was not traveling. When I started to travel again, I was slow to write. Sometimes I wrote only small notes, not full stories.

When I wrote this book, I thought maybe I got the order of events wrong. I wrote many careful notes in the text. Then I thought: this book is not a guide, so the order is not so important. So I took out most of the careful notes and just told the story.","Holiday reading

Summer brings two great pleasures: going away from home and reading books. These two things are connected. Books help us feel more comfortable in the world. We can see our own lives in stories written long ago or in other countries. This is because people everywhere share similar feelings. In books, we find our own thoughts and experiences. Writers can describe situations we thought only we had. They can say what we feel, but more clearly. We are thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves.

Reading and travel help us break our daily routines. When we are in a new place, we notice everything. The same happens when we read a great book. It makes us pay attention to things we usually ignore. We start to notice the color of the sky, changes in a person's face, or feelings we didn't know we had.

Author's Note

These travel stories were first articles in a newspaper. I have made only small changes. Sometimes I fixed small mistakes, but I did not rewrite everything. For example, in one article about China, I wrote that the Hong Kong dollar was strong. A year later, it became weak. If I changed my article now, it would not be what I really thought at that time. When I traveled, I did not know what would happen next. I was just trying to understand what I saw. Many people now travel the world. They are not experts, but they can still see and learn things. Even a simple postcard can share something meaningful.

Ecotourism

If there was a prize for the most misused tourism word, 'ecotourism' would win. The word first appeared in the 1980s. People were becoming more interested in the environment. Travel companies saw that many tourists did not want to harm the places they visited. Soon, 'ecotourism' became a popular word to sell holidays.

Today, the word is used for many kinds of trips. It can mean living with a tribe for two weeks or a short boat ride in Australia. Any trip that includes nature, animals, or local culture may be called ecotourism. The first idea behind ecotourism was good. It tried to help tourists make better choices. But because there are no clear rules, many travelers are confused about what ecotourism really means.

Transylvanian Journey

My notebook from my trip to Transylvania was lost for 50 years. I was very lucky to find it again a few years ago. It helped me remember that time and write about it. But it was not a perfect help. In Transylvania, I had a very easy and pleasant trip. I stayed in many friendly homes, sometimes for weeks. When I wasn't traveling, I stopped writing. I thought that because I wasn't moving, I had nothing to write about. Sometimes when I started traveling again, I only wrote short notes, not full stories.

When I wrote my book, I was worried that some events were not in the right order. I added many explanations. Then I realized my book is not a guidebook, so the exact order is not so important. I decided to tell the story simply, without all those extra warnings.","Holiday Reading

Summer provides two of life's greatest pleasures: leaving home and reading books. These experiences are deeply connected. Books help us feel more comfortable in the wider world. We can relate our lives to stories written long ago or in distant countries because human experiences are often similar. In the writing of others, we frequently recognize our own thoughts, difficulties, and personal stories. Authors can describe situations we believed were unique to us, or they can express our own thoughts with greater clarity and insight than we could manage ourselves. What we felt uncertain about within ourselves appears clearly and confidently in their writing. This connection feels particularly significant when the author lived far away or in another historical period. We feel grateful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves better.

Through reading and travel, we escape the dulling effect of routine. We are most observant during our first days in a new location. Similarly, reading an important book makes us notice aspects of life we had previously ignored. Our minds become more alert, like radar detecting new signals. We begin to notice the changing colors of the sky, the shifting expressions on faces, or emotions we hadn't realized we possessed.

Author's Note

These travel observations were originally published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. I have made only minor changes, primarily restoring some passages that were cut to fit the newspaper's format. I corrected a few obvious errors, but only when I had made factual mistakes. I could have continued improving these pieces, but that process would have been endless. For instance, in one article about China, I suggested the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable. A year later, its value dropped. If I revised the article now to include this development, it would appear as if I had predicted it, which wouldn't be accurate. At the time, like any visitor, I had no knowledge of future events and was simply trying to understand my immediate experiences. This represents the reality of modern travel: the world has become accessible to people whose only qualification is being able to afford a ticket. Yet I believe most travelers aren't completely unaware of their surroundings. Even a brief postcard can communicate something meaningful.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for the most misused travel term, ""ecotourism"" would certainly win. The expression first emerged in the early 1980s, reflecting growing environmental awareness and travel companies recognizing that many tourists wanted to believe their visits wouldn't cause harm. It quickly became the most desirable label for holiday packages.

Today, the ecotourism classification has expanded to include almost any experience involving cultural exchange, natural environments, wildlife, or mild adventure—from extended stays with isolated communities to brief motorboat tours through Australian canyons. The original intentions behind the movement were respectable: to enable concerned travelers to make educated choices. However, the absence of regulations and a clear industry definition has left many tourists confused about what genuinely constitutes ecotourism.

Transylvanian Journey

My notebook from the Transylvanian portion of my journey was missing for fifty years until a fortunate discovery restored it several years ago. While it helped me reconstruct that period and commit it to writing, it proved less reliable than I had anticipated. In Transylvania, I encountered much more hospitality than expected, frequently staying for weeks at various country houses. During these extended pauses in my travels, I mistakenly stopped writing in my journal, believing that without movement I had nothing to record. Even when I resumed traveling, I was often slow to continue writing, sometimes substituting brief notes for detailed accounts.

When I began writing this book, I worried that some events might not appear in correct sequence. I initially surrounded these sections with numerous qualifications and reservations. Eventually, I realized that since this isn't a guidebook, precise chronology mattered less. I decided to present the narrative directly, without unnecessary cautions.","Summer offers two of life's greatest pleasures: getting away from home and reading books—joys that are, of course, deeply intertwined. Books help us feel more connected to the wider world. We can compare our own experiences with those depicted in great literature, whether written long ago or in far-off places, because human nature remains more consistent than individual lives might suggest. In the works of others, we encounter our own reflections, embarrassments, and personal dramas. Writers find words for situations we believed we were alone in experiencing, or they articulate our own thoughts with a clarity and emotional precision we could not achieve ourselves. Thoughts that were hesitant and unclear within us are expressed confidently and logically in their writing—a resonance that feels especially striking when the author lived in a distant land or a different era. We feel gratitude to these strangers for helping us understand ourselves more fully.

Through reading and travel, we escape the dulling influence of routine. Our senses are rarely more alert than during our first days in a new location—or perhaps when we are immersed in a great book, which directs our attention to details we had previously overlooked. Our minds become like radar, newly calibrated to detect certain thoughts drifting through our awareness. We notice the shifting colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the subtle insincerity of a friend, or a hidden sorrow in a situation we hadn’t realized could affect us so deeply.

Author’s Note

These reflections on travel originally appeared as articles in the Observer newspaper over a span of seven years. In a few places, I have reinstated minor edits made to fit the text into the available space, but otherwise I have made few additions. I have corrected occasional factual errors, but only when they were details I should have verified at the time. Looking back, I could have made further improvements, but that process could have continued endlessly. For instance, in the second article about China, it appeared plausible—both at the time and for a while afterward—that the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable. A year later, it fell. If I were to revise the article to include that outcome, it would seem like a claim of foresight, rather than a report written in that moment. Like any traveler, whether in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there at that time, unaware of what would happen next and fully engaged in trying to understand what had already occurred. This, in essence, has been the reality of mass air travel: the world opening up to people whose only qualification for exploring it is the cost of a ticket. Still, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were entirely unobservant. Even a simple postcard can be written with intention.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism terms that have been appropriated, diluted, and misused, “ecotourism” would undoubtedly win first place. The phrase first emerged in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental consciousness and a recognition by travel companies that many tourists wanted to believe their visits would not harm the places they visited. It quickly became the most desirable label a holiday could have.

Today, the ecotourism category has expanded to include everything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour motorboat ride through an Australian canyon. Essentially, any trip that involves cultural exchange, scenic landscapes, wildlife, or a hint of light adventure is likely to be classified as ecotourism. There is no question that the movement’s original intentions were commendable—aiming to offer conscientious travelers a way to make informed decisions. However, the absence of clear regulations and a universally accepted definition has left many tourists confused in what has become a dense ecotourism wilderness.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook documenting my travels through Transylvania was lost for fifty years and only recovered a few years ago through a fortunate turn of events. It has been invaluable in helping me reconstruct that period and put it into writing, though it was not the reliable support it should have been. In Transylvania, I found myself having a much more comfortable experience than I had anticipated, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks at a time. During those long pauses, my writing also came to a halt; since I was keeping a travel journal, I mistakenly believed there was nothing to record. I was often slow to resume writing when I moved on, and even then, I sometimes relied on brief notes rather than detailed accounts.

Concerned that some details might have fallen out of order when I began writing this book, I initially surrounded those sections with numerous qualifications and reservations. Eventually, I realized that since this is not a guidebook, perfect chronological accuracy was not essential. I decided to let the narrative unfold naturally, without the burden of excessive disclaimers.",

'Look here, it's no good!' said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice in tow, had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, in the course of which I was presented with the Latin prize and the prize for the girl who had done best in her end-of-school exams. He had had a long conversation with my headteacher, and now here we were bound for home and holidays.
'What isn't?' I said, though I had guessed the trend of his thoughts from my father's unusual silence. He was a talkative man as a rule. 'You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,' he said. 'What with all those certificates. I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.'
'So?' I said, brazening it out. 'Mightn't that be useful?'
'I am also given to understand,' he went on, and then I knew the confrontation was coming, 'that you have ambitions to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!' My father knew quite a lot about barristers and the law.
'I just said that,' I said. 'I couldn't think of anything else to say!'
'And apparently,' he went on, 'you have the right sort of personality - you can pick the bones out of a mass of material pretty quickly, you have the gift of the gab and you enjoy performing.'
'I don't know about that,' I said. 'All I know is what I see in television dramas.'
'Be that as it may,' he went on, pulling himself together, 'I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that I can't see you fancying it.'
The trouble was that, like most children of hereditary trades, I did feel confined by the family expectations. I could see there were various professions open to me, and I wanted to explore the possibilities. At the same time, like a coward, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as frightened of him as Maurice was - I was the favourite - but I found him formidable.
'It's too soon to know,' I said feebly.
'I tell you you're not going to want to join us,' said my father, who had an annoying way of usually being right in such prophecies, 'and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.'
'There's still Maurice,' I said, sullen. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business. 'Anyway,' I went on, 'you could always use me as a sort of consultant.'
It was not as if my mother was around to lend a hand - she had died early in my childhood and my father had brought me and Maurice up. Maurice was two years younger than I was, and because he was motherless, early in our lives I got into the habit of taking care of him. It was not a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was so successful we lived in a good deal of luxury - in a big house in London, posh schools for both of us, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house buzzed with good talk and interesting encounters.
'I tell you what,' my father continued our conversation. 'You can go on helping us out in holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us you can. It will give you a bit of pocket money, and be a real help to me.'
'OK,' I said, relieved to be spared immediate choices and decisions, and especially the bout of depression and sulks my father would sink into if I opposed him. This was the way he controlled us. So it happened. In my last term at school, and then on vacations from university, I lent a hand, never more than about twice a year, and always on the safer assignments. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I intended to wear when I took my final exams.
It was in my last term that my father came up to see me and drove me out to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks to go. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I kept my head and spent these last precious days carefully arranging information in my mind, he might well be right. I felt poised, confident, concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me to do one last assignment for him, that it was the most important piece of business the family firm had ever attempted, and that he would see that it was more than worth my while. 
'But Dad,' I protested, 'I've got my final exams coming up, and I just need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well and I don't want to have to think about anything else just now.'
I could tell that such pressures were simply beyond my father's imagination (or was it that he was somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would interpret a refusal from me as a heartless betrayal in his hour of need.
That was not all. As he described the procedures I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father -- the clarity and resourcefulness with which he set about his life's work, the dynamic energy, the perfect self-control of the man. In his way he was a sort of genius, and I bowed to that in him. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.
'All right,' I said. 'I'll do it.'",C2,,"Family Business

""Listen, this is not good!"" my dad said. We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice came to get me from my expensive school. He was at Parents' Day. That day, I got two prizes - one for Latin and one for my good exam results. He talked for a long time with my teacher. Now we were going home for the holidays.

""What is not good?"" I asked. I knew what he was thinking because he was quiet. He usually talks a lot. ""You can't trick me. You will do what you want now,"" he said. ""You have all those prizes. I heard you will get money to study at Oxford.""

""So?"" I said, trying to be strong. ""Is that bad?""

""I also know,"" he went on, and I knew we would argue, ""that you want to be a lawyer. A lawyer!"" My father knew much about lawyers.

""I only said that,"" I said. ""I did not know what else to say!""

""And,"" he said, ""people say you are good at this - you learn fast, you talk well, and you like to be in front of people.""

""I don't know,"" I said. ""I only see lawyers on TV.""

""Maybe,"" he said, ""but I think you will not want our family business. You will go to Oxford. After that, I think you will not work with us.""

Like many children in family businesses, I felt stuck. I saw other jobs I could do. I wanted to try different things. But I did not want to make my father sad. I was not as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favourite - but he was still strong.

""It's too early to know,"" I said quietly.

""I tell you, you will not want to work with us,"" said my father. He was often right. ""It's too bad because you have the skills - you are smart and brave.""

""There is still Maurice,"" I said, feeling angry. My father made a loud sound. We both knew Maurice did not like the business. ""Anyway,"" I said, ""you could ask me for help sometimes.""

Our mother was not there - she died when I was young. My father looked after me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me. Because we had no mother, I took care of him. It was not hard. I loved Maurice. Our business did well. We lived in a big London house. We went to good schools. We had nice clothes. We went to parties and shows. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, business people. Our house was always full of good talk and visitors.

""Here is my idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us in the holidays until you finish at Oxford. Then, if you want to leave, you can. It will give you money, and it will help me.""

""OK,"" I said. I was happy I did not have to choose now. I was happy to avoid my father's sad mood when I said no. This was how he controlled us. So that is what happened. In my last school term and during university holidays, I helped a little. I only helped about two times a year. I only did easy jobs. I became a good student. I had my own small house. I had a fast white car. I had expensive clothes. I had a black dress from Paris for my final exams.

In my last term at university, my father came to see me. He drove me to a village to eat and talk. There were only a few weeks left. My teacher thought I would get the top grade in Law. I knew if I studied hard, he could be right. I felt ready and sure of myself.

But that did not happen. My father told me that in one week, he needed me to do one last job for him. He said it was the most important job for our family business. He said he would pay me well.

""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to think only about them. It is very important for me to do well. I don't want to think about anything else now.""

I saw that my father did not understand this worry. Maybe he was a little jealous of my life away from him. I thought he would see my 'no' as me being a bad daughter when he needed help.

There was more. As he told me about the job, I saw how strong my father was. He was very clever in his work. He had lots of energy. He always stayed calm. In his way, he was a special person, and I respected that. It made my own plans feel less important.

""OK,"" I said. ""I will do it.""","Family Business

""Listen, this isn't good!"" my dad said. We were in the car going back to London. My father and my brother Maurice had just picked me up from my expensive girls' school. They had also come for Parents' Day. On that day, I got two prizes - one for Latin and one for doing best in my final exams. My father talked for a long time with my headteacher.

""So?"" I said, trying to sound brave. ""Couldn't that be useful?""

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew we were going to argue, ""that you want to be a lawyer. A lawyer of all jobs!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law.

""I only said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And it seems,"" he went on, ""that you have the right personality - you understand difficult information quickly, you speak well, and you like being in front of people.""

""I'm not sure about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV shows.""

""Maybe,"" he said, becoming more serious, ""but I don't think your heart will be in our family business now. Clearly, you'll go to Oxford, and after that I can't see you wanting to work with us.""

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt limited by what my family expected. I could see many different jobs I could do, and I wanted to try different things. At the same time, I didn't want to make my father sad. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite child - but I still found him quite frightening.

""It's too early to know,"" I said weakly.

""I'm telling you, you won't want to work with us,"" said my father, who was usually right about these things. ""It's a shame because you have the skills - you're smart, brave, and you can see what needs to be done.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said quietly. My father made a noise. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business. ""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always ask me for advice sometimes.""

Our mother wasn't there to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice alone. Maurice was two years younger than me, and because we had no mother, I got used to looking after him. I didn't mind - I loved Maurice. Our business did very well, so we lived in a nice way - in a big London house, expensive schools for both of us, good clothes, parties, and trips to the theater. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, business owners - and our home was always full of good conversations and exciting meetings.

""I'll tell you what,"" my father said, continuing our talk. ""You can help us during your holidays until you finish at Oxford. After that, if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some extra money, and it will really help me.""

""OK,"" I said, happy that I didn't have to make big decisions right away. I was especially happy to avoid my father's bad mood that happened when I said no to him. This was how he controlled us. So that's what happened. In my last school term and during university holidays, I helped in the business - never more than twice a year, and always with the safer jobs. I became a successful student with my own small house, a nice white car, expensive clothes, and a special black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term at university, my father came to visit me. He drove me to a village for dinner and a talk. There were only a few weeks until my exams. My teacher thought I would get the top grade in Law, and I knew that if I stayed calm and used these last days to study well, he might be right. I felt ready, sure of myself, and focused.

But things changed. My father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last job for him. He said it was the most important work our family business had ever tried, and he would make sure I was well paid for it.

""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon, and I really need to focus on them. It's very important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could see that my father didn't understand this pressure (or maybe he was a little jealous of my life away from him?). I knew he would think I was being disloyal if I said no when he needed help.

That wasn't all. As he explained what I needed to do, I saw more clearly than ever how determined my father was - how clearly he thought about his work, how much energy he had, and how well he controlled himself. In his own way, he was a kind of genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans and dreams feel less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it.""","Family Business

'Listen, this isn't good!' my father said. We were in the car driving back to London.

'And apparently,' he went on, 'you have the right personality - you can understand complicated information quickly, you speak well, and you like being in front of people.'

'I'm not sure about that,' I said. 'I only know what I see on television.'

'Maybe,' he continued, becoming more serious, 'but I don't think your heart will ever be in our family business. Clearly, you'll go to Oxford, and after that I can't imagine you will be interested.'

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt limited by what was expected of me. I could see there were other careers available, and I wanted to see what was possible. At the same time, I didn't want to disappoint my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favourite - but I still found him quite intimidating.

'It's too early to know,' I said weakly.

'I'm telling you, you won't want to work with us,' said my father, who was often correct in these situations, 'and it's a shame because you have the skills - the intelligence, the courage, the big ideas.'

'There's still Maurice,' I said, feeling annoyed. My father made a dismissive sound. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 'Anyway,' I continued, 'you could always ask me for advice sometimes.'

Our mother wasn't there to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice alone. Maurice was two years younger than me, and because we lost our mother early, I got used to looking after him. It wasn't difficult. I loved Maurice. Since the business did so well, we lived very comfortably - in a large London house, expensive schools for both of us, nice clothes, parties, and trips to the theatre. My father knew many different people - politicians, actors, business owners - and our home was always full of interesting conversations and visitors.

'I'll tell you what,' my father said, continuing our talk. 'You can keep helping us during your holidays until you finish at Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some extra money, and it will really help me.'

'OK,' I said, feeling relieved that I didn't have to make a final decision right away, and especially that I could avoid my father's bad mood if I disagreed with him. This was how he managed us. So that's what happened. During my last term at school, and then during university breaks, I helped out, never more than about twice a year, and always with the safer jobs. I became one of the more successful students, with my own small house, a fast white car, expensive clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a talk. There were only a few weeks left.

I could see that these kinds of pressures were hard for my father to understand (or was he somehow jealous of my life away from him?), and that he would see a refusal from me as a cruel betrayal when he needed me.

That wasn't all. As he explained what needed to be done, I saw more clearly than ever my father's complete determination - the clear thinking and cleverness he used in his work, his great energy, and his total self-control. In his own way, he was a kind of genius, and I respected that about him. It made my own plans and dreams seem less significant.

'All right,' I said. 'I'll do it.'","Family Business

'Look, this simply isn't going to work,' my father declared. We were driving back to London, having just left the exclusive girls' school I attended. My father, accompanied by my brother Maurice, had collected me along with my trunk after Parents' Day, during which I had been awarded the Latin prize and the prize for the highest academic achievement in the final examinations. He had also had an extended discussion with the headteacher. Now we were heading home for the holidays.

'What isn't?' I asked, though I had already sensed the direction of his thoughts from his unusual silence. He was normally a very talkative man. 'Don't pretend with me. You'll do exactly as you please now,' he continued. 'With all those accolades, I've been informed you're likely to receive a scholarship to Oxford.'

'So?' I replied, attempting to appear confident. 'Couldn't that be advantageous?'

'Furthermore,' he went on, and I realised a confrontation was imminent, 'I understand you have aspirations to become a barrister. A barrister, of all professions!' My father was quite knowledgeable about barristers and the legal system.

'I merely mentioned it,' I said. 'I couldn't think of anything else to say at the time!'

'And apparently,' he continued, 'you possess the appropriate qualities – you can analyse complex information rapidly, you're articulate, and you relish being in the spotlight.'

'I'm not sure about that,' I responded. 'I only know what I've seen in television dramas.'

'Regardless,' he said, composing himself, 'I suspect your heart will no longer be in the family business. Clearly, you'll attend Oxford, and after that I can't imagine you developing any enthusiasm for it.'

The issue was that, like many children born into family enterprises, I did feel restricted by familial expectations. I was aware that numerous professions were available to me, and I wished to investigate these opportunities. Simultaneously, somewhat cowardly, I did not want to disappoint my father. While I was not as intimidated by him as Maurice was – I was the favoured child – I still found him a formidable presence.

'It's too early to say,' I said weakly.

'I assure you, you won't want to join us,' my father insisted, with that irritating tendency of his to be correct in such predictions, 'and it's unfortunate because you have the aptitude – the intellect, the composure, the foresight.'

'There's still Maurice,' I muttered sullenly. My father scoffed. We were both aware that Maurice detested the business. 'In any case,' I added, 'you could always engage me as a consultant.'

It wasn't as though my mother was there to mediate – she had passed away during my early childhood, and my father had raised Maurice and me alone. Maurice was two years my junior, and having lost our mother so young, I had naturally assumed a protective role towards him. It was no burden; I loved him dearly. Thanks to the business's considerable success, we lived in considerable comfort – a large London house, prestigious schools for both of us, fine clothing, parties, theatre, and opera. My father moved in diverse circles, including politicians, actors, and business leaders, and our home was always filled with stimulating conversation and fascinating encounters.

'I'll tell you what,' my father resumed. 'You can continue to assist us during holidays until you graduate from Oxford, and then, if you choose to leave, you may. It will provide you with some extra money and be genuinely helpful to me.'

'Alright,' I agreed, relieved to postpone any definitive decisions and, more importantly, to avoid the despondency and sulking that would inevitably follow if I opposed him. This was his method of maintaining control. And so it was settled. During my final school term and subsequent university vacations, I assisted occasionally, never more than twice a year, and only with the less risky assignments. I became one of the more affluent undergraduates, with my own small house, a compact but powerful white car, designer attire, and a black dress from a Parisian fashion house that I planned to wear for my final examinations.

It was during my last term that my father visited and took me to a village restaurant for a meal and a conversation. With only a few weeks remaining, my tutor anticipated I would achieve a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I remained focused and used those final crucial days to systematically organise the material in my mind, he was probably correct. I felt balanced, self-assured, and entirely concentrated.

It was not to be. My father informed me that in about a week he required me to undertake one final assignment for him – the most significant undertaking the family firm had ever attempted – and assured me that the compensation would be exceptionally generous.

'But Dad,' I objected, 'my final exams are imminent, and I really need to focus entirely on them. Performing well is crucial, and I can't afford any distractions at this point.'

I could perceive that such pressures were beyond my father's comprehension – or perhaps he was somehow envious of my life away from him – and that he would interpret a refusal as a callous betrayal in his time of need.

That was not all. As he outlined the procedures, I recognised more clearly than ever my father's single-minded determination – the lucidity and ingenuity with which he approached his life's work, his dynamic energy, his impeccable self-discipline. In his own way, he was a kind of genius, and I respected that quality in him. It made my own ambitions and aspirations seem somewhat less significant.

'Very well,' I said. 'I'll do it.'",
322,"There are some activities that just will not be rushed. They take the time they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter.
The mind, too, works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can he speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot he rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line. 'Think fast; we need the results' may sometimes be as absurd a notion, or at least as counterproductive, as the attempt to cram a night's rest into half the time. We learn, think and know in a variety of ways, and these modes of the mind operate at different speeds, and are good for different mental jobs. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. And both are true.
Roughly speaking, the mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations demand an unselfconscious, instantaneous reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London some years ago, my brain and my body immediately choreographed for me an intricate and effective set of movements that enabled me to keep my seat - and it was only after the action was all over that my conscious mind and my emotions started to catch up. Neither a concert pianist nor an Olympic fencer has time to figure out what to do next. There is a kind of 'intelligence' that works more rapidly than thinking. This mode of fast physical intelligence could be called our 'wits'. (The five senses were originally known as 'the five wits'.)
Then there is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. A mechanic working out why an engine will not fire, a scientist trying to interpret an intriguing experimental result, a student wrestling with an assignment: all are employing a way of knowing that relies on reason and logic, on deliberate conscious thinking. We often call this kind of intelligence 'intellect'. Someone who is good at solving these sorts of problems we call 'bright' or 'clever'. But below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative. Perched on a seaside rock, lost in the sound and the motion of the surf, or hovering just on the brink of sleep or waking, we are in a different mental mode from the one we find ourselves in as we plan a meal or dictate a letter. This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury. We need the tortoise mind just as much as we need the hare brain.
Some kinds of everyday predicament are better, more effectively approached with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be penetrated with a relaxed, unquesting mental attitude. Recent scientific study shows convincingly that the more patient, less deliberate modes of mind are particularly suited to making sense of situations that are intricate, shadowy or ill defined. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is easily conceptualised. When we are trying to decide where to spend our holidays, it may well be perfectly obvious what the parameters are. But when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose - or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought - we need recourse to the tortoise mind. If the problem is how best to manage a difficult group of people at work, or whether to give up being a manager completely and retrain as a teacher, we may be better advised to sit and ponder than to search frantically for explanations and solutions. This type of intelligence is associated with what we call creativity, or even 'wisdom'.
Poets have always known the limitations of conscious, deliberate thinking, and have sought to cultivate these slower, mistier ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the realms of the mind that lie beyond and beneath the conscious intellect. It is only recently, however, that scientists have started to explore directly the slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The hybrid discipline of 'cognitive science' is revealing that the unconscious realms of the human mind will successfully accomplish a number of unusual, interesting and important tasks if they are given the time. They will learn patterns of a degree of subtlety which normal consciousness cannot even see, make sense out of situations that are too complex to analyse, and get to the bottom of certain difficult issues much more successfully than the questing intellect.

",C2,,,"Some things cannot be done quickly. They need their own time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient when making mayonnaise and add the oil too fast, it will not become smooth. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get worse.

Our minds also work at different speeds. Some thoughts are very fast. Others take seconds, minutes, hours, or even years. We can learn to do some things faster, like solving puzzles. But other things cannot be rushed. If we try, they go wrong, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line. Telling someone to ""think fast"" can be as silly as trying to sleep for only two hours. We learn and think in different ways, and each way has its own speed. One saying is, ""He who hesitates is lost."" Another is, ""Look before you leap."" Both are true.

We can think in three main ways. The first is faster than thinking. Sometimes we need to act at once. For example, when my motorbike slid on a wet road, my body knew how to keep me from falling. I only understood what happened after. A pianist or a sports fighter also acts without thinking. This is like using our ""wits.""

The second way is normal thinking. This is when we solve problems or make decisions. A mechanic finding why a car won't start, a student doing homework, or a scientist with an experiment all use this thinking. We call this ""intellect."" People good at this are called ""clever.""

The third way is slow thinking. It is less direct and more dreamy. We think about things without hurry. Sitting by the sea, listening to the waves, or lying in bed half-awake are times for this thinking. This slow way is just as smart as the fast ways. Letting your mind wander is important. We need the ""tortoise mind"" as much as the ""hare brain.""

Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some questions can only be answered when we are calm. Science shows that a patient mind is good for understanding difficult situations. Active thinking works when a problem is simple, like choosing a holiday. But when a problem is hard, like dealing with difficult people at work or changing your job, it is better to think slowly. This kind of thinking helps with new ideas and wise choices.

Writers and poets have always known that slow thinking is useful. Philosophers have written about the deep parts of our mind. Now scientists are studying slow thinking too. They find that our unconscious mind can do many useful things if we give it time. It can notice small details, understand very complex things, and solve hard problems better than fast thinking.","Some activities simply cannot be rushed. They take as long as they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient when making mayonnaise and add the oil too fast, it will separate. If you pull angrily on a tangled fishing line, the knot will only get worse.

The mind also works at different speeds. Some mental tasks happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some can be sped up—for example, we can get faster at solving puzzles or doing maths in our head. But others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they fail, like the mayonnaise, or become more confused, like the fishing line. Telling someone ""Think fast—we need an answer"" can sometimes be as unreasonable as trying to get a full night's sleep in half the time. We learn, think, and understand in many ways, and each way works at its own speed and is useful for different kinds of thinking.

One saying tells us, ""He who hesitates is lost."" Another says, ""Look before you leap."" Both are correct.

In general, the mind works at three main speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike slid on a wet road years ago, my body instantly made the right movements to keep me from falling—I only realised what had happened afterwards. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer doesn't have time to decide what to do next. There is a kind of intelligence that works faster than thinking. This quick, physical intelligence is sometimes called our ""wits.""

Then there is thinking itself: the kind of intelligence we use to solve problems, consider options, build arguments, and make decisions. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won't start, a scientist studying an interesting result, or a student working on homework—all are using logic and careful thought. We often call this ""intellect,"" and people who are good at it are described as ""bright"" or ""clever.""

But there is also a slower way of thinking. This is less focused and more relaxed, dreamy, or thoughtful. When we sit by the sea, lost in the sound of the waves, or when we are half asleep, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower, less direct way of thinking is just as valuable as faster kinds. Giving your mind time to wander is not a waste of time, even when life gets busy. In fact, slow thinking is an important ability. We need the thoughtful ""tortoise mind"" just as much as the quick ""hare brain.""

Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Certain mysteries can only be understood when we are calm and not searching too hard for answers. Recent research shows that a patient, less forceful way of thinking is especially good for understanding complicated or unclear situations. Logical thinking works well when a problem is easy to define. For example, when choosing a holiday, the options may be clear. But when we don't know what to consider, or when the problem is too complex for normal thought, we need the ""tortoise mind."" If the question is how to manage a difficult team at work, or whether to change careers and become a teacher, it may be better to think slowly rather than look desperately for quick answers. This kind of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom.

Writers and poets have long understood the limits of careful, logical thinking and have encouraged these slower, less clear ways of understanding. Philosophers have written about parts of the mind that go beyond conscious thought. Only recently have scientists begun to study these slower ways of thinking directly. Research in cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can achieve many unusual and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognise patterns that normal thinking cannot see, understand situations that are too complicated to analyse, and solve certain difficult problems better than the conscious mind can.",,
323,"England's breakfast revolution 

The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. Admittedly, there are scattered references to travellers having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys, and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs or nobles. 
However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast, as individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours. Often this involved starting work extremely early. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone. ",C2,,"The change in England's breakfast

Health experts say a good breakfast is very important. But in the past, most people in England did not eat breakfast. You only read about kings and rich people eating it. Sometimes, sick people or travelers ate a meal early in the morning.

This changed in the 1500s. Breakfast slowly became normal for everyone. One reason is that there was more food. But there was another big reason. More people started to work for a set number of hours. They often had to start work very early. So, they needed to eat first. Breakfast was now a necessity, not just for rich people.","The change in breakfast habits in England

Health experts agree that eating a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is actually quite new in England's history. During medieval times, people almost never wrote about breakfast in books. There are a few mentions of travelers eating at sunrise before difficult journeys, and sick people having breakfast for health reasons. But most ordinary people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

This situation started to change in the sixteenth century. Breakfast gradually became common for many people. Some writers believe this happened because more food was available. But this explanation doesn't consider other important changes in society. For example, work patterns were changing. More people began working fixed hours, and they often started work very early in the morning. Because of this, eating breakfast became necessary for workers, not just a meal for wealthy people.","England's Breakfast Revolution

But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were royalty or nobility.

This situation changed in the sixteenth century, when breakfast gradually became common for everyone. Some writers suggest this was due to greater food availability. However, this explanation often fails to consider other significant social changes. For instance, new working patterns may better explain why breakfast became more important.

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. 
This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel, for fuel efficiency is a priority - the 2018 deadline has been fixed since the next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031. It's a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies. Given that these can be put in place soon enough, the spacecraft might just make it. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to achieve these ambitious goals will not be in vain, as they will lead to valuable advances for future missions.

This profile matches the envisioned first astronauts to Mars, should billionaire Dennis Tito’s proposal to launch a spacecraft on 5 January 2018 come to fruition. The capsule would transport the crew to an altitude of approximately 160 km above the Martian surface. The spacecraft would utilize Mars’s gravitational field to slingshot back toward Earth without expending additional fuel—fuel efficiency being a critical consideration. The 2018 launch date is essential, as the next favorable alignment of Earth and Mars will not occur until 2031.  
While this appears to be a standard undertaking, there is an urgent push to develop systems based on entirely new technologies. Provided these innovations can be implemented in time, the mission may well succeed. Even if the spacecraft never departs from Earth, the pursuit of such ambitious objectives will not be futile, as it will yield significant technological progress for subsequent space missions.",
325,"CRYING 

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance, with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears, at least during childhood, are mainly an expression of helplessness. However, the persistence of crying into adulthood is harder to explain. It seems that the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. 
Tears can undoubtedly have other causes too. We may cry to express sympathy for those suffering terrible injustice. Furthermore, tears can be shed involuntarily, rather to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may cry when watching a sentimental film, but interestingly, this is more likely to occur in company than when we are alone. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues. 

",C2,,,"Crying

Charles Darwin believed that people's need to cry did not have a clear purpose for human development. He was probably wrong. More recent studies show that crying is important for social life. Expert John Bowlby said crying helps create a strong connection between a mother and her child. Many think that tears, especially in children, mostly show that they need help. But it is more difficult to understand why adults continue to cry. It appears that the sound of crying becomes less important than the tears we see. This might have helped early human groups by building trust and bringing people together.

Of course, there are other reasons for tears. We might cry to show we feel sorry for people who experience unfair treatment. Also, tears can come without us wanting them to, which can feel embarrassing, like when we hear beautiful music or emotional speeches. We might cry during a sad film, but it is interesting that this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social purpose of crying seems clear, but scientists are still studying it.","Charles Darwin believed that humans cry for no clear evolutionary reason. He was probably mistaken.

326,"Blogging: Confessing to the world 

Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins - online announcements of your where-abouts. The site's point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, 'Hey, I'm at this place' - but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere - not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous - and we are lost. 
Depressing? Perhaps, but don't give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity's temptations and perils - all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it's worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the 'WWW', as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once. 
Hall's ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall's site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he'd fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He'd published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, 'it makes people not trust me'. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to 'make people want to be with you', you'll be disappointed. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company - including some whom she'd mocked - and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the 'online distribution effect': that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we'd never dream of saying in person. But our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes. 
Armstrong's saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of 'mommy bloggers' and her writing supports her house hold. Once a poster child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesn't mean we should. ",C2,,"Blogging: Telling the world about yourself

Some time ago, a website talked about the problems of telling everyone online where you are. The website said: when you say, ""I am at this place,"" you are also telling many different people that you are not at home. Not all of these people are good people you want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can be a bad idea.

327,"Build it yourself at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop 

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and apart from a mechanic deep in the bowels of a truck, the only sign of life among the small factories on a backstreet is a whine of machinery from an upper window - work has begun at Bamboo Bike Club, Britain's only bamboo bike-building course. I've gone along to watch the action. 
There's a sense of energy and industry. And of fun. Woodwork class was never like this. Bamboo is one of the most interesting trends to emerge in bike construction. Names like Californian manufacturer Calfee Design or Yorkshire's Bamboo Bikes have revived a construction method pioneered as early as 1894. The problem for most cyclists is the price. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies retails for $2,995, or PS1,868. 
It was this, plus the design challenge, that led James and Ian to spend years cooped up in a shed in Brecon, Wales. Their idea was to establish a boutique bamboo bike business with products within reach of the average cyclist. 
Only after they had refined their research into a marketable product - James now tosses out phrases like 'close-noded thick-wall tubes' while talking about bamboo - did they realise they were on the wrong track. 'We realised we didn't want just to sell frames. We wanted to share the joy of making something; the craft of creating something unique and sustainable,' James explains. 
The outcome was something more community than company, and as such, the Bamboo Bike Club is still an occupation sandwiched between full-time jobs - James makes wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they seem to be on the right track, with monthly courses whose competitive price buys you a computer-designed custom bike frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 
The question for me, a king of the botch job - my terrible handiwork failures litter my house - was about quality. On day one, the boys explain how to select bamboo for strength and how to form strong joints before tubes are glued lightly in place in the workshop: first the front triangle composed of 40 mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more fiddly seat and the chain assembly. Alloy tubes are inserted for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts which require the strength and precise engineering impossible in bamboo. 
All this, together with the technical skill involved in using jigs, power tools and design blueprints, is a leap of faith for someone whose idea of DIY is flatpack furniture assembly. Accurate cutting for a clean joint can be tricky, for example. 
James and Ian buzz cheerfully between workbenches, supervising every cut, triple-checking every joint, and will take over if a task seems insurmountable. The self-build is half the attraction for most participants; it may be no coincidence that all those on this course were engineers. For the rest of us, Ian reassures that everyone messes up once or twice. 
No problem - just get another piece and have another go. Such is the benefit of bamboo. Each length has been pre-checked for quality, so you get to indulge in frame aesthetics: plain bamboo, black or mottled. 
Sunday is a more relaxed day, mainly spent building the lugs. Or rather, wraps: hemp bindings wrapped around the joints and dropouts then glued with epoxy resin to form a strong bond that disperses loads evenly throughout the frame. With a final polymer coating for waterproofing, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any other individual touches. And it is a bike built for the long haul, just as strong, the pair claim, as its metal equivalents. 
Ian has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, while James has failed to destroy one bike off-road over three months of testing. 'To be honest, our bikes are over-engineered - we use larger diameter tubes and over-thick bindings - but I prefer it like that,' James says. 
Technical issues aside, how good does a bamboo bike look? Somewhat scruffy alongside professional frames, it turns out - the hemp weave can look a bit like parcel tape, for example. But there's no denying their individuality and that, say James and Ian, is the point. 
Personally though, I believe that any bicycle made from this kind of material should be a relaxed affair, something for cruising sedately around on rather than racing. I therefore plump for a frame that avoids the stiff angularity of my existing metal machine: a 'Classic English' giving a gentle, easy-going ride. 
They also cycle well. I take James's bike for a spin and the ride is light, stiff and smooth thanks to bamboo's ability to dampen vibration. Impressive, considering I target every pothole. 'Some people love the build, but for me these workshops come together when the bike is on the road,' James says. 'They're so light, so effortless to ride. So much fun to ride too - take a Harley-style retro bike, add 10 and you're still not close.' And the price? Less than PS500. ",C2,,"Build your own bike at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop.

At the Bamboo Bike Club, you can join a weekend course. You will build your own bike frame and have fun. The club is run by James Marr and Ian McMillan.

It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build a bamboo bike. I went there to see what happens.

The place feels busy and happy. It is not like a normal woodwork class. Bamboo bikes are a new and interesting idea. Some companies in America and England make them. But these bikes are very expensive. A ready-made bamboo bike frame can cost almost £2,000.

Because of the high price and the interesting design, James and Ian started to make their own bamboo bikes. They worked for years in a small building in Wales. They wanted to make bamboo bikes that normal people could buy.

First, they wanted to sell the frames. But then they understood something else. ""We didn't just want to sell frames,"" James says. ""We wanted to share the fun of making something special and good for the environment.""

So, the Bamboo Bike Club is more like a group of friends than a company. James and Ian have other full-time jobs, but they run these courses every month. For a good price, you get a bike frame made by a computer and a fun weekend building your bike.

I am not good at making things. I was worried about the quality. On the first day, James and Ian showed us how to choose strong bamboo and how to join the pieces. First, you build the main part of the frame with thick bamboo. Then you add the thinner seat and chain parts. For the handlebars and wheels, you use metal tubes because metal is stronger for these parts.

For someone like me, who is not good at DIY, this was a big step. Cutting the bamboo in the right way is not easy.

James and Ian walked around the room and helped everyone. They watched every cut and checked every join. They helped if a job was too difficult. Many people on the course were engineers who enjoy building things. For people like me, Ian said it is normal to make a mistake once or twice.

But that is okay. You can just take a new piece of bamboo and try again. This is a good thing about bamboo. Every piece of bamboo is checked first for quality. You can also choose how your frame looks: natural bamboo, black, or with spots.

Sunday was more relaxed. We mainly worked on the joins. We wrapped special string around the joints and used a strong glue. This makes the frame very strong. Then we added a special cover to keep water out. After that, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and a seat. James and Ian say the bike is as strong as a metal bike.

Ian uses his bamboo bike every day to travel 16 miles to work. James used one for three months on rough ground and it did not break. ""To be honest, our bikes are very strong,"" James says. ""We use big bamboo tubes and thick string. I like it that way.""

But how does a bamboo bike look? Next to professional bike frames, it looks a bit messy. For example, the string can look a bit like tape. But each bike is different, and James and Ian say that is the important thing.

I think a bamboo bike should be for relaxed riding, not for racing. So I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride.

The bikes are also nice to ride. I tried James's bike. It was light, strong, and smooth because bamboo stops a lot of the shaking from the road. This was great, because I rode over many holes in the road.

""Some people love the building,"" James says. ""But for me, the best part is when you ride the bike. They are so light and easy to ride. They are a lot of fun.""

And the price? Less than £500.","Build your own bike at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop.

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, gives you a special bike frame made by a computer and a fun weekend building a bike.

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The area is quiet except for the sound of a machine from an upstairs window. This is the Bamboo Bike Club, Britain's only place where you can learn to build a bike from bamboo. I have come to see what happens.

The place feels busy and full of energy. It is also fun. It is not like a normal woodwork class. Bamboo is a new and interesting material for making bikes. Some companies in California and Yorkshire have started making bikes this way again. This method is very old. The problem for most bike riders is the cost. A finished bamboo bike frame from these companies is very expensive.

Because of the high price and the interesting design, James and Ian spent years working in a small building in Wales. They wanted to create a small business selling bamboo bikes that normal people could afford.

After they improved their design, they realised something. They did not just want to sell bike frames. They wanted to share the happiness of making something special and good for the environment. So, the Bamboo Bike Club became more like a community than a company. It is something they do alongside their main jobs. They run courses every month. For a good price, you get a special computer-made bike frame and a fun weekend building it.

I am not good at making things, so I was worried about the quality. On the first day, they showed us how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. First, you build the main triangle from thick bamboo. Then you add the thinner seat and chain parts. Metal tubes are used for the handlebars and wheel forks because metal is stronger and more exact.

Using special tools and plans was a big step for me. Cutting the bamboo correctly to make a good joint can be difficult. James and Ian moved around the room happily, helping everyone and checking all the work. They help if a job is too hard. Most people on the course were engineers who enjoyed building things themselves. For people like me, Ian said it is normal to make mistakes. If you do, you just get a new piece of bamboo and try again.

One good thing about bamboo is that each piece is already checked for quality. You can also choose how your frame looks: natural bamboo, black, or with a pattern.

Sunday is more relaxed. You mainly work on the joints. You wrap them with hemp string and use a strong glue. This makes a very strong connection. Finally, you add a special coating to protect the bike from water. Then you add the wheels, brakes, gears, and seat. James and Ian say the bike is as strong as a metal one.

Ian has used his bamboo bike for over a year to travel to work. James tried to break one for three months but could not. James says their bikes are actually built to be extra strong.

But how does a bamboo bike look? Next to professional bikes, it can look a bit rough. For example, the hemp string can look a bit like packing tape. But each bike is unique, and James and Ian say that is what matters.

I think a bike made from this material should be for relaxed riding, not for racing. So I chose a 'Classic English' design for a comfortable ride.

They also ride very well. I tried James's bike. The ride was light, firm, and smooth because bamboo absorbs bumps well. This was impressive, especially as I rode over many holes in the road. James says the best moment is when the bike is finished and you can ride it. He says the bikes are light, easy to ride, and very fun. And the price? It is less than £500.","Build your own bike at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, gives you a custom frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend building a bike.

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The area is quiet except for the sound of machinery coming from an upstairs window. This is the Bamboo Bike Club, Britain's only course for building bamboo bikes. I have come to see what happens here.

There is a feeling of energy and hard work. And of fun. Woodwork lessons at school were never like this. Bamboo is one of the most interesting new materials used for building bikes. Companies like Calfee Design in California or Bamboo Bikes in Yorkshire have brought back a building method that was first used as early as 1894. The main problem for most cyclists is the cost. A finished bamboo frame from these companies costs $2,995, or £1,868.

This high price, and the challenge of designing a bike, made James and Ian spend years working in a small shed in Brecon, Wales. Their plan was to start a small bamboo bike business with products that the average cyclist could afford.

Only after they had developed their research into a product they could sell did they understand they were going the wrong way. James now uses technical terms like 'close-noded thick-wall tubes' when he talks about bamboo. 'We realised we didn't just want to sell frames. We wanted to share the happiness of making something; the skill of creating something unique and good for the environment,' James explains.

The result was more like a community than a company. Because of this, the Bamboo Bike Club is still something they do alongside their full-time jobs - James builds wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they seem to be doing well, with monthly courses. For a good price, you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend of bike-building.

My main question, as someone who is very bad at DIY - my house is full of my failed projects - was about quality. On the first day, the instructors explain how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints before the tubes are glued into place. First, you build the front triangle from 40 mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more complicated seat and chain parts. Metal tubes are used for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts that need the strength and exact engineering that bamboo cannot provide.

All of this, including the skill needed to use tools and follow design plans, is a big step for someone whose idea of DIY is putting flatpack furniture together. For example, cutting accurately to make a clean joint can be difficult.

James and Ian move happily between the workbenches, watching every cut, checking every joint carefully, and they will help if a job seems too hard. Building it yourself is a big part of the attraction for most people on the course; it might not be a surprise that everyone there was an engineer. For the rest of us, Ian says it's normal for everyone to make a mistake once or twice.

It's not a problem - you just get another piece of bamboo and try again. This is one of the advantages of bamboo. Each piece has already been checked for quality, so you can also think about how the frame looks: you can choose plain bamboo, black or with a pattern.

Sunday is more relaxed, and is mostly spent building the joints. Or more accurately, the wraps: these are hemp strings that are tied around the joints and then glued with a strong resin. This creates a strong connection that spreads pressure evenly through the frame. After a final polymer coating to make it waterproof, the bike is ready for the wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any other personal details. The pair say it is a bike built to last, just as strong as a metal bike.

Ian has used his for over a year on his 16-mile journey to work, while James could not break one during three months of testing it off-road. 'To be honest, our bikes are built to be extra strong - we use larger diameter tubes and thicker bindings - but I prefer it that way,' James says.

Apart from the technical details, how does a bamboo bike look? Next to professional frames, it looks a bit rough - for example, the hemp weave can look a bit like packaging tape. But you cannot deny that each one is unique, and James and Ian say that is the main idea.

Personally, I think that a bicycle made from this material should be for relaxed riding, for moving around calmly rather than for racing. Because of this, I chose a 'Classic English' frame that gives a soft, comfortable ride, unlike the stiff feel of my current metal bike.

They also ride very well. I take James's bike for a short ride and it feels light, stiff and smooth because bamboo absorbs vibration well. This is impressive, especially as I seem to hit every hole in the road. 'Some people love the building process, but for me the best moment is when the bike is being ridden,' James says. 'They are so light, so easy to ride. And so much fun - imagine a Harley-style retro bike, add 10 more points of fun and you're still not close.' And the price? Less than £500.","Construct your own bicycle at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, founded by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, provides you with a computer-designed custom frame along with an enjoyable weekend of bicycle assembly.

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and apart from a mechanic working inside a truck, the only activity among the small factories on this backstreet comes from the sound of machinery from an upper window – work has started at the Bamboo Bike Club, Britain's only bamboo bicycle building course. I've come to observe the process.
There's a clear sense of energy and productivity. And enjoyment. Woodwork class was never this engaging. Bamboo is one of the most interesting developments in bicycle construction. Companies like California's Calfee Design or Yorkshire's Bamboo Bikes have brought back a building method first used as early as 1894. The main issue for most cyclists is the cost. A finished bamboo frame from these companies sells for $2,995, or about £1,868.
This high price, combined with the design challenge, led James and Ian to spend years working intensively in a shed in Brecon, Wales. Their goal was to create a specialized bamboo bike business with products affordable for ordinary cyclists.
Only after they developed their research into a marketable product – James now casually uses terms like 'close-noded thick-wall tubes' when discussing bamboo – did they realize they were focusing on the wrong approach. 'We understood we didn't just want to sell frames. We wanted to share the pleasure of making something; the skill of creating a unique and sustainable product,' James explains.
The result became more of a community than a company, and because of this, the Bamboo Bike Club remains an activity they do alongside their full-time jobs – James builds wind turbines and Ian works as a civil engineer. But they appear to have found the right direction, with monthly courses that at a competitive price include a computer-designed custom bike frame plus a fun weekend of bicycle building.
For someone like me, who is notoriously bad at practical tasks – my house contains many examples of failed DIY projects – quality was a major concern. On the first day, the instructors explain how to choose bamboo for strength and how to create strong joints before tubes are carefully glued in place: first the front triangle made from 40mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more complicated seat and chain sections. Metal tubes are used for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts that need the strength and precise engineering that bamboo cannot provide.
All of this, together with the technical skill needed to use jigs, power tools and design plans, requires considerable confidence for someone whose DIY experience is limited to flat-pack furniture. For example, cutting accurately to create neat joints can be difficult.
James and Ian move cheerfully between workbenches, supervising every cut, carefully checking every joint, and they will take over if a task seems too challenging. The opportunity to build it yourself is a major attraction for most participants; it might not be a coincidence that everyone on this course was an engineer. For the rest of us, Ian reassures that everyone makes mistakes occasionally.
It's not a problem – just take another piece and try again. This is one advantage of bamboo. Every piece has been checked for quality beforehand, so you can focus on the frame's appearance: natural bamboo, black, or patterned.
Sunday is more relaxed, mainly spent building the connection points. Or more precisely, wraps: hemp cords are wound around the joints and then secured with epoxy resin to create a strong bond that spreads pressure evenly across the frame. After a final polymer coating to make it waterproof, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any personal touches. The resulting bicycle is built to last, with the pair claiming it is just as strong as metal equivalents.
Ian has used his for over a year on a 16-mile daily commute, while James has been unable to break one despite three months of tough off-road testing. 'Honestly, our bikes are over-engineered – we use larger diameter tubes and thicker bindings – but I prefer it that way,' James says.
Apart from technical aspects, how attractive is a bamboo bike? Somewhat rough compared to professional frames, as it happens – the hemp wrapping can look a bit like packaging tape, for instance. But their unique character is undeniable, and that, James and Ian say, is the main point.
Personally, I believe any bicycle made from this material should be for relaxed use, suitable for gentle riding rather than racing. I therefore chose a frame that avoids the stiff, angular feel of my current metal bike: a 'Classic English' model that provides a soft, comfortable ride.
They also perform well on the road. I took James's bike for a short ride and found it light, stiff and smooth because bamboo absorbs vibration well. This is impressive considering I hit every pothole on purpose. 'Some people love the building process, but for me these workshops succeed when the bike is being ridden,' James says. 'They're so light and easy to ride. Very enjoyable too – imagine a Harley-style retro bike, multiply by ten, and you're still not close.' And the price? Under £500.",
328,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement), before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. Chen, however, was actually amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. 'So you can really drive it then, Lily? Well done!'
Men were strange creatures, Mui thought. Brother-in-law should have been upset about this. Yet he was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. This was the slackest day of the week, they decided to leave early in the morning and return by midday. That way they need lose no customers. In the meantime Lily would practise around the allotments.
Resolved to go along with the majority despite her personal misgivings, Mui had been to buy a road-map. She had been able to get a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, though Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of faith in her navigating abilities.
Within an hour of stepping over the newspapers and out of the front door, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, one hand on the cross-braces of Man Kee's rompers as he pressed his nose against the window, had to grant this. On the road Lily had actually overtaken a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve and such timing that Mui had pressed her lips closely together against her own protest. Chen went as far as applauding.
Now, after coming through the gasworks of this seaside town (reassuring, familiar sight), past the lagoon and its miniature motor boats, they were moving smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the sea front which was full of empty bays.
She was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away. Or even being served with a summons. Might this evidence of basic prudence set Mui's mind at rest? On the way down Lily had several times observed her elder sister's taut face in the driving mirror, which she used with great frequency. Perhaps it would be best not to put worries in Mui's mind which would not have occurred to her in the first place. Lily personally locked all the van doors and meticulously tested each in turn.
'Don't worry,' Chen joked. 'No one will want that heap of tin.' The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances.
Taken aback, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the two sisters to look at the grey barbarian sea. He perched Son on the top railing and put his arms around his stomach. Man Kee was a soft, warm, and what was more, these days an increasingly responsive bundle. He reacted by putting his hand, a tiny replica of the shape of Chen's, with its broad palm and stubby fingers, on his father's sleeve.
And it was in that moment that Chen resolved to bring Son up his way. He would have an education in figures (Chen's own weak point) and grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience in all aspects of the trade on the way. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career.
There was a trail of smoke just before the horizon met the sea in a thin line and then, suddenly shimmering in the glitter of the rising morning sun on the metal waves, a hull; and in a small cute of the railings was a grey telescope. The sparkle of the water instantly altered Chen's mood.
He put a coin in the slot and trained the glass on the ship. He was unable to find it at first, although he had aimed off carefully with the gun-sight on top of the barrel. Chen swung the tube in wide circles. There it was! Gone again. Chen swivelled the instrument more carefully. Now he had it in the centre of the circle, surprisingly large, red, and very rusty with a small bow wave: tramp steamer.
Chen lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. 'Do you see the ship, Son?' he asked softly. 'It is a special little ship for people like us, Son. It is very little and very old but that is only what strangers see. We know better, don't we, Son, because it is the ship that will take us all back home when we are finished here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen.'
Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Behind him now were Lily and Mui. Lily put her arm round Husband's shoulders. 'The little old ship,' said Chen. 'Let your mother see, Son.'
Man Kee would not be parted from the telescope and when he had been persuaded to relinquish his grip the whirring inside the mounting had stopped and all Lily could see was a quivering opaque circle of white light with a scratched surface. By the time Chen had found a second coin the ship was over the horizon and Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake.",C2,,"The two sisters did not tell Chen about Lily's driving for some time. Lily drove near the small gardens and the train tracks. She drove fast over a little bridge. The car jumped. Chen was not angry. He was happy. He said, ""So you can drive, Lily? Well done!""

Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been upset. But he was not. Soon, Chen and Lily made plans for a trip. They were both happy about it.

They chose a Monday morning next month. They would come back by lunch. Then they would not lose customers. Lily would practice driving near the gardens until then.

Mui was worried, but she agreed. She bought a map for less money. Chen liked this. But Lily was a little sad that Mui did not trust her driving.

They left home early. In one hour, they saw the sea. Lily drove very well. Mui sat in the back seat. She was ready to help, but she saw Lily was good. Lily passed two slow cars. Chen clapped.

They drove into a town. They passed a small lake with little boats. Then they drove by the sea. Lily parked the car on a small street.

She did not know the road signs. She paid money to park. She did not want the car to be taken away. She wanted Mui to feel better. Lily locked all the car doors.

""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one wants this old car."" The sisters were angry. Lily said Chen was not nice. Mui said he cared too much about looks.

Chen was surprised. He took his son, Man Kee, to see the grey sea. He held his son on the railing. Man Kee was soft and warm. He put his small hand on his father's arm.

Then, Chen decided he would teach his son his way. His son would learn about numbers. One day, his son would have many restaurants. The sea made Chen feel thoughtful.

He saw smoke far away. Then he saw a ship. There was a telescope. Chen put a coin in it. He looked for the ship. At first, he could not see it. Then he saw it. It was a small, old, red ship.

Chen held Man Kee up to look. ""Do you see the ship?"" he asked quietly. ""It is a special ship for us. It is small and old. But it is important. One day, it will take us home. It will take you to your homeland. You have never seen it.""

Chen kissed his son's head. Lily came and put her arm around her husband. ""The little old ship,"" said Chen. ""Let your mother see, Son.""

Man Kee did not want to stop looking. When he moved, the telescope stopped. Lily saw only a white circle. Chen looked for another coin. But the ship was gone. Lily saw only seagulls looking for food on the water.","The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and near the railway and gasworks. Once, she drove over a small bridge so fast that all four wheels left the ground, and they landed with a big bump. This was Lily's only mistake. Chen was not angry when he found out. Instead, he was amused by what his wife had done. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said.

Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been upset, but he wasn't. Soon, he was happily making plans with Lily for a trip. He was clearly happy about her new skill.

They decided to go on a Monday at the start of the next month. This was the quietest day of the week. They planned to leave early in the morning and come back by midday so they wouldn't lose any customers. Until then, Lily would keep practising near the gardens.

Mui had her doubts, but she decided to go along with the plan. She even bought a road map. She got a ten percent discount, which Chen thought was good. Lily, however, felt a little insulted because it seemed Mui didn't trust her to find the way.

Just an hour after they left home, they could see the English Channel. Lily had driven perfectly. Even Mui, who was sitting in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit it. Lily had even passed a few slow cars with such skill that Mui stayed quiet. Chen was so pleased he clapped.

They drove through the gasworks of the seaside town, which looked familiar, past a small lake with little boats, and then along the empty promenade. Lily parked the van on a small street near the sea. There were many empty parking spaces.

She wasn't sure about the road signs, so she decided to pay for parking to avoid getting a fine or having the van taken away. She hoped this careful choice would make Mui feel less worried. During the drive, Lily had often seen her sister's worried face in the mirror. Maybe it was better not to mention things that would make Mui anxious. Lily carefully locked all the van doors and checked each one.

""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one would want to steal that old van."" The sisters were not happy with his joke. Lily said he was ungrateful. Mui told him he cared too much about how things look.

Surprised by their reaction, Chen took his son, Man Kee, and walked ahead of the sisters to look at the grey sea. He lifted Man Kee onto the railing and held him around his middle. Man Kee was a soft, warm boy who was starting to respond more. He put his small hand, which looked just like his father's, on Chen's sleeve.

At that moment, Chen decided he would raise his son his own way. The boy would learn about numbers, which was something Chen was not good at himself. He would grow up to own many restaurants and learn all about the business. Looking at the dark sea made Chen feel a little sad but also pleased as he thought about his son's future.

Then, he saw a line of smoke on the horizon. A ship appeared, shining in the morning sun on the water. Nearby, there was a grey telescope fixed to the railings. The sparkling water changed Chen's mood.

He put a coin in the telescope and tried to look at the ship. At first, he couldn't find it, even though he tried to aim carefully. He moved the telescope around in big circles. There it was! Then it was gone again. Chen moved the telescope more slowly. Finally, he found it. It was a small, old, red, and rusty ship.

Chen lifted Man Kee to look. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked quietly. ""It's a special little ship for people like us. It looks small and old to strangers, but we know better, don't we? It's the ship that will take us all back home one day. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen.""

Chen kissed the top of his son's head. Lily and Mui came and stood behind him. Lily put her arm around her husband's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" said Chen. ""Let your mother see, Son.""

Man Kee did not want to let go of the telescope. When they finally got him to move, the inside of the telescope had stopped working. All Lily could see was a shaky circle of white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone over the horizon. All Lily saw were seagulls looking for food in the water.","For some time, the two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen. She would drive around the local gardens, the railway, and the gasworks. She even drove quickly over a small bridge so that all four wheels left the ground, landing with a loud bump—Lily's only mistake. She finished her drive near the gasworks, which smelled strongly of sulfur. Surprisingly, Chen was amused when he found out what his wife had been doing without his knowledge. ""So you really can drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said.

Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been angry, but instead he quickly started making happy plans with Lily for a trip. He clearly enjoyed her new skill.

They chose a Monday at the start of the next month. It was their quietest day, so they decided to leave early in the morning and come back by lunchtime. That way, they wouldn't lose any customers. Until then, Lily would keep practising near the gardens.

Even though Mui had her doubts, she went along with the plan and bought a road map. She got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, though Lily was a little offended that Mui didn't trust her sense of direction.

Less than an hour after leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily had driven perfectly. Even Mui, who sat in the back ready to give directions with one hand on her son Man Kee's clothes as he looked out the window, had to admit it. On the road, Lily had confidently passed a few slow cars with such good timing that Mui stayed silent instead of complaining. Chen even clapped.

Now, after passing the familiar gasworks of the seaside town and the lagoon with its small motor boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street near the sea that had many empty parking spaces.

She wasn't sure what all the road markings meant, so she decided to pay for parking to avoid having the car towed or getting a fine. She hoped this sensible choice would make Mui feel less worried. During the drive, Lily had often seen her older sister's tense face in the rearview mirror. Maybe it was better not to mention problems Mui hadn't even thought of. Lily carefully locked all the van doors and checked each one.

""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one would want to steal that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily said her husband was ungrateful, and Mui told him he cared too much about looks.

Surprised by their reaction, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the sisters to look at the grey sea. He lifted his son onto the railing and held him around his middle. Man Kee was a soft, warm child who was becoming more responsive. He put his small hand, which looked just like his father's with its wide palm and short fingers, on Chen's sleeve.

At that moment, Chen decided he would raise his son in his own way. The boy would learn about numbers—Chen's own weak subject—and grow up to own several restaurants, learning every part of the business along the way. The calm sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he imagined Man Kee's future.

Just where the sky met the sea, a line of smoke appeared. Then, shining in the morning sun on the water, a ship's hull came into view. Nearby, set into the railings, was a grey telescope. The sparkling water suddenly lifted Chen's mood.

He put a coin in the telescope and pointed it at the ship. At first, he couldn't find it, even though he aimed carefully using the sight on top. Chen moved the telescope in wide circles. There it was! Then it was gone again. He moved it more carefully and finally found the ship in the centre of the view. It was surprisingly large, red, and very rusty, with a small wave at the front—a working cargo ship.

Chen lifted Man Kee to look. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked quietly. ""It's a special little ship for people like us. It's small and old, but that's only what strangers see. We know better, don't we, Son? Because it's the ship that will take us all back home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you've never seen.""

Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui had joined them. Lily put her arm around her husband's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" said Chen. ""Let your mother see, Son.""

Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope. When he finally did, the mechanism had stopped working, and all Lily could see was a shaky circle of white light with scratches on it. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone over the horizon. All Lily saw were seagulls looking for food in the ship's trail on the water.","For some time, the two sisters concealed from Chen the fact that Lily had been driving. She would practise around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, taking the small hump-backed bridge at such speed that all four wheels left the ground, landing with a jarring impact—Lily’s sole miscalculation—before finishing her circuit near the gasworks amid a smell of sulphur. Far from being angry, however, Chen was amused by his wife’s secret activities. “So you really can drive, Lily? Well done!”  
Men were strange, Mui reflected. Her brother-in-law ought to have been displeased, yet instead he was soon eagerly arranging an outing with Lily, clearly delighted by her new skill.  
They settled on a Monday at the start of the following month. As the quietest day of the week, they planned to set off early and return by midday so as not to lose any business. In the meantime, Lily continued to practise around the allotments.  
Although privately uneasy, Mui acquiesced to the general plan and bought a road map. She managed to get a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, though Lily was slightly offended by what she saw as a lack of faith in her navigation.  
Within an hour of leaving the house, they were looking out at the English Channel. Lily had driven flawlessly. Even Mui, seated in the back with one hand on the straps of Man Kee’s rompers as he pressed his nose to the window, had to concede this. On the road, Lily had overtaken a few slower vehicles with such confidence and precision that Mui bit back her objections. Chen went so far as to applaud.  
Now, having passed through the gasworks of the seaside town—a familiar, reassuring sight—and driven by the lagoon with its miniature motor boats, they were cruising smoothly along the deserted promenade. Lily parked in a small side street near the sea front where there were plenty of empty spaces.  
Uncertain about the parking restrictions, she preferred to pay rather than risk having the van towed or receiving a fine. She wondered whether this show of caution might ease Mui’s anxiety. Several times during the journey, Lily had noticed her older sister’s tense expression in the frequently consulted driving mirror. Perhaps it was better not to mention worries Mui might not otherwise have considered. Lily personally locked all the van doors and tested each one carefully.  
“Don’t worry,” Chen joked. “No one would want that heap of scrap metal.” The sisters reacted indignantly. Lily accused him of ingratitude, and Mui reproached him for being arrogant and too easily misled by outward appearances.  
Taken aback, Chen walked ahead with Man Kee to look at the grey, foreign sea. He lifted his son onto the top railing, holding him securely around the waist. Man Kee was a soft, warm, and increasingly responsive little boy. He responded by placing his hand—a small copy of Chen’s, with its broad palm and stubby fingers—on his father’s sleeve.  
It was at that moment that Chen resolved to bring up his son according to his own principles. The boy would receive a thorough education in arithmetic—Chen’s own weak point—and eventually own several restaurants, learning every aspect of the trade along the way. Gazing at the sombre sea, Chen felt a pleasant melancholy as he mapped out Man Kee’s future.  
A trail of smoke appeared just where the horizon met the sea in a fine line, and then, suddenly glinting in the morning sun on the metallic waves, a hull emerged. Set into the railings was a grey telescope. The sparkle on the water immediately lifted Chen’s spirits.  
He inserted a coin and trained the telescope on the ship. At first he couldn’t locate it, despite carefully adjusting the sight on top of the barrel. Swinging the tube in broad arcs, he finally found it—only to lose it again. Moving the instrument more deliberately, he centred it in the viewfinder: surprisingly large, red, and heavily rusted, with a small bow wave—a tramp steamer.  
Lifting Man Kee to the eyepiece, Chen asked softly, “Do you see the ship, son? It’s a special little ship for people like us. It may look small and old to strangers, but we know better, don’t we, son? It’s the ship that will take us all back home when our work here is done. It will take you to the homeland you’ve never seen.”  
Chen kissed the top of Man Kee’s head. Lily and Mui had joined them now, and Lily put her arm around her husband’s shoulders. “The little old ship,” said Chen. “Let your mother see, son.”  
But Man Kee refused to let go of the telescope, and by the time he was persuaded, the mechanism had stopped whirring. All Lily could see was a shimmering, opaque circle of white light with a scratched surface. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had vanished over the horizon, leaving Lily with a view of seagulls scavenging scraps in its wake.",
329,"I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals, and I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I suppose that by the exercise of invention I could fill the gaps plausibly enough and so make my narrative more coherent; but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know.
To save embarrassment to people still living I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving, and I have in other ways taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.
I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I never kept notes of what was said on this or the other occasions, but I have a good memory for what concerns me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words they faithfully represent, I believe, what was said. I remarked a little while back that I have invented nothing but I have taken the liberty that historians have taken to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard. I have done this for the same reasons that the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted. I want to be read and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make my book readable. The intelligent reader will easily see for himself where I have used this artifice, and he is at perfect liberty to reject it.
Another reason that has caused me to embark upon this work with apprehension is that the persons I have chiefly to deal with are of another culture. It is very difficult to know people and I don't think one can ever really know any but one's own countrymen. For men and women are not only themselves; they are also the region in which they were born, the city apartment or the farm in which they learnt to walk, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed and the poets they read. It is all these things that have made them what they are, and these are the things that you cant come to know by hearsay, you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you cannot know persons of a nation foreign to you except from observation, it is difficult to give them credibility in the pages of a book. I have never attempted to deal with any but my own countrymen, and if I have ventured to do otherwise in short stories it is because in them you can treat your characters more summarily. You give the reader broad indications and leave him to fill in the details. In this book, I do not pretend that my characters are as they would see themselves; they are seen, as is my main character, through my own eyes.",C2,,"I am not sure about this book. I call it a story because I don't know a better word. There is not much story to tell. It does not end with a wedding or a death. I just stop, and the reader may feel the story is not finished.

This book is about a man I knew. I did not see him often. I don't know what he did when I was not with him. I could make up things to fill the empty parts, but I do not want to. I will only write what I know.

I have changed the names of people in this story. I do not want anyone to know who they are. The man I write about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. When he dies, people may forget him. Then, people may read my book only if they like the story.

But maybe his way of life and his good character will become important to people. Maybe, long after he dies, people will see he was a special person. Then, everyone will know who I write about. People who want to know about his early life may find my book useful.

I did not write the exact words people said. But I remember things well. I wrote the talks in my own words, but I think they show what was really said. Sometimes I wrote things people might have said, even if I did not hear them. I did this to make the story more interesting. I want people to read my book. A smart reader will see when I have done this.

I was also worried because the people in my book are from a different country. It is hard to know people from other places. A person is not just themselves. They are also the place they come from, their home, the games they played, the food they ate, and the books they read. You cannot know these things just by hearing about them. You have to live them.

Because I cannot know people from other countries well, it is hard to write about them. I usually only write about people from my own country. In short stories, it is easier to write about people from other countries because you don't need to write many details. In this book, I do not say I show the people as they see themselves. I show them as I see them.","I have never started a book with more worry. I call it a novel only because I don't know what else to call it.

This book is about my memories of a man I only met sometimes, and I don't know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up stories to fill the empty parts and make the book flow better, but I don't want to do that. I only want to write what I know.

To protect people who are still alive, I have given new names to everyone in this story. I have tried hard to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. Maybe he never will be. Maybe when he dies, he will leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. Then, if anyone reads my book, they will read it only because they find it interesting. But maybe the way he lived and his good character will become more and more important to other people. Then, long after he dies, people may realize that a very special person lived in our time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and people who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book, even with its limits, will be helpful for people who later write about my friend's life.

I don't say that the conversations I wrote down are exactly what was said. I never wrote notes about what people said, but I remember things well. Even though I have written the conversations in my own words, I believe they show what was really said. I said before that I didn't make anything up, but like historians, I have sometimes written speeches for people that I did not hear. I did this for the same reason historians do: to make the scenes more lively and real. I want people to read my book, and I think it's okay to try to make it interesting to read. Smart readers will see where I have done this and can choose not to believe those parts if they want.

Another reason I feel worried about writing this book is that the people in it are from a different country. It is very hard to know people, and I think you can only really know people from your own country. This is because people are not just themselves; they are also the place where they were born, the home where they learned to walk, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they did, and the poems they read. All these things make them who they are, and you can't learn these things just by hearing about them. You have to live them yourself. You have to be them. Because you can't know people from other countries well—you can only watch them—it is hard to make them seem real in a book. I have only written about people from my own country before. If I have written about people from other countries in short stories, it's because in short stories you can describe characters more simply. You give the reader general ideas and let them imagine the details. In this book, I don't say that my characters are exactly as they see themselves. I show them, especially the main character, as I see them.","I have never started a novel with more hesitation. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have very little story to tell, and I don't end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader without a clear conclusion. This book contains my memories of a man I only met occasionally, and I know very little about what happened to him in the periods between. I suppose I could use my imagination to fill the gaps and make my story more connected, but I have no desire to do that. I only want to record what I actually know.

To avoid causing embarrassment to people who are still alive, I have given made-up names to the individuals in this story, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can identify them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never become famous. It is possible that when his life finally ends, he will leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. If anyone reads my book, they will read it only for whatever interest it might hold. However, it is also possible that the way he chose to live and his unique character, with its strength and kindness, will have an increasing influence on others. Perhaps long after his death, people will realize that a truly remarkable person lived in our time. Then it will become obvious who I am writing about, and those who wish to learn something about his early life may find my book useful. I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a valuable source for anyone who might write his biography in the future.

I do not claim that the conversations I have recorded are exactly what was said. I never took notes of what people said on various occasions, but I have a good memory for things that involve me. Although I have written these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately represent what was discussed. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same freedom as historians do by including speeches for my characters that I did not hear and could not have heard. I did this for the same reason historians do—to make scenes more lively and realistic. If I had simply described them, they would have been less effective. I want people to read my book, and I think it is reasonable to try to make it engaging. An intelligent reader will easily recognize where I have used this technique and is completely free to disregard those parts.

Another reason I began this work with concern is that the main people in it are from a different culture. It is extremely difficult to understand people, and I don't believe you can ever truly know anyone except those from your own country. People are not just individuals; they are also products of the place where they were born, the home where they learned to walk, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they enjoyed, and the poetry they read. All these factors have shaped them, and you cannot learn these things from stories alone—you have to experience them yourself. You can only truly understand if you are them. Since it is impossible to know people from other countries well without direct observation, it is challenging to make them believable in a book. I have only ever written about people from my own country before, and if I have written about others in short stories, it is because in short stories you can describe characters more briefly. You provide the reader with general impressions and allow them to imagine the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters are exactly as they see themselves; they are seen through my own perspective, especially the main character.",,
330,"Othello

The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. Indeed the whole cast is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with the other young officers get dangerously out of hand, and the moment when Iago begins to lose control and has to struggle to get a grip on himself. And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production.

Lake Vostok

In the heart of Antarctica, nothing stirs. On the fringes of the continent there are penguins, seals and birds aplenty. But up on the great white plateau in the interior, life has no foothold. Except, that is, in a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometres of ice, directly below the coldest spot on earth. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists can hardly wait to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within. Geologists and glaciologists are hot on their heels. For two years now, researchers round the world have been plotting ways to uncover the lakes secrets, and, if they get their wish, in the next few years we will witness the decade of Lake Vostok.

Scientists

There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists; the expression 'because it's there' springs to mind. Sure we all know its the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from the atom to the black hole. But what these guys want to know is why we want to know all of this in the first place and why can't science explain why we want to know?
Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than get bogged down in debates over the point of it all. I would have thought that the crucial issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognise that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when and why to use it.",C2,,"**Othello**

A very good show of Shakespeare's play Othello is now in London. I can say sorry for my bad review from last spring. I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello. I also said his acting was bad. I still think it is wrong that Othello and Desdemona are the same age. But I was wrong about the rest. Mr Fearon is a very good actor. All the actors are very good. You will remember the part where Cassio plays with other soldiers and it becomes a fight. You will also remember when Iago cannot control his feelings. And I think everyone will cry when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The show is fast and exciting. You must see it.

**Lake Vostok**

In the middle of Antarctica, nothing lives or moves. At the edge of the land, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But inside, on the big white flat land, there is no life. But there is one special place. A very big, hidden lake is there. It is called Lake Vostok. It is under a lot of ice. It is under the coldest place on Earth. The water has had no air or sun for a very, very long time. Scientists want to look in the deep water. They want to find strange life there. Other scientists want to do this too. For two years, people from many countries have tried to learn the lake's secrets. If they can do it, we will know more about Lake Vostok soon.

**Scientists**

I heard something interesting on the radio last week. Some scientists are talking about a question. The question is: why do people become scientists? We know that scientists want to learn new things. They want to understand the world. But these scientists want to know why we want to know these things. And why can't science answer this question?

I think it is more important to ask if what we scientists do is good. We should not talk too much about why we do it. The important thing is to see that science is a tool. We are the people who must choose how to use this tool. We must choose when and why to use it.","**Othello**

A very good production of Shakespeare's play Othello has moved from Stratford to London. This lets me fix a review I wrote last spring that was not fair. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello, and I was wrong about his acting. I still think it is a problem that Othello and Desdemona are shown as the same age. But I must say that the rest of Mr Fearon's acting is very good. In fact, all the actors are very good. You will remember the scene where Cassio's games with other officers become dangerous. You will also remember when Iago starts to lose control and must calm down. I am sure everyone will feel sad and want to cry when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The play moves at a good speed and is very exciting. You should go and see it.

**Lake Vostok**

In the middle of Antarctica, nothing moves. At the edge of the continent, there are many penguins, seals and birds. But on the big white flat land inside, there is no life. There is one special place, however. A huge hidden lake of fresh water called Lake Vostok is under almost 4 kilometres of ice. It is in the coldest place on Earth. The water has had no air or sun for up to 25 million years. Biologists really want to study the deep water and find what strange life is there. Other scientists who study rocks and ice are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to learn the lake's secrets. If they can do it, in the next few years we will learn a lot about Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

I heard something interesting on the radio last week. Some scientists are getting upset. They are asking why they want to be scientists. We often say it is 'because it's there'. Of course, we know it is about the old search for knowledge. We want to understand everything, from the smallest things to black holes in space. But these scientists want to know why we want to know these things. They also ask why science cannot explain why we want to know.
I think it is more important to know if what we scientists are doing is correct. We should not talk too much about the reason for it. For me, the important thing is not why we do science. We need to see that science is a tool. We are the people who must choose how, where, when and why to use it.","**Othello**

An excellent production of Shakespeare's play, Othello, has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct a review I wrote that was unfair when the show first started last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the main role, and I was wrong to criticise his acting. I still believe it changes the story to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but I must admit I was wrong about the rest of Mr Fearon's wonderful performance. In fact, the entire cast is wonderful. Some unforgettable scenes are when Cassio's competitive games with the other young officers become dangerously wild, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and has to fight to calm himself down. I don't think anyone can avoid crying during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The speed and excitement of the play are excellent. You should not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the centre of Antarctica, nothing moves. On the edges of the continent, you can find many penguins, seals, and birds. But on the huge white plain inside the continent, life cannot exist. However, there is one exception: a massive hidden lake of fresh water called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometres of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. This water has been completely cut off from air and sunlight for as long as 25 million years. Biologists are very excited to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange life forms live there. Geologists and ice scientists are also very interested. For the last two years, researchers worldwide have been planning how to discover the lake's secrets. If they are successful, in the next few years we will see a time when Lake Vostok is the main focus of science.

I think the most important point is not why we do science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we are the people who should choose how, where, when, and why to use it.",,
