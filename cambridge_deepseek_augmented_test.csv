Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.,say the police.
Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window.
He went on to report that night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work.
Inspector Saunders said that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange.

According to the police, most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that house burglaries have increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when residents are out and have forgotten to lock a door or window. He added that night-time burglaries are rare because families are typically at home. However, winter afternoons are ideal for burglars due to the darkness, which makes them less visible, and because many houses are unoccupied as people are still at work. Inspector Saunders recommended leaving lights on in living rooms and bedrooms during holidays to deter burglars. He also urged neighbors to monitor other houses on the street and contact the police if they notice anything suspicious. He assured that advice on home safety is provided at no cost.","Burglars favor the afternoon hours. Police reports indicate that the majority of residential burglaries take place between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Inspector Ian Saunders disclosed to our newspaper that incidents of house burglaries have risen by over 30% in comparison to the previous year. He further stated that 67% of these burglaries occur when occupants are away and have neglected to secure a door or window. He elaborated that burglaries at night are uncommon since families are usually present at home. Conversely, winter afternoons present optimal conditions for burglars, as the early darkness conceals their activities and numerous homes remain empty with residents still at work. Inspector Saunders advised illuminating living rooms and bedrooms while on vacation to discourage potential burglars. Additionally, he encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on surrounding properties and to alert the police upon observing any unusual occurrences. He emphasized that guidance on enhancing home security is offered free of charge.","Burglars exhibit a predilection for the afternoon period. Law enforcement authorities assert that a predominant proportion of domestic burglaries transpire between the hours of 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Inspector Ian Saunders conveyed to our publication that the incidence of house burglaries has escalated by in excess of 30% relative to the preceding year. He additionally noted that 67% of such offenses are perpetrated when inhabitants have departed and omitted to fasten a door or window. He proceeded to elucidate that nocturnal burglaries are infrequent, attributable to the typical presence of families at home during those hours. In contrast, winter afternoons afford burglars advantageous circumstances, owing to the obscurity that facilitates concealment and the prevalence of unoccupied dwellings, as individuals are often still engaged in employment. Inspector Saunders recommended the activation of lights in living areas and bedrooms during absences for holidays as a deterrent measure against burglars. He also solicited the cooperation of neighbors in surveilling adjacent residences and notifying the police should any suspicious activities be detected. He affirmed that consultations on fortifying domestic security are provided gratuitously.","Burglars demonstrate a pronounced affinity for the afternoon interval. According to police analyses, the preponderance of residential burglaries occurs within the temporal bracket of 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Inspector Ian Saunders apprised our newspaper that the frequency of house burglaries has surged by more than 30 percent in comparison to the antecedent year. He further articulated that 67 percent of these incidents are executed when occupants have egressed and failed to secure an entry point, such as a door or window. Elaborating on this, he indicated that burglaries during nighttime are anomalous, given that households are customarily present at that juncture. Conversely, winter afternoons constitute an optimal epoch for burglars, as the crepuscular conditions afford enhanced concealment, and a multitude of residences remain vacant due to occupants' continued occupational engagements. Inspector Saunders advocated for the illumination of living rooms and bedrooms during holiday departures to act as a burglary deterrent. Moreover, he enjoined neighbors to maintain vigilance over proximate dwellings and to summon law enforcement upon discerning any aberrant phenomena. He concluded by affirming that expert counsel on domiciliary security enhancements is dispensed without fiscal imposition."

Hailing from France, where her birth occurred in 1761, Madame Tussaud honed her skills under the tutelage of her uncle, a physician who specialized in wax figure creation and founded a museum in Paris, with her playing an integral role in its operations. Amid the upheaval of the French Revolution in 1789, she endured incarceration and was coerced into fabricating death masks of distinguished individuals, notably Queen Marie Antoinette. Subsequent to her nuptials with Francois Tussaud in 1795, she transplanted her collection to London in 1802, establishing an institution that endures as a testament to her waxwork artistry."

7,"ESTHER'S STORY

When Esther left school at the age of sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her PS500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends decided to go to college, but Esther used her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar and some glass jars and began making her own jam. She sold the jam for PS1 a jar to her friends and she soon doubled her aunt's PS500.
At first, her parents didn't want Esther to spend her time making jam and they thought that she should study instead. They hoped that one day she would be a teacher or a doctor. But Esther didn't listen to them. She just kept on making jam. After a few months, she started selling it to the local market. Then she started making orange juice. She sold this to a school where one of her friends worked.
After two years, her business was very large and her parents were very pleased with her. She made all kinds of food which she sold to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to get some people to work for her. ",A2,"Esther left school at sixteen. Her aunt gave her 500 pounds. Esther started a business. She made jam.

After two years, her business was very large and her parents were very pleased with her. She made all kinds of food which she sold to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she had to get some people to work for her. ","When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her 500 pounds for her birthday. While her friends went to college, Esther used the money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and jars to make jam, selling each jar for 1 pound to friends and quickly doubling her money. Initially, her parents disapproved, preferring she study to become a teacher or doctor, but Esther continued making jam. After a few months, she expanded to selling at a local market and began producing orange juice, which she sold to a school. Within two years, her business grew significantly, pleasing her parents, as she produced various foods for shops and supermarkets and hired employees due to her busy schedule.","Upon leaving school at the age of sixteen, Esther received 500 pounds from her aunt Flory as a birthday gift. Unlike most of her friends who opted for college, Esther invested the money in launching her own enterprise. She purchased fruit, sugar, and glass jars to produce jam, selling it for 1 pound per jar to her friends and rapidly doubling her initial investment. Her parents initially opposed her venture, advocating for further studies with aspirations of her becoming a teacher or doctor, but Esther persisted. She soon broadened her sales to the local market and diversified into orange juice, supplying it to a school. After two years, her business had expanded considerably, earning her parents' approval as she manufactured a range of food items for retail outlets and supermarkets, necessitating the hiring of staff to manage the workload.","Having concluded her schooling at sixteen, Esther was bestowed with 500 pounds by her aunt Flory in celebration of her birthday. In contrast to the majority of her peers who pursued collegiate education, Esther allocated these funds to initiate a proprietary business. She procured fruit, sugar, and an assortment of glass jars to commence jam production, vending each jar at 1 pound to acquaintances and expeditiously augmenting her capital to 1000 pounds. Initially, her parents expressed dissent, favoring academic pursuits with the expectation that she would qualify as a teacher or physician; however, Esther remained resolute. Subsequently, she extended her commercial activities to the local market and embarked on manufacturing orange juice, which she distributed to an educational institution. Within a biennium, her enterprise had burgeoned substantially, eliciting parental satisfaction as she engineered a diverse array of comestibles for distribution through shops and supermarkets, compelling her to engage personnel to accommodate the escalating demands.","Subsequent to her departure from formal education at the age of sixteen, Esther was the recipient of a 500-pound endowment from her aunt Flory, commemorating her birthday. Diverging from the conventional path taken by most of her contemporaries, who elected to attend college, Esther deployed these resources to establish an autonomous commercial venture. She acquired fruit, sugar, and a selection of glass receptacles to fabricate preserves, retailing each jar at a pound sterling to her associates and swiftly duplicating her initial fiscal outlay. Her progenitors initially demurred, propounding the merits of scholarly advancement with the aspiration that she would ultimately secure a vocation in pedagogy or medicine; nevertheless, Esther adhered tenaciously to her course. She subsequently amplified her commercial footprint by vending at a proximate market and initiated the production of citrus nectar, which she supplied to an academic establishment. After a period of two years, her undertaking had undergone significant expansion, garnering approbation from her parents as she formulated an extensive assortment of alimentary products for dissemination through retail establishments and supermarket chains, obliging her to recruit auxiliary staff to mitigate the burgeoning operational exigencies."

In 1783, two French brothers built the first balloon to take people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew in it. This was in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office began the first airmail service. 
Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. Then, in the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. 
In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and it can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the journey from London to New York is only four hours.

By the 1950s, the integration of jet propulsion systems markedly enhanced their velocity. In 1976, Concorde was conceived through a bilateral endeavor between the United Kingdom and France. It persists as the preeminent supersonic passenger aircraft, attaining speeds of 2500 kilometers per hour, which condenses the transatlantic voyage from London to New York to a duration of only four hours.

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she went up the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London.
In 1993, Rebecca left her job and her family and travelled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. 'You must carry everything on your back,' she explained, 'so you can only take things that you will need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy so you only take enough to drink!'

Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and resided in a small flat in south London. In 1993, she left her job and family to travel to Asia with a group of climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very difficult. As she explained, you have to carry all your belongings on your back, so you can only bring essential items. Washing is impossible because there is no water, only snow, and water is too heavy to carry in large amounts, so you take just enough for drinking. On May 17, 1993, Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest, which was the best moment of her life, and she quickly became famous. Nowadays, she has written a book about her experience and is often invited to speak about it. She also has a new job presenting a science programme on television. Although she is now well-known and financially better off, she continues to live in her small flat in south London, surrounded by her mountain pictures and books.","Rebecca Stevens achieved the distinction of being the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Prior to this feat, she was employed as a journalist and inhabited a modest flat in south London. In 1993, she departed from her job and family to journey to Asia alongside fellow climbers. She found that existence on Everest is arduous; one must transport all possessions on their back, limiting items to only the most necessary. Hygiene is unattainable due to the absence of water, with only snow available, and since water is burdensome to carry, only a sufficient supply for drinking is taken. Upon reaching the summit on May 17, 1993, Rebecca experienced the pinnacle moment of her life and subsequently gained fame. Currently, she has authored a book detailing her expedition and is frequently requested to deliver talks on the subject. Additionally, she holds a new position hosting a science programme on television. Despite her increased renown and financial prosperity, she persists in residing in her small south London flat, adorned with her collection of mountain imagery and literature.","Rebecca Stevens secured her place in history as the inaugural woman to ascend Mount Everest. Before undertaking this monumental climb, she pursued a career in journalism and occupied a compact residence in south London. In 1993, she relinquished her professional duties and familial ties to embark on an expedition to Asia with a cohort of climbers. She ascertained that survival on Everest is exceedingly demanding; individuals are compelled to bear all essentials on their backs, thereby restricting provisions to absolute necessities. Maintaining personal cleanliness is impracticable owing to the scarcity of water, with merely snow at hand, and since water is ponderous, only a minimal quantity for hydration is transported. When Rebecca attained the peak on May 17, 1993, it constituted the most sublime instant of her existence, precipitating her rise to prominence. In the present day, she has composed a literary work chronicling her voyage and is regularly solicited for orations on the topic. Furthermore, she has assumed a new role as a presenter on a televised science programme. Notwithstanding her enhanced celebrity status and economic affluence, she continues to inhabit her diminutive flat in south London, enveloped by her assemblages of mountain photographs and volumes.","Rebecca Stevens etched her name into the annals of exploration by becoming the premier female to conquer Mount Everest. Prior to this formidable undertaking, she was engaged in journalism and domiciled in an unassuming flat in south London. In 1993, she abdicated her occupational and domestic commitments to voyage to Asia in the company of other mountaineers. She discerned that existence on Everest is profoundly grueling; one is obliged to porter all accoutrements on their person, thus constraining cargo to indispensable articles only. Ablutions are infeasible due to the dearth of aqueous resources, with naught but snow available, and given water's substantial mass, merely adequate amounts for potation are conveyed. Upon her ascension to the apex on May 17, 1993, Rebecca encountered the apogee of her life's experiences, which precipitously catapulted her into renown. Presently, she has authored a tome elucidating her trek and is oftentimes besought to discourse upon it. She has also secured a new vocation as an anchor on a television science broadcast. Despite her augmented notoriety and fiscal prosperity, she perpetuates her residence in the diminutive south London flat, amidst her compilations of orographic imagery and bibliographic works."

The two smaller varieties were introduced to England more than five decades ago, whereas the Giant Schnauzer has a relatively recent presence in the country. The designation 'Giant' is appropriate, given their height range of 65 to 67.5 cm. All Schnauzers possess long coats that necessitate frequent grooming. Typically, the smaller Schnauzers exhibit a grey coloration, in contrast to the Giant Schnauzer, which is predominantly black.

The majority of smaller Schnauzers display a grey hue, whereas the Giant Schnauzer is customarily black. Originating in Germany, Schnauzers are employed by agriculturists for ovine management and by law enforcement agencies due to their exceptional cognitive abilities. As domestic pets, Schnauzers prove to be congenial and exhibit exemplary behavior towards juvenile family members.","Schnauzer dogs are delineated into three size classifications. The two diminutive varieties were first introduced to England in excess of fifty years prior, whereas the Giant Schnauzer has merely a nascent presence in the region. The nomenclature 'Giant' is particularly apropos, given that these specimens reach an altitude of 65 to 67.5 cm. All Schnauzers are characterized by protracted coats that necessitate periodic shearing. Predominantly, the smaller Schnauzers manifest a grey pigmentation, in contradistinction to the Giant Schnauzer, which is invariably black. With provenance in Germany, these canines are utilized by agrarian practitioners for ovine husbandry and by constabularies owing to their pronounced intellect. In a familial context, Schnauzers serve as affable companions, demonstrating a proclivity for amicable interactions with progeny."

Capable of reaching velocities from 65 to 90 kilometres per hour, they easily evade most predators. Offspring are initially the size of chickens and undergo a three-year development to adulthood. Herbivorous by nature, ostriches consume plants and can endure prolonged periods without access to water.","The ostrich, distinguished as the largest avian species globally, attains masses exceeding 90 kilograms in adulthood. Its primary habitat is the wild regions of southern Africa, though extant populations are notably scarce. Despite possessing wings characteristic of birds, ostriches are flightless and utilise these appendages for enhanced agility and directional control whilst sprinting. Achieving remarkable speeds ranging from 65 to 90 kilometres per hour, they present a formidable challenge to potential predators. Juveniles emerge at a size comparable to chickens and necessitate approximately three years to reach full maturity. Their herbivorous diet, comprising various plants, enables survival for extended durations in the absence of water.","The ostrich, unequivocally the largest bird species worldwide, can surpass 90 kilograms in mass upon reaching adulthood. Indigenous predominantly to the wilderness of southern Africa, their numbers have precipitously declined, rendering them relatively rare. Although endowed with wings akin to all avian creatures, ostriches are incapable of aerial locomotion; rather, they deploy their wings to facilitate precise turns and balance during rapid terrestrial movement. Attaining velocities between 65 and 90 kilometres per hour, they adeptly elude pursuit by most adversaries. Progeny are born at dimensions analogous to domestic chickens and undergo a protracted developmental phase of roughly three years before achieving full-grown status. Sustained by a strictly herbivorous regimen, ostriches ingest plant matter and possess the physiological capacity to subsist for considerable intervals devoid of water intake."

It was utterly delightful to behold you once more. Herein, I enclose the photographic depictions of your progeny, which you had previously requisitioned; they are, indisputably, of superior caliber. I ardently aspire that they garner your esteemed approbation. I have cultivated an immense predilection for my nascent camera apparatus. Subsequently, in the imminent week, I shall embark on an excursion to New York to pay a visit to my sister, wherein I propose to amass a copious quantity of photographs, particularly as a substantial interlude has transpired since our last rendezvous. I reiterate my sincerest appreciation. With affection, Roy"

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer and a teacher and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes into his office and writes. In the evening, he gives the work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live near here but they also read my stories and say if they are good or bad.' And so Bill has learned what young children want to read.
Bill writes about the life in his village and on the farms near it. His fifth book is his favourite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and the dog that helps him.
'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are so clever, they learn very quickly.'
Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used the latest computer technology to make people think that the animals are speaking. Bill was very pleased with the film. 'Sometimes film- makers change books, but they didn't change mine and I love the film.'",A2,"Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist.

Now, thirteen years later, he has authored over 80 books. He writes daily in his office and gives his work to his wife in the evening for feedback; she points out parts she dislikes. Although his ten grandchildren live far away, they also read his stories and provide opinions on their quality. Through this, Bill has learned what appeals to young children. He writes about life in his village and the surrounding farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, The Sheepdog, which tells the story of a farmer and his helpful dog. Bill has always liked animals, noting that dogs are clever and quick learners. Last year, The Sheepdog was adapted into a film featuring real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced computer technology to create the illusion of animals speaking. Bill was very pleased because they did not alter his book, and he loves the final film.","Before embarking on a career as a children's author at the age of 60, Bill Prince-Smith had been a farmer, teacher, and dentist. In the thirteen years since, he has produced more than 80 books. Each day, he retreats to his office to write, and in the evenings, he presents his work to his wife for her critique; she informs him when something does not meet her approval. His ten grandchildren, though not residing nearby, also read his stories and offer their assessments, enabling Bill to understand the preferences of young readers. His writing focuses on life in his village and the farms in the vicinity. Among his works, his fifth book, The Sheepdog, holds a special place as his favorite; it depicts a farmer and the dog that assists him.

Over the subsequent thirteen years, he has authored in excess of 80 books. His daily routine involves writing in his office, after which he submits his work to his wife for evaluation; she provides feedback by indicating elements she finds unsatisfactory. Additionally, his ten grandchildren, despite living at a distance, peruse his narratives and convey their judgments, thereby facilitating Bill's comprehension of juvenile literary tastes. His oeuvre centers on depictions of village life and the adjacent agricultural settings. His fifth publication, The Sheepdog, is his most cherished work, chronicling the relationship between a farmer and his canine companion. Bill has perpetually harbored an affinity for animals, observing that dogs exhibit notable intelligence and adeptness in learning. The previous year witnessed the cinematic adaptation of The Sheepdog, featuring genuine animals and actors, with state-of-the-art computer technology deployed to create the impression of animal dialogue. Bill expressed considerable satisfaction with the film, appreciating that the filmmakers preserved the integrity of his book without alterations, and he regards the production with great admiration.","Bill Prince-Smith's professional trajectory encompassed roles as a farmer, educator, and dental practitioner before he commenced his vocation as a children's author upon reaching sixty years of age. In the intervening thirteen years, he has composed a corpus of over eighty literary works. His quotidian practice entails sequestering himself in his office to write, subsequently presenting his output to his spouse for her discerning appraisal; she articulates her dissent regarding any unsatisfactory components. Moreover, his ten grandchildren, although geographically remote, engage with his stories and proffer evaluative comments, thus instrumental in Bill's acquisition of insight into the predilections of young readers. His literary productions are characterized by their portrayal of bucolic existence within his village and the encompassing farmlands. Among his publications, his fifth endeavor, The Sheepdog, is esteemed as his paramount favorite, delineating the symbiosis between an agriculturist and his auxiliary dog. Bill has consistently maintained a profound appreciation for fauna, extolling the cognitive acuity and expeditious learning capacities of canines. The antecedent year saw the transmutation of The Sheepdog into a cinematic rendition, incorporating veritable animals and thespians, with cutting-edge computational techniques employed to engender the verisimilitude of zoological vocalization. Bill evinced profound gratification with the filmic interpretation, lauding the filmmakers' fidelity to his original text sans modifications, and he holds the adaptation in the highest esteem."
21,"Otters 

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and
make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their
homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 
10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes. 
Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The water in the rivers was so dirty that many fish and insects died and the otters couldn't find anything to eat. But today there is lots of food for them because the rivers are clean again.

","Otters are not often seen by people. They live near rivers and build their homes from small wood pieces. They are usually active at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim over 10 kilometres per hour. Their thick brown fur keeps them warm in water. Otters can close their ears and nose, allowing them to stay underwater for several minutes. Twenty years ago, otters were rare in Great Britain because the dirty rivers killed fish and insects, leaving no food for otters. However, today the rivers are clean again, providing plenty of food for them.","Otters are seldom observed by people, as they inhabit areas near rivers and construct their dens from small pieces of wood. They are primarily nocturnal, emerging from their homes at night. Otters are highly adept in aquatic environments, capable of swimming at speeds exceeding 10 kilometres per hour. Their dense brown fur provides insulation against the cold water. Additionally, otters can seal their ears and nostrils, enabling them to remain submerged for several minutes. Two decades ago, otter populations in Great Britain were scarce due to polluted rivers that decimated fish and insect life, depriving otters of sustenance. Presently, with the rivers restored to cleanliness, otters have an abundant food supply.","Otters are infrequently encountered by humans, residing in riparian zones where they fashion their dens from diminutive wood fragments. These creatures are predominantly nocturnal, venturing forth under the cover of darkness. Exhibiting remarkable aquatic prowess, otters can attain swimming velocities of over 10 kilometres per hour. Their luxuriant brown pelage affords them thermal protection in chilly waters. Furthermore, otters possess the ability to occlude their auditory and nasal passages, facilitating submersion for extended periods of several minutes. Two decades prior, otter numbers in Great Britain were markedly diminished, a consequence of river pollution that eradicated piscine and insect populations, thereby eliminating the otters' food sources. In contemporary times, however, the rejuvenation of river purity has reinstated a plentiful food reservoir for these mammals.","Otters are rarely sighted by individuals, inhabiting fluvial environments where they meticulously construct their abodes from minute wooden components. These mammals are chiefly crepuscular or nocturnal, typically emerging from their dwellings during the night. Demonstrating exceptional aquatic agility, otters can achieve swimming speeds in excess of 10 kilometres per hour. Their dense, brown fur serves as an effective insulator against hypothermia in aquatic settings. Moreover, otters can hermetically seal their aural and nasal orifices, permitting prolonged submersion for several minutes. Two decades ago, the otter populace in Great Britain was severely depleted, owing to contaminated waterways that precipitated the demise of ichthyic and entomological species, thus depriving otters of nutritional resources. In the present era, the remediation of river systems has engendered a resurgence in food availability, supporting otter populations."

However, after concerts, they find it difficult to sleep because their mind is filled with music. Exercise is also important; before a car accident, they spent two and a half hours daily, five days a week, at the sports centre. Now, they do about 150 sit-ups each day.

Adequate sleep is essential; they manage ten hours of sleep when returning to their mother's home, yet post-concert nights are challenging due to music preoccupying their thoughts. Physical activity holds significance; prior to a car accident, they dedicated two and a half hours per day, five days a week, to the sports centre, but now they compensate with approximately 150 daily sit-ups. They abstain from alcohol and tobacco and strive for a balanced diet. Hydration is prioritized, with a goal of eight glasses of water daily for health benefits, though this isn't always met.

Following medical guidance to enhance their nutrition, they no longer experience fatigue and incorporate items like carrots and spinach into their daily meals, while still permitting themselves burgers on occasion.","The Irish pop ensemble Boyzone exemplifies a health-conscious existence. Securing sufficient rest is paramount; they attain ten hours of slumber upon visiting their maternal residence, yet nocturnal repose proves elusive after performances owing to cerebral saturation with musical themes. Physical exertion is integral; preceding an automotive mishap, they allocated two and a half hours daily across five weekly sessions at the athletic facility, presently substituting this regimen with a daily quota of roughly 150 abdominal contractions.

Furthermore, they emphasize hydration, targeting eight tumblers of water per diem for salubrious effects, albeit not consistently realized. They posit that incessant labor is inadvisable; while fervently devoted to their vocation, they engage in avocational pursuits like auditory immersion in melodies or televisual viewing, acknowledging the merit of intermittent repose. Subsequent to heeding a physician's counsel to refine their alimentation, they have eradicated weariness, routinely consuming comestibles such as carrots and spinach, yet they intermittently partake in hamburgers.","The Irish pop collective Boyzone embodies a regimen of salubrious living. Procuring ample somnolence is of utmost import; they luxuriate in decennial hours of repose when sojourning at their matrilineal abode, notwithstanding the impediment to nocturnal rest following concerts, attributable to a psyche inundated with melodic reverberations. Athletic engagement is indispensable; antecedent to an vehicular incident, they devoted two and a half hours diurnally, quinquies per week, to the sports complex, a practice now supplanted by the execution of approximately 150 daily sit-ups. They rigorously abstain from ethanol and tobacco, assiduously pursuing an optimal dietary protocol. Concomitantly, they prioritize aqueous consumption, aspiring to imbibe eight goblets quotidianly for its healthful properties, though this objective is not invariably attained. They contend that perpetual occupational endeavors are ill-advised; whilst ardently committed to their profession, they cultivate diversions such as aural appreciation of music or televisual spectatorship, extolling the virtues of sporadic quiescence. In the wake of medical exhortations to ameliorate their nutritional intake, they have obviated lassitude, incorporating comestibles like carrots and spinach into their quotidian fare, yet they countenance the occasional indulgence in burgers."

In a park in a small town in central England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers.

Hundreds of young people phoned the radio and asked the disc jockey to play the songs once more.

However, last week he was in Tokyo, and millions of Japanese people watched him on television because he is currently the top singer in Japan. John visited Japan a few months ago to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on the radio, leading to hundreds of young people phoning in to request the songs again.

His wife Denise, who works at a hospital, believes this success will not alter their lifestyle, as she only knows him as John Pickering.","John Pickering is employed as a gardener in a park located in a small town in central England, where his duties include mowing the lawn and watering the flowers. Despite this, he spent the entire previous week in Tokyo, where he was televised and viewed by millions of Japanese citizens, as he has become the foremost singer in Japan at present. A few months earlier, John traveled to Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey discovered his music and featured it on his radio program, prompting hundreds of young listeners to call and request replays. Performing under the stage name Jon Otis in Japan, John intends to maintain his gardening position, as he is uncertain about his potential music income and emphasizes the necessity of covering his expenses. His colleagues in the park are ignorant of his celebrity status and have never encountered his singing.

Nevertheless, he was in Tokyo throughout the preceding week, captivating a television audience of millions in Japan, owing to his current status as the preeminent singer in the country. Several months prior, John journeyed to Japan to deliver performances in dance clubs located in Osaka and Nagoya. Subsequently, a disc jockey encountered his musical compositions and broadcast them on his radio show, which incited hundreds of youthful enthusiasts to telephone the station and petition for repeated airings. While employing the pseudonym Jon Otis for his musical endeavors in Japan, John has resolved not to relinquish his horticultural occupation, as he remains apprehensive about his prospective earnings from music and underscores the imperative of meeting his financial obligations. His fellow gardeners are completely uninformed about his renown and have never been exposed to his vocal talents. Denise, his spouse who is employed in a hospital, contends that this acclaim will not precipitate any alterations in their existence, affirming that she solely acknowledges John Pickering, disavowing any association with Jon Otis.","In a park within a modest town in central England, John Pickering undertakes the responsibilities of a gardener, which encompass mowing the turf and irrigating the floral arrangements. Conversely, he devoted the entirety of the previous week to sojourning in Tokyo, where he was featured on television and observed by a multitude of Japanese viewers, as he presently holds the distinction of being the paramount vocalist in Japan. His foray into the Japanese music scene commenced several months ago with performances at dance establishments in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey, upon hearing his compositions, incorporated them into his radio broadcast, eliciting a deluge of calls from numerous young adherents who entreated for encore presentations. Adopting the moniker Jon Otis for his artistic pursuits in Japan, John is disinclined to abandon his horticultural post, given his uncertainty regarding potential remuneration from his musical career and his insistence on the necessity of discharging his pecuniary liabilities. His colleagues in the park remain oblivious to his celebrity and have never had the opportunity to appreciate his singing. Denise, his consort who is engaged in hospital work, posits that this newfound fame will not engender any modifications to their quotidian existence, professing familiarity solely with John Pickering and repudiating any cognizance of the persona Jon Otis."

33,"THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 London had no policemen at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night and they were not paid very much.
About 300 years ago, London was starting to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people stayed in their homes as much as possible.
In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street.
Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was started with 3000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. Until 1920 all the police in London were men.

Today, London police are quite well paid and for the few police officers who still ride horses, the pay is even better than for the others.","The history of the London police shows big changes. Today, police officers are common in London, but in 1700, there were none. A few elderly men protected the city streets at night and received low pay. Around 300 years ago, London was expanding and became very dirty, with many poor people. Thieves were numerous, stealing money in the streets, so people often stayed indoors. In 1750, Henry Fielding organized a paid group to catch thieves, similar to police, known as the 'Bow Street Runners' from their work near Bow Street. By 1800, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London's growth required more police. Thus, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established with 3000 officers, most on foot and some on horseback. Until 1920, all London police were men. Nowadays, London police are well paid, and those on horseback earn even higher salaries.","The evolution of the London police force illustrates significant developments over time. Presently, policemen are ubiquitous in London, yet in the 18th century, the city lacked any formal police presence. A handful of elderly men guarded the streets at night for minimal compensation. Approximately three centuries ago, as London began to expand, it was characterized by filth and widespread poverty. The prevalence of thieves who pilfered money in public areas led residents to remain indoors as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding initiated a paid group to apprehend thieves, functioning as early policemen and dubbed the 'Bow Street Runners' due to their base near Bow Street. After fifty years, their numbers reached 120, but London's considerable growth necessitated a larger force. Consequently, in 1829, the inaugural Metropolitan Police Force was launched with 3000 officers, predominantly patrolling on foot, though a minority utilized horses. All police personnel in London were male until 1920. In contemporary times, London police receive substantial remuneration, with mounted officers enjoying even superior pay.","The historical trajectory of the London police force delineates a profound transformation. In contemporary London, police officers are omnipresent; however, during the early 18th century, the metropolis entirely lacked a structured police system. A limited number of aged individuals undertook nocturnal street patrols, receiving meager remuneration. Around 300 years prior, as London commenced its expansion, the urban environment was marked by squalor and extensive impoverishment. The ubiquity of thieves engaging in monetary theft in public thoroughfares compelled citizens to minimize their outdoor activities. In 1750, Henry Fielding established a remunerated cohort to combat thievery, serving as proto-policemen and denominated the 'Bow Street Runners' owing to their operational vicinity to Bow Street. By the turn of the 19th century, this group had expanded to 120 members, yet London's exponential growth demanded a more extensive policing apparatus. Thus, in 1829, the inaugural Metropolitan Police Force was instituted, comprising 3000 officers who primarily conducted foot patrols, with a contingent employing equestrian units. The police force remained exclusively male until 1920. In the modern era, London police are accorded competitive salaries, with equestrian officers receiving even more lucrative compensation.","The annals of the London police force chronicle a remarkable evolution from its nascent stages to its current incarnation. In present-day London, law enforcement officers are pervasively deployed, yet in the annum 1700, the city was devoid of any formal policing entity. A scant assembly of elderly men performed nocturnal vigil over the urban thoroughfares, garnering only nominal financial recompense. Circa three centuries ago, as London embarked upon its territorial augmentation, the municipality was afflicted by profound insalubrity and pervasive indigence. The preponderance of larcenists who expropriated monetary assets in public domains induced the populace to largely confine themselves to their domiciles. In 1750, Henry Fielding orchestrated a salaried contingent to intercept malefactors, functioning as incipient policemen and appellated the 'Bow Street Runners' in reference to their operational locus proximate to Bow Street. After a quinquagenary interval, their complement had swelled to 120, but London's monumental expansion mandated a more capacious constabulary. Ergo, in 1829, the seminal Metropolitan Police Force was inaugurated, fielding 3000 officers who predominantly engaged in pedestrian patrols, albeit a minority utilized equine transport. The entirety of London's police personnel remained masculinely constituted until 1920. In contemporary contexts, London police are endowed with substantial remuneration, with those undertaking mounted duties accruing even more eminent financial rewards."

Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and slowly their villages got bigger.

","Before farming began, people searched forests for edible plants and fruits, which required constant movement to find sustenance. Approximately 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started cultivating crops, becoming the first farmers. This allowed communities to settle in one location, leading to the growth of villages. As a result, some individuals were freed to pursue other occupations, such as clothing production, since farmers could supply food for everyone. However, farming faced challenges during poor weather, sometimes causing food shortages. Today, agricultural advancements enable farmers to produce more food, which is transported over long distances to reach consumers.","Prior to the advent of agriculture, humans foraged in forests for edible plants and fruits, necessitating a nomadic lifestyle in search of nourishment. Around 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people initiated crop cultivation, marking the origins of farming. This development facilitated permanent settlements, allowing villages to expand over time. Consequently, some members of society could specialize in other trades, like textile manufacturing, as farmers provided a stable food supply. Nevertheless, agriculture was susceptible to adverse weather conditions, occasionally resulting in insufficient food for some. In contemporary times, farmers achieve higher yields, and produce is distributed across vast distances to households.","Before the establishment of agricultural practices, human societies engaged in foraging within forests to procure edible flora and fruits, which imposed a migratory existence to secure sustenance. Approximately 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, communities commenced the cultivation of crops, thereby pioneering farming. This innovation enabled the formation of sedentary settlements, progressively leading to the enlargement of villages. As a consequence, certain individuals were emancipated to undertake alternative vocations, such as garment production, owing to the farmers' capacity to sustain the populace with food. However, agricultural endeavors were fraught with difficulties during inclement weather, periodically engendering food inadequacies. In the modern era, farmers attain enhanced productivity, and agricultural commodities are transported over extensive trajectories to domestic residences.","Prior to the inception of agrarian methodologies, human populations subsisted by gathering edible vegetation and fruits from forests, which necessitated a peripatetic lifestyle in pursuit of nourishment. Roughly 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, societies initiated the domestication and cultivation of crops, thus inaugurating the practice of farming. This paradigm shift facilitated the establishment of permanent habitations, culminating in the gradual expansion of villages. Consequently, segments of the population were liberated to engage in specialized occupations, such as the fabrication of apparel, as agriculturalists could provision the collective with sustenance. Nonetheless, farming was impeded by meteorological adversities, intermittently precipitating alimentary deficits. In contemporary contexts, agriculturalists achieve augmented yields, and produce is conveyed across thousands of kilometers to domiciles."

40,"Corryvale Farm

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep.
She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts this wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash.
That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present.

Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She owns 50 sheep, and each one produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to prevent them from overheating. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and attempted to sell them at country markets. But since it was summer and the weather was hot, people were not interested in buying sweaters. She then decided to make socks instead. Everyone loved the socks because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. That was the beginning of Jenny's business. Initially, she produced the socks at home, but as the number of customers grew into the thousands, she had to send the wool to a factory. Now, all the socks are manufactured by machines. The socks come in six colors, five sizes suitable for all ages, and different types for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. On the walls of her office, there are numerous letters from satisfied customers worldwide.","Corryvale Farm is situated in the west of England, where Stephen and Jenny Blackler maintain a herd of cows and a flock of chickens, from which they derive income by selling milk and eggs. Nevertheless, the majority of their earnings originate from Jenny's sheep. She possesses 50 sheep, each yielding sufficient wool for the production of six sweaters. Biannually, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to ensure they do not become excessively warm. Five years ago, Jenny crafted several sweaters using this wool and endeavored to market them at rural fairs. However, as it was summertime with high temperatures, there was little demand for sweaters. Subsequently, she began manufacturing socks, which were met with widespread approval due to their low cost, robustness, and ease of maintenance. This initiative marked the inception of Jenny's enterprise. Initially, she fabricated the socks domestically, but the rapid expansion to thousands of clients necessitated outsourcing the wool to a factory, where the socks are now mechanically produced. The product range includes six hues, five sizes catering to all age groups, and specialized versions for hikers, sports enthusiasts, and skiers. Jenny experiences peak activity around Christmas, as Corryvale socks are highly favored as presents. Adorning the walls of her office are numerous correspondences from contented customers across the globe.","Corryvale Farm, located in the western region of England, is operated by Stephen and Jenny Blackler, who raise cattle and poultry, generating revenue through the sale of milk and eggs. However, the predominant source of their income is derived from Jenny's ovine livestock. She manages a flock of 50 sheep, each producing an ample quantity of wool capable of fabricating six sweaters. Semiannually, Stephen undertakes the shearing of the wool to prevent the sheep from overheating. Half a decade ago, Jenny utilized this wool to create sweaters and attempted to vend them at country markets, but the endeavor was unsuccessful owing to the sweltering summer conditions, which diminished demand for such garments. She then pivoted to producing socks, which garnered immediate acclaim for their affordability, durability, and washability. This venture catalyzed the establishment of Jenny's business. In its nascent stages, she manufactured the socks within her home, yet the swift accumulation of a clientele numbering in the thousands compelled her to delegate wool processing to a factory, where all socks are now industrially manufactured. The assortment encompasses six distinct colors, five sizes accommodating all demographics, and variants tailored for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny encounters her busiest period during the Christmas season, as Corryvale socks are a preferred gift choice. The walls of her office are adorned with a multitude of letters from elated patrons spanning the globe.","Nestled in the western expanse of England, Corryvale Farm is helmed by Stephen and Jenny Blackler, who sustain a bovine and avian husbandry operation, vending milk and eggs as part of their agrarian pursuits. Notwithstanding these endeavors, the lion's share of their financial proceeds emanates from Jenny's caprine holdings. She oversees a contingent of 50 sheep, each yielding a copious amount of wool sufficient for the construction of six sweaters. At six-month intervals, Stephen performs the shearing ritual to obviate any risk of the sheep becoming unduly heated. A quinquennium past, Jenny fashioned an array of sweaters from this wool and endeavored to merchandise them at rustic fairs, yet the venture foundered due to the torrid summer climate, which stifled consumer interest in woolen apparel. Consequently, she transitioned to crafting socks, which were instantly embraced for their economical pricing, resilience, and facile laundering properties. This innovation heralded the genesis of Jenny's commercial enterprise. Initially, she fabricated the socks in a domestic setting, but the exponential growth to a multitude of patrons necessitated the outsourcing of wool to a manufacturing facility, where all socks are now produced via mechanized processes. The product line features a sextet of hues, quintuple sizing options for all age cohorts, and specialized designs for pedestrians, athletic participants, and alpine skiers. Jenny's schedule is most frenetic during the Yuletide season, as Corryvale socks are a coveted present. The perimeter of her office is embellished with a profusion of epistolary testimonials from gratified clientele across the international sphere."

The structure was circular, lacked a roof, and exposed attendees to the elements, often leaving them cold and damp in inclement weather. The queen was particularly fond of attending performances of William Shakespeare's works at this venue by the River Thames. During that era, all actors were male, and audiences commonly engaged in activities such as eating, conversing with companions, strolling about during the performance, and occasionally hurling objects at the performers. In the present day, the Globe Theatre remains accessible; a reconstructed version occupies the original site, offering opportunities to enjoy Shakespearean drama or gain insights into seventeenth-century life.","Attending the Globe Theatre in London four hundred years ago presented a stark divergence from contemporary theatre-going practices. The edifice was characterized by its circular design and absence of a roof, rendering patrons susceptible to discomfort from adverse weather conditions. The monarch held a particular affinity for witnessing William Shakespeare's theatrical productions at this establishment situated along the River Thames. In that historical context, all theatrical roles were exclusively performed by men, and spectators frequently partook in dining, social discourse, perambulation during performances, with some individuals even resorting to projectile actions towards the actors. Presently, the Globe Theatre endures as a destination; a modern reconstruction inhabits the original riverside locale, facilitating the appreciation of Shakespearean works or the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to seventeenth-century existence.","The experience of patronizing the Globe Theatre in London during the early seventeenth century diverged profoundly from modern theatrical engagements. The architecture, being circular and unroofed, subjected attendees to the vagaries of the climate, often resulting in considerable discomfort during inclement conditions. Her Majesty the Queen exhibited a pronounced predilection for the dramatic oeuvre of William Shakespeare, frequently attending performances at this venue adjacent to the River Thames. In that epoch, thespian roles were universally enacted by males, and the audience comportment included gastronomic consumption, convivial interactions, ambulatory movements throughout the spectacle, and on occasion, the hurling of projectiles at the performers. In contemporary times, the Globe Theatre persists as an accessible institution; a meticulously reconstructed facility occupies the historic site, affording opportunities for the appreciation of Shakespearean drama or scholarly inquiry into the quotidian realities of the seventeenth century."

Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys who grew up in the same small Canadian town.
They have always been friends and classmates. Like all their other friends, they enjoy going fishing or swimming at weekends. But for the last few months, they've spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This isn't because they have a lot of homework. They have made a new computer word game.

His brother wanted to help. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to make a computer game and now it's ready to use. It's a speaking and picture game. For example, if you look at the word 'hat', there's a drawing of a hat next to it and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time.

Frazer and Peter, both 14 years old, grew up in the same small Canadian town and have been lifelong friends and classmates. While they typically spend weekends fishing or swimming with friends, recently they have dedicated every weekend to working on Peter's laptop. Their motivation was not homework but the creation of a novel computer word game. The concept originated from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who experiences difficulties with reading and learns more effectively through visual and auditory methods. In response, Frazer and Peter invested over 200 hours in developing a game that combines speech and imagery; for example, displaying the word 'hat' alongside a drawing and an audio clip of Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!'. Their efforts have earned them numerous awards, and the game is set to be released worldwide soon, with many schools expressing interest in acquiring it.","An excellent concept! Frazer and Peter, two adolescents aged 14, were raised in an identical small Canadian community and have maintained a enduring friendship as classmates. Although they customarily engage in recreational pursuits such as fishing or swimming during weekends, in recent months they have devoted their entire weekends to collaborative work on Peter's laptop. This endeavor was not academic but involved the development of an innovative computer-based word game. The inspiration derived from Frazer's younger sibling, Kevin, who encounters challenges with literacy and assimilates vocabulary more readily through pictorial and auditory stimuli. Consequently, Frazer and Peter expended in excess of 200 hours crafting a game that integrates spoken language and visual aids; for instance, the term 'hat' is presented with an illustrative sketch and a vocalization of 'Hat! Hat!'. Their creation has garnered multiple accolades and is poised for international distribution, attracting considerable interest from educational institutions seeking to procure it.","A truly ingenious notion! Frazer and Peter, both fourteen-year-old youths, were nurtured within the confines of the same diminutive Canadian township, sustaining a perennial camaraderie and scholastic partnership. Whilst they ordinarily partake in leisurely activities like angling or aquatic recreation during weekends, for the preceding several months, they have allocated every weekend to intensive labor on Peter's portable computer. This undertaking was not precipitated by academic obligations but by the conception of an original computerized lexical game. The genesis of this idea stemmed from Frazer's junior brother, Kevin, who grapples with reading deficiencies and demonstrates enhanced lexical acquisition through multimodal inputs involving imagery and acoustics. In a concerted effort, Frazer and Peter dedicated over two hundred hours to engineer a game that amalgamates oral articulation and pictorial elements; exempli gratia, the lexeme 'hat' is accompanied by a graphic depiction and an auditory excerpt of Peter enunciating 'Hat! Hat!'. Their innovation has accrued a plethora of honors and is imminently scheduled for global commercialization, with a multitude of scholastic establishments evincing a keen propensity for its acquisition."

She didn't tell me she needed to use it. I'm really angry with her. 
I hope you have some good news! Write back today if you can.

","Hi Anna, I'm having a bad week. Yesterday, my volleyball team had a match, but we lost because the other team played much better. Then, my friend Jeff, who is in Australia, called with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he has a summer job, so we can't go camping together. Also, this morning, my sister got up late and rode my bike to school without telling me. I'm really angry about that. I hope you have some good news. Please write back today if possible.","Hi Anna, I'm not having a very good week. Yesterday, my team played in a volleyball match, but we were defeated as the opposing team performed significantly better. Subsequently, my friend Jeff, who resides in Australia, telephoned with unfortunate news: he is unable to visit us during the holidays due to securing a summer job, which means our planned camping trip is cancelled. Moreover, this morning, my sister overslept and consequently used my bicycle to get to school without informing me beforehand, leaving me quite frustrated. I hope you have some positive updates; please respond today if you can.","Dear Anna, I must confess this week has been rather disappointing. Yesterday, my volleyball team competed in a match, yet we suffered a loss as the opposing team demonstrated superior performance. Following that, I received a call from my friend Jeff, who is based in Australia, conveying regrettable news: he will not be able to stay with us over the holidays owing to his acquisition of a summer job, thereby nullifying our intended camping excursion. Additionally, this morning, my sister arose late and proceeded to ride my bicycle to school without prior consultation, an action that has provoked considerable irritation on my part. I sincerely hope you have more favorable developments to share; I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.","Greetings Anna, I regret to inform you that my week has been fraught with misfortunes. Yesterday, my volleyball team engaged in a competitive match, only to be bested by opponents whose prowess far exceeded our own. Subsequently, I was contacted by my friend Jeff, currently residing in Australia, who imparted disheartening news: his planned visit during the holidays has been precluded by his commitment to a summer occupation, consequently aborting our anticipated camping venture. Compounding these setbacks, this morning my sister, having overslept, appropriated my bicycle for her journey to school without soliciting my permission, an oversight that has incited profound vexation. I earnestly hope your circumstances are more auspicious; I would be grateful for a prompt response."

All cats need good eyes, because they catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast, and very strong. ","There are many types of cats, which vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, reaching up to 3.7 meters in length. Unlike most cats, tigers often rest in water to cool down. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups and hunt together for food. They prefer open, flat areas where they can easily spot and follow other animals. All cats have excellent eyesight, speed, and strength, which help them catch smaller animals for food.","A variety of cat species exist, differing significantly in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers hold the title of the largest cats, with lengths that can extend to 3.7 meters from head to tail. In contrast to many other felines, tigers frequently seek relief from heat by lying in pools of water. Lions are distinctive for forming large social groups, where they cooperate in hunting to provide food for the pride. They typically inhabit flat, open landscapes that afford them long-range visibility to track prey. All cats possess keen eyesight, remarkable speed, and considerable strength, essential traits for capturing smaller animals as their primary food source.","The feline family encompasses a diverse array of species, each exhibiting distinct variations in size, physical characteristics, and behavioral patterns. Tigers, as the most sizable members, can attain lengths of up to 3.7 meters from head to tail and are notable for their propensity to immerse themselves in water to mitigate heat, a behavior uncommon among most felids. Lions are exceptional in their social structure, residing in extensive prides where collective hunting strategies are employed to secure sustenance. These predators favor expansive, unobstructed terrains that facilitate optimal visibility for stalking and pursuing prey. Fundamentally, all cats are endowed with acute visual acuity, exceptional velocity, and formidable strength, which are indispensable for their carnivorous diet reliant on capturing smaller fauna.","Within the taxonomic group of felids, there exists a remarkable diversity of species, characterized by substantial disparities in dimensions, morphological attributes, and ethological tendencies. Tigers, occupying the apex in terms of size, may measure up to 3.7 meters in total length and exhibit an atypical inclination for aquatic immersion as a thermoregulatory mechanism during periods of elevated temperature. Lions are distinguished by their gregarious nature, forming cohesive social units wherein collaborative predation ensures the procurement of nutritional resources for the collective. Their preferred habitats comprise vast, undulating plains that provide extensive sightlines, enabling efficient tracking and pursuit of quarry. Inherent to all feline species are superlative visual capabilities, prodigious swiftness, and immense physical power, which are quintessential for their role as obligate carnivores predating upon smaller animal species."

'Bollywood', which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.
Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million.

'Bollywood', which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.
Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million.
Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, who some people say is India's greatest actor, is different. He has been the star of more than 140 films during an acting career of almost 40 years.","Bollywood is the name for the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films. This number is much higher than in the USA, making Bollywood the largest film industry globally. Most Indians prefer watching films over other leisure activities, and ten million people visit cinemas daily. Bollywood films typically feature romantic love stories, with singing and dancing as key elements. These films are popular outside India as well. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million from international sales. Indian actors make more films annually than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. As a result, most Bollywood films cost around $2 million to produce, while Hollywood films never cost less than $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work intensely for only a few years. However, Amitabh Bachchan, often considered India's greatest actor, has starred in more than 140 films over a career spanning nearly 40 years.","Bollywood, the film industry based in Mumbai, India, produces approximately 1,000 films annually. Having released its first film in 1913, Bollywood has since amassed a total of over 29,000 films, a figure that surpasses that of the USA and establishes it as the world's largest film industry. The majority of Indians favor film-watching above all other recreational pursuits, with ten million attending cinemas every day. Bollywood films are characterized by romantic narratives, and singing and dancing are integral components of each production. These films enjoy popularity beyond India's borders; last year, Bollywood generated over $500 million from exports to other nations. Although Indian actors appear in more films per year than their Hollywood counterparts, they receive lower compensation, which explains why most Bollywood films are produced for about $2 million, whereas Hollywood films invariably cost a minimum of $5 million. The majority of Bollywood actors are young and endure demanding schedules for a limited period. In contrast, Amitabh Bachchan, widely regarded as India's finest actor, has featured in more than 140 films throughout a career that has lasted almost 40 years.","Bollywood, denoting the cinematic industry headquartered in Mumbai, India, yields close to 1,000 films per annum. Since its inception with the inaugural film in 1913, Bollywood has accumulated a repertoire exceeding 29,000 films, a volume that substantially outstrips that of the United States and thereby cements its status as the preeminent film industry worldwide. Film-viewing is the predominant leisure activity among Indians, with a daily cinema attendance of ten million individuals. Bollywood productions are distinguished by their romantic storylines, with musical and dance sequences constituting essential facets of every film. These cinematic works have garnered international acclaim; in the preceding year, Bollywood accrued over $500 million from the sale of films to foreign markets. Indian actors participate in a greater number of films annually compared to American actors in Hollywood, yet they command inferior remuneration, a factor that accounts for the typical production cost of approximately $2 million for Bollywood films, in stark contrast to Hollywood's minimum expenditure of $5 million per film. The Bollywood acting cohort is predominantly youthful, enduring rigorous workloads for transient careers. Conversely, Amitabh Bachchan, frequently acclaimed as India's paramount actor, has headlined more than 140 films over a professional tenure spanning nearly four decades.","Bollywood, the sobriquet for India's film industry centered in Mumbai, generates nearly 1,000 motion pictures annually. Commencing with its maiden production in 1913, Bollywood has since amassed a corpus of over 29,000 films, a tally that vastly exceeds that of the United States, thereby affirming its supremacy as the globe's most prolific cinematic enterprise. Cinematic consumption is the favored pastime for the majority of Indians, with ten million patrons frequenting theaters each day. Bollywood's oeuvre is typified by amorous narratives, wherein musical interludes and choreographed dances are indispensable constituents. These films have achieved transnational popularity; in the previous fiscal year, Bollywood realized in excess of $500 million from international distribution. While Indian thespians feature in a higher annual output of films than their Hollywood peers, they are remunerated less generously, elucidating why the average Bollywood production is budgeted at approximately $2 million, as opposed to Hollywood's inviolable floor of $5 million. The acting fraternity in Bollywood is largely composed of youthful individuals who withstand arduous schedules for ephemeral careers. In contradistinction, Amitabh Bachchan, often heralded as India's preeminent actor, has graced more than 140 films across a thespian journey enduring almost 40 years."

59,"The Elephant Show 

by Daniel Allsop, age 14 

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we took a trip to a park not far from our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens but we were only interested in the elephant show. 
We went straight to a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. 
Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.

","Last summer, I visited Thailand with my family for a beach holiday. One day, we went to a park near our hotel. It had lovely flower gardens, but we wanted to see the elephant show. We sat in a large square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of big white cards. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint. The keepers gave them new brushes with paint and took the old ones away. Slowly, the elephants followed instructions and made pictures: one of a river, one of a tree, and one of flowers. I was amazed! When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy them. We gave the elephants our bananas from lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in forests, but now the smartest ones live in special centers where visitors can watch them.","During a beach holiday in Thailand last summer with my family, we visited a park not far from our hotel. Although the park featured beautiful flower gardens, our main interest was the elephant show. We proceeded directly to a large square area with seating on three sides, where three elephants entered accompanied by their keepers. Each elephant positioned itself before a substantial white card and was provided with a paintbrush. The keepers periodically exchanged the brushes, supplying fresh ones loaded with paint. Under the guidance of their keepers, the elephants gradually created paintings on the cards. I was astonished by the sight; one depiction illustrated a river, another a tree, and the third a bouquet of flowers. When the keepers displayed the completed artworks, there was widespread interest in purchasing them. We offered the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Historically, two decades ago, elephants were employed in forest work, but presently, the most intelligent among them reside in specialized centers open to public viewing.","While on a beach holiday in Thailand with my family last summer, we embarked on an excursion to a park in close proximity to our hotel. The park boasted exquisite flower gardens; however, our focus was exclusively on the elephant performance. We made our way to a spacious square flanked by seating on three sides, where three elephants, accompanied by their handlers, made an entrance. Each elephant was stationed before a large white card and furnished with a paintbrush. The keepers intermittently replaced the brushes, ensuring a continuous supply of paint. Adhering to their keepers' directives, the elephants meticulously executed paintings on the cards. The spectacle left me incredulous; one artwork portrayed a river, another a tree, and the third an arrangement of flowers. Upon the keepers presenting the finished paintings, a surge of interest emerged among the audience to acquire them. We presented the elephants with the bananas intended for our lunch. Two decades prior, elephants were utilized in forestry operations, but in contemporary times, the most astute of these creatures inhabit dedicated centers where they can be observed by visitors.","Amidst a familial beach holiday in Thailand last summer, we ventured to a park situated a short distance from our accommodation. The park was adorned with resplendent flower gardens, yet our attention was captivated solely by the elephant exhibition. We proceeded to an expansive square arena with tiered seating on three sides, wherein three elephants, escorted by their mahouts, made their appearance. Each pachyderm was positioned before a substantial white canvas and equipped with a paintbrush. The attendants periodically substituted the brushes, administering fresh ones saturated with pigment. In compliance with their keepers' instructions, the elephants diligently rendered compositions upon the cards. I was utterly astounded by the display; one depicted a flowing river, another a solitary tree, and the third a vibrant cluster of flowers. When the mahouts elevated the completed masterpieces for view, a fervent desire to procure them pervaded the spectators. We proffered the elephants the bananas we had reserved for our luncheon. Historically, twenty years ago, elephants were engaged in labor within forests, whereas presently, the most intellectually advanced specimens reside in specialized facilities accessible to the public for observation."

This itinerary, spanning approximately five days, is particularly favored by tourists. Nevertheless, merely half of the aspirants achieve the summit, often hindered by the precipitous alterations in weather conditions. The ascent commences in a hot, humid climate but transitions to a frigid, snow-covered apex where temperatures may plummet below 20 degrees. Thus, it is imperative for climbers to equip themselves with both sunglasses and insulated garments.","Mount Kilimanjaro, the preeminent peak in Africa, has been scaled by an extensive spectrum of individuals, encompassing a septuagenarian of 87 years and a child as young as seven. A variety of pathways facilitate the ascent, with the five-kilometer Marangu route generally esteemed as the most facile. This popular trajectory necessitates a duration of roughly five days for completion. However, a mere fifty percent of those endeavoring to summit succeed, frequently due to the capricious and abrupt meteorological transformations. The expedition originates in torrid, humid environs but culminates in a glacial, snow-laden zenith where temperatures can descend below 20 degrees.

These colossal forms are underpinned by four abbreviated limbs, each equipped with a tridactyl foot. Despite a propensity for languid ambulation, they possess the capacity for accelerated locomotion, reaching speeds of 50 kilometres per hour. In disposition, rhinos are ordinarily placid and unaggressive, adhering to a strictly herbivorous diet of grasses and botanical matter. Neonates emerge at approximately 40 kilograms subsequent to a fifteen-month gestational period. Adults frequently exceed 200 kilograms in heft and can potentially survive for half a century."

In Perth, the environs boast extensive aureate beaches, eminent restaurants proffering sumptuous gastronomy in idyllic settings, luxuriant verdant parks, and the resplendent Swan River, all perused during a city tour. Alice Springs is attained via an aerial traversal over the outback, with an all-encompassing sightseeing tour that incorporates the Royal Flying Doctor Service base and the pioneering School of the Air. The Ayers Rock sojourn entails a vehicular journey to Yulara National Park to scrutinize the cryptic Olgas and Ayers Rock, celebrated for its grottoes and Indigenous petroglyphs, prior to a flight to the effervescent coastal municipality of Cairns. The Great Barrier Reef inclusion affords a diurnal nautical expedition to observe the reef's astonishing biota, encompassing vividly pigmented piscine and other pelagic entities. Sydney's offerings encapsulate the metropolis's thrilling dynamism and scenic grandeur, with a sightseeing tour that grants ingress to the illustrious Opera House and an optional diurnal foray to the Blue Mountains. In Melbourne, attendees may partake in a city sightseeing tour or, as an alternative, witness the Penguin Parade. The denouement of this peregrination is projected to instigate an ardent proclivity for subsequent returns to Australia."

Some people have complained about this year's collection, New Writing 3, although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality, for PS6.99, is pretty amazing?

It's a strange fact that the less well-known people seem to have written mainly about food. Take my advice about Jane Harris' s Those Nails - this piece should definitely not be read just after meals. It contains some very unpleasant scenes which could turn your stomach!
There is fine work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are pieces from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Finally, there is a little non-fiction, which includes a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger on certain newspapers, and an extraordinary piece about herself from Ursula Owen.

This is an exceptional collection and I for one can't wait to see what next year's choice will include.","Although some individuals have voiced complaints about this year's collection, New Writing 3, I fail to comprehend their reasoning. Surely, 500 pages of original writing of such high quality, available for merely £6.99, is quite remarkable. The book is predominantly composed of fiction, encompassing both excerpts from novels and complete short stories. There are some delightful contributions from renowned authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Curiously, the lesser-known writers appear to have focused mainly on themes of food. I would strongly recommend avoiding Jane Harris's piece, Those Nails, immediately after eating, as it contains some very disturbing scenes that could easily nauseate you. The collection also features impressive work from nineteen poets, such as R. S. Thomas and John Burnside, along with segments from ongoing novels by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. To conclude, there is a modest section of non-fiction, including a highly amusing article by Alan Rusbridger critiquing certain newspapers and an extraordinary personal narrative from Ursula Owen. This is an exceptional anthology, and I, for one, am eagerly anticipating what next year's selection will offer.","Despite some criticisms leveled against this year's anthology, New Writing 3, I find the objections unfathomable. The provision of 500 pages of original, high-caliber writing for a mere £6.99 is undeniably impressive. Fiction constitutes the bulk of the volume, featuring both novel excerpts and complete short stories. Among these are enjoyable works by esteemed authors such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. It is a peculiar observation that the less prominent contributors have predominantly centered their narratives around culinary themes. I must caution against perusing Jane Harris's Those Nails postprandially, as it encompasses some profoundly repugnant scenes capable of inducing queasiness. The compilation also showcases refined poetry from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside, as well as fragments from works-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Finally, a minor non-fiction segment encompasses a highly witty article by Alan Rusbridger on specific newspapers and a remarkable introspective piece by Ursula Owen. This collection is truly exceptional, and I personally await with keen interest the contents of next year's edition.","Notwithstanding the grievances some have expressed regarding this year's compilation, New Writing 3, I remain perplexed by their dissent. The acquisition of 500 pages of original, superlative writing for a paltry £6.99 is nothing short of astonishing. Predominantly comprised of fiction, the anthology includes both segments of novels and entire short stories. There are several gratifying contributions from illustrious writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, it is the lesser-known authors who seem to have largely preoccupied themselves with gastronomic subjects. I would emphatically advise eschewing Jane Harris's Those Nails immediately following meals, as it contains some exceedingly distasteful vignettes that could provoke visceral discomfort. Additionally, the collection presents exquisite poetic works from nineteen poets, such as R. S. Thomas and John Burnside, alongside excerpts from nascent novels by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Concluding the volume is a modest non-fiction section, featuring a brilliantly satirical article by Alan Rusbridger on certain periodicals and an extraordinary autobiographical account from Ursula Owen. This is an unparalleled assemblage, and I, for one, am ardently anticipating the revelations of next year's curation."

","Cartoon films possess very few limitations; essentially, anything that can be drawn can be animated on the cinema screen. The incorporation of innovative concepts and sophisticated computer programs has revitalized cartoons, rendering them appealing to individuals of all age groups. By the conclusion of the 1970s, the film industry had concluded that cartoons were exclusively for children. Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, a few directors introduced some highly original ideas, demonstrating that it was feasible to produce films where both adults and children could derive enjoyment. Nonetheless, not every cartoon film achieved success; The Black Cauldron, for example, failed primarily because it was excessively frightening for children and overly juvenile for adults. Directors gleaned insights from this error, leading film companies to once again generate substantial profits.","Cartoon films are subject to remarkably few constraints; virtually any illustration can be brought to life on the cinematic screen. The deployment of novel ideas and cutting-edge computer software has reinvigorated the genre, making cartoons compelling for audiences across all demographics. By the late 1970s, the cinematic establishment had adjudged cartoons to be solely the purview of children. However, in the ensuing period, a handful of directors promulgated highly inventive concepts, substantiating that films could be crafted to engender shared amusement for both adult and juvenile viewers. Notwithstanding, not every animated production met with success; The Black Cauldron, for instance, foundered largely due to its excessive terror for children and its puerility for adults. Directors assimilated lessons from this misstep, precipitating a resurgence in profitability for film corporations.","Cartoon films are characterized by an almost complete absence of limitations; any conceivable drawing can be animated and projected upon the cinema screen. The utilization of groundbreaking ideas and state-of-the-art computer programs has rejuvenated the cartoon medium, rendering it profoundly engaging for spectators of every age cohort. By the terminus of the 1970s, the cinematic milieu had conclusively determined that cartoons were exclusively intended for juvenile audiences. Subsequently, however, a select few directors introduced profoundly original innovations, evincing that it was entirely feasible to produce films in which both mature and young audiences could partake in the delight. Nevertheless, cinematic success was not universal; The Black Cauldron, exempli gratia, foundered principally because it was excessively alarming for children and insufficiently sophisticated for adults. Directors derived invaluable insights from this blunder, thereby enabling film enterprises to amass considerable revenues once more."

Additionally, the centre guarantees that juveniles solely engage in endeavours commensurate with their age and physical proficiencies, necessitating the capacity to swim 25 metres and exhibit robust physical well-being.","The Outdoor Centre constitutes an organisation whose principal objective is the provision of outdoor sport and recreation facilities for the general populace, thereby distinguishing itself from a private club. Fees are predicated on a per-vehicle basis for four occupants, with an incremental surcharge of 50p applicable for each supplementary person, payable at the main office. Organised groups are required to pre-notify the centre regarding their prospective visit. Beginner windsurfing courses are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, contingent upon propitious weather, offering a profoundly enjoyable initiation; the exhilaration experienced during one's inaugural navigation across the aquatic expanse is not readily effaced from memory. Novitiates are provided with boards featuring diminutive sails. The course fee, set at £32.50, is all-inclusive of essential equipment. The one-day adventure course proffers an opportunity long anticipated by many, enabling participants to engage in sailing, climbing, surfing, and archery, designed to introduce adults to outdoor activities in an entertaining and leisurely fashion. Exceptional physical fitness or prior involvement is not a prerequisite; a fundamental interest suffices. This course is available for £22.50. The Play Park, suitable for children aged two to ten, is regarded as one of the most superlative exemplars of its kind nationally, encompassing sand and water play areas, slides, an extensive ball pool, a play castle, and a multitude of additional features. In the ensuing year, the centre will inaugurate a new Play Palace and Play Ship. Group day and residential courses are also extended, attracting recurrent visits from educational institutions and youth groups, with three capacious rooms, each furnished with twelve beds, reservable in advance for assemblies of up to 36 persons (minimum 12). Summer adventure holidays, tailored for individuals aged 8 to 14, incorporate sailing, climbing, windsurfing, and recreational games. Safety is of paramount importance; all staff members are comprehensively trained in First Aid and hold qualifications to instruct the offered activities. Moreover, the centre ensures that children exclusively partake in activities that are appropriate for their age and physical capacities, with mandatory criteria including the ability to swim 25 metres and the maintenance of sound physical health."

The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends.
Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons.
From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music. Margaret says that her method is not supposed to produce great violinists, and always suggests that pupils who perform particularly well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods.

Margaret says that her method is not supposed to produce great violinists, and always suggests that pupils who perform particularly well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods.

","According to Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher based in London, the optimal period for commencing violin instruction is between the ages of three and six, as it coincides with a child's phase of learning about the world. She has a preference for accepting pupils at three and four, though she has frequently made exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds. When she initiated her teaching career in 1972, her inaugural class comprised five-year-old school friends of her children. Margaret's pupils participate in group lessons, with each group consisting of approximately a dozen students and sessions held fortnightly for one hour. In addition, every pupil receives a weekly individual lesson with her. Parental attendance is mandatory, and it is crucial that they maintain an active engagement in the lessons. From the earliest stages, students learn to play by ear and do not attempt to read music until they have been playing for several years, resulting in a considerable disparity between their performance and music reading skills for an extended period. Margaret clarifies that her approach is not designed to produce exceptional violinists, and she consistently recommends that pupils who demonstrate outstanding performance should transition to studying the violin through more conventional methods.","Margaret Porter, a London-based violinist and music educator, asserts that the ideal age to initiate violin studies is between three and six years, aligning with a child's developmental stage of exploring the world. She exhibits a predilection for enrolling pupils at three and four years of age, albeit having granted numerous exceptions for highly motivated five-year-olds. Commencing her pedagogical endeavors in 1972, her initial cohort consisted of five-year-old acquaintances of her offspring. Instruction for Margaret's pupils encompasses group sessions, with each assembly comprising roughly a dozen individuals and conducted on a fortnightly basis for one hour, supplemented by a weekly individual tutorial with her. Parental presence is obligatory, and it is imperative that they cultivate an active involvement in the educational process. Pupils are taught to perform by ear from the outset, deferring music reading until several years into their training, which engenders a pronounced divergence between their instrumental execution and literacy for a considerable duration. Margaret emphasizes that her methodology is not purposed to cultivate virtuosic violinists and invariably proposes that exceptionally proficient students depart to pursue violin instruction via more orthodox approaches.","Margaret Porter, an accomplished violinist and pedagogue residing in London, posits that the quintessential epoch for embarking upon violin acquisition is betwixt three and six years of age, coinciding with the formative period wherein children assimilate knowledge of the world. She manifests a proclivity for instructing novices at three and four years, notwithstanding having acquiesced to myriad exceptions for ardent five-year-olds. Upon inaugurating her tutelage in 1972, her premier class was constituted by quinquennial school companions of her progeny. Margaret's disciples engage in collective didactics, with each coterie encompassing approximately a dozen pupils and convening biweekly for sessions of one hour's duration, concomitantly with a weekly individualized tutorial under her guidance. Parental attendance is mandated, and it is exigent that they evince an actively participatory demeanor in the pedagogical milieu. From the incipient lessons, pupils cultivate the ability to perform aurally, eschewing musical notation until several years of practice have elapsed, thereby precipitating a substantial chasm between their performative prowess and notational comprehension for an extended interval. Margaret elucidates that her instructional paradigm is not architected to engender preeminent violinists, and she perennially counsels that pupils exhibiting superlative aptitude should egress and immerse themselves in violin study through more conventional methodologies."

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually, it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom, as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend the morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers.
One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of those can only attend because they receive government help.
""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like. During the summer holidays my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

To sum up, Atlantic College gives its students an excellent education, using methods which really seem to work.
","Last week, I visited Atlantic College, an outstanding private institution in Wales. Unusually, it offers young people essential life experience beyond the classroom, alongside academic studies for exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and hailing from across the globe, devote their mornings to studying. In the afternoons, they engage in highly beneficial activities, such as assisting on the farm, supporting individuals with learning difficulties, or monitoring rivers for pollution. A notable aspect is the diversity of the student body, with individuals from varied social backgrounds and nations. Since many cannot afford the two-year fees of £20,000, grants are provided. A quarter of the students are British, and numerous ones attend thanks to government assistance. As Barbara Molenkamp, a Dutch student, remarked, 'I truly admire the college for its efforts to foster international understanding among youth. You learn to coexist with and respect people, even those you dislike. During the summer holidays, my mother was astonished by how much less I argued with my sister.' In conclusion, Atlantic College delivers an exceptional education through methods that prove highly effective.","Last week, I undertook a visit to Atlantic College, a distinguished private college situated in Wales. Uniquely, it affords young people indispensable life experience external to the classroom, concurrently providing opportunities for academic examination preparation. The student cohort, comprising individuals aged 16 to 18 from diverse global origins, dedicates their mornings to scholastic pursuits. During the afternoons, they participate in profoundly utilitarian endeavors, including agricultural assistance, care for those with learning difficulties, or environmental monitoring for river pollution. A salient feature is the heterogeneity of the student body, encompassing myriad social backgrounds and nationalities. Given that few can manage the two-year tuition of £20,000, financial grants are accessible. British students constitute a quarter of the population, with many reliant on governmental subsidies for attendance. Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, expressed admiration, stating, 'I profoundly respect the college for its endeavor to promote international comprehension among adolescents. One acquires the ability to cohabit with and esteem others, including those for whom one holds antipathy. Throughout the summer recess, my mother was incredulous at the marked reduction in disputes with my sister.' Ultimately, Atlantic College imparts a superlative education, employing methodologies that demonstrably yield efficacious outcomes.","Last week, I embarked on a visit to Atlantic College, an eminent private institution located in Wales. Distinctively, it proffers young people crucial experiential learning beyond the confines of the classroom, while simultaneously facilitating academic preparation for examinations. The student body, encompassing individuals aged 16 to 18 from a multitude of international locales, allocates their mornings to intensive study. In the afternoons, they engage in substantively beneficial activities, such as contributing to agricultural operations, providing support for individuals with cognitive impairments, or conducting assessments for aquatic pollution in rivers. A paramount characteristic is the demographic diversity, with students emanating from a plethora of socioeconomic strata and nations. As the two-year fees amount to £20,000, rendering them prohibitive for many, stipends are made available. A quarter of the enrollees are British, a significant proportion of whom depend on state-funded assistance to matriculate. Reflecting on this, Barbara Molenkamp, a Dutch student, articulated, 'I hold the college in high esteem for its initiatives to cultivate international amity among the youth. One learns to coexist with and venerate others, even those one finds disagreeable. During the summer interlude, my mother was astounded by the precipitous decline in altercations with my sister.' In summation, Atlantic College delivers an exemplary education through pedagogies that are manifestly efficacious."

Easter quiz for children
During the Easter holidays young visitors can take part in a quiz on the subject ofSurprises.The free quiz sheets can be picked up from the desk at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be directed to 14 surprising paintings and asked a variety of questions about them.
The quiz sheets will be available during normal gallery hours from 25 March until 9 April.

The Gallery now has a fine still life by the Dutch 18th century painter Jan van Os. This large picture (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colours on wood. It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery. The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is not unusual for a picture like this to be dated in two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to bloom in their different seasons in order to paint them. This picture was generously given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.

As one of the premier exemplars of this classification within the Gallery, it is inscribed and annotated with the years 1777 and 1778; such bifold chronology is not anomalous, attributable to the artist's anticipation of specific blossoms attaining anthesis across disparate seasons.

As I gazed down at the river far below, I realized why people are so passionate about rock climbing. My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't particularly impressive, but it provided all the essentials—beds, blankets, and food—and we were delighted to escape the city and breathe the fresh air.

Peering down at the river far beneath me, I comprehended the allure that draws individuals to rock climbing. My companion Matt and I had reached the Activity Centre on Friday evening.

Cameron had been accompanied by two compatriots, Kevin and Simon, while the siblings Carole and Lynn had arrived in the company of Amanda. Hailing from disparate origins, none among us possessed any prior knowledge of the vicinity.

When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run.
I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but also use this as an excuse for not providing separate changing facilities.
I put up posters and 40 women, young and old, fit and unfit, joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river.
At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general.

I resolved to encourage more women to take up the sport, aiming to demonstrate its enjoyment and instill confidence in them to start running. I established a running club for women locally, motivated by my frustration with the stance of many race organizers. They bemoan the scarcity of female participants yet cite this as a justification for failing to offer dedicated changing facilities. I distributed posters, and 40 women, encompassing various ages and fitness levels, enrolled. Initially, they were drawn by the prospect of weight loss, but I doubt they had genuinely contemplated running previously. If they had, they envisioned it as arduous training, not considering the possibility of conversing and smiling while jogging in scenic locations such as alongside a river. Initially, they managed only a minute of running; now, they can sustain thirty minutes. Moreover, they have gained insights from fellow runners regarding diet and overall fitness maintenance. My intention was to contribute to women's running, and I have derived immense satisfaction from observing their advancements, nearly matching their own enjoyment.","Upon injuring my back, I was obliged to interrupt my running pursuits, leading me to resolve to introduce a greater number of women to the sport. My objective was to illustrate its potential for enjoyment and to empower them with the confidence to engage in running. I founded a women's running club in my vicinity, spurred by my exasperation with the prevalent attitude among race organizers. They lament the dearth of female involvement but concurrently employ this as a rationale for abstaining from providing segregated changing amenities. I publicized the club via posters, attracting 40 women of diverse ages and physical conditions. Their primary incentive was weight reduction; however, I surmise they had not earnestly considered running beforehand. When they did entertain the notion, they conjured images of grueling exertion, failing to envisage the camaraderie and delight of running in picturesque settings, such as riverbanks. Initially capable of running merely for a minute, they now achieve thirty-minute sessions. Additionally, they have acquired knowledge from other runners concerning nutritional practices and holistic fitness. Aspiring to advance women's running, I have experienced profound gratification in witnessing their progression, almost paralleling their own sense of accomplishment.","Following a back injury that necessitated a hiatus from my running career, I determined to facilitate the inclusion of more women in the sport, intending to reveal its inherent pleasures and bolster their self-assurance to commence running. I instituted a women's running club within my community, driven by consternation over the disposition of numerous race organizers who bemoan the paucity of female participants yet exploit this as a pretext for eschewing the provision of discrete changing facilities. Through the dissemination of posters, I enlisted 40 women, representing a spectrum of ages and fitness proficiencies. While their initial attraction was predicated on weight loss aspirations, I conjecture they had not previously deliberated seriously about running; when they did, they envisaged it as an ordeal of painful training, oblivious to the prospect of engaging in convivial discourse and exuding joy whilst traversing idyllic locales such as riverine paths. Commencing with mere minute-long runs, they have progressed to sustaining thirty minutes of continuous activity. Furthermore, they have assimilated insights from fellow runners pertaining to dietary regimens and comprehensive fitness preservation. My endeavor was to effectuate a contribution to women's running, and I have derived inordinate pleasure from monitoring their advancements, a sentiment nearly commensurate with their own exhilaration."

What is money? The pound, the dollar or the franc are actually just like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can exchange money for something else. A five pound note may buy a book, a huge bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. But the note itself is only a printed piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, Mr Green the farmer exchanged the com he had grown for Mr Hive's honey. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted. But in time, most societies invented their own 'currencies' so that people could exchange more. The different currencies began to join together, which is why today everyone uses a national currency. 

",B1,"Money is like a gram or a kilometre. You can use money to get things. For example, five pounds can buy a book, sweets, or cinema tickets. But the money note is just paper. It costs very little to make. Long ago, people did not have money. There were no banks or shops. A farmer gave corn to a beekeeper for honey. This was an exchange. Now, most places have their own money. People use money from their country.","Money is similar to a gram or a kilometre. You can exchange money for other items.

The different currencies began to join together, which is why today everyone uses a national currency. 

","Money, such as the pound, dollar, or franc, functions similarly to units like a gram or a kilometre. The key distinction is that money can be exchanged for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note may purchase a book, a large bag of sweets, or a pair of cinema tickets. Nevertheless, the note itself is merely a printed piece of paper with minimal production costs. In ancient times, money as we understand it did not exist; there were no banks or shops. People engaged in barter, such as a farmer trading his corn for a beekeeper's honey, in a direct exchange where each party possessed something the other desired. Eventually, most societies developed their own currencies to facilitate broader exchange. These currencies began to integrate, leading to the widespread use of national currencies today.","Money, exemplified by currencies like the pound, dollar, or franc, operates analogously to standard units such as a gram or a kilometre. The fundamental difference lies in its exchangeability for commodities or services. A five-pound note, for instance, might procure a book, an extensive bag of sweets, or a couple of cinema tickets. However, the note per se is nothing more than an insignificantly costly printed paper artifact. Millennia ago, monetary systems as contemporary societies recognize were absent; banking institutions and retail establishments did not exist. During that era, individuals like a farmer would barter his harvested corn for a beekeeper's honey, constituting a bilateral exchange predicated on mutual need. Over time, the majority of societies devised their own currencies to enable more efficient trade. The convergence of these diverse currencies ultimately resulted in the prevalent adoption of national monetary systems.","Money, encompassing forms such as the pound, dollar, or franc, functions in a manner akin to quantitative measures like a gram or a kilometre, with the pivotal distinction being its capacity for transactional exchange. A five-pound note, for example, may be utilized to acquire a book, a voluminous bag of confectioneries, or a pair of cinema admissions. Yet, the note itself constitutes a mere printed paper entity, incurring negligible production expenses. In antiquity, monetary instruments as conceptualized in modern contexts were non-existent; financial institutions and commercial outlets were absent. During that epoch, agrarian individuals engaged in barter, such as a farmer trading his cultivated corn for apiarist's honey, representing a direct interchange wherein each participant possessed a commodity coveted by the other. Subsequently, most civilizations engineered their own currencies to facilitate expanded commerce. The amalgamation of these disparate monetary units precipitated the contemporary universal reliance on national currencies."

Throughout the preceding eight decades, it has accommodated in excess of 50,000 visitors hailing from 174 distinct nations. The hotel is strategically located on a major thoroughfare leading to the town centre, with a bus journey of roughly 20 minutes; although numerous bus routes terminate outside the premises, patrons must eschew those bearing a blue 'Express' insignia, as they omit stops in the immediate area. An underground station is situated fewer than 100 metres distant.

It is recommended that arrivals via train employ taxi services, given the considerable distance from the primary railway station.","Inaugurated in 1913 under the auspices of Princess Louise, the Sunningdale Hotel has perpetually delivered superlative hospitality to a global and demographically varied patronage. Over the course of the last eighty years, it has played host to more than 50,000 sojourners originating from 174 disparate countries. The establishment is positioned along one of the principal arteries conducing to the urban core, necessitating a bus transit of approximately twenty minutes; whilst a multitude of bus lines disembark adjacent to the hotel, patrons are cautioned to abstain from those emblazoned with a blue 'Express' placard, as they preclude halts in the proximate environs. A subterranean station lies within a hundred metres. The central structure encompasses two hundred exquisitely furnished, centrally-heated single accommodations, each outfitted with basins for hot and cold water, with sanitary installations including showers, baths, and water closets situated at the culmination of all passageways. Facilities comprise a commercial emporium, multiple sitting chambers, four televisual rooms, a table tennis venue, a bibliotheca, and a laundry, augmented by eight pianos at the disposal of guests and parking allocations within the hotel's driveway.

Those partaking in protracted residencies are mandated to disburse for their quarters on a weekly prepayment schedule and must proffer a week's advance notice for egress.

The hotel proscribes all animalia and any manifestations of incendiary activity, and guests are entreated to assiduously mitigate auditory disturbances, particularly during the crepuscular hours from 23:00 to 8:00. It is judicious for train arrivals to engage taxi conveyance, owing to the substantial remoteness from the central railway terminus."

On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book, address book and my purse, which contained about PS50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old, I was a long way from home, and I was quite worried. In fact, I stood by the side of the road and just cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened he said I should keep the fare.
I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would just like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

Upon realising my mistake, I became quite distressed as I am 72 years old and far from home, leading me to cry by the roadside. A compassionate young man inquired about my situation and provided me with money for the bus fare home. The bus driver, upon hearing my story, insisted I keep the fare.

When I became aware of the oversight, I was overcome with anxiety due to my advanced age of 72 and the considerable distance from home, resulting in me weeping at the roadside. A solicitous young man approached me, ascertained the predicament, and generously furnished me with funds for my bus fare. The bus driver, upon learning of the circumstances, advised me to retain the fare. Subsequently, I returned home without incident, and shortly thereafter, the manager of CityBus telephoned to report that my handbag had been secured and proposed to personally deliver it. Upon its return, I found all contents undisturbed, and I wish to convey my deep appreciation for the exceptional benevolence and probity exhibited by all parties involved.","On a Saturday afternoon, I inadvertently left my handbag on the bus, wherein resided my cheque book, address book, and a purse encompassing approximately £50 in currency and an assortment of credit cards. Upon realisation of this lapse, I was seized by considerable distress, exacerbated by my septuagenarian status and the substantial remoteness from my residence, compelling me to weep inconsolably by the wayside. A benevolent young man intervened, inquiring into my plight and munificently providing the requisite sum for my bus fare. The bus driver, apprised of the situation, counseled that I retain the fare. Having returned home unscathed, I was shortly thereafter contacted by the CityBus manager, who announced the retrieval of my handbag and proffered to expedite its return via personal conveyance. The handbag was restored to me with its contents entirely unimpaired, and I wish to articulate my profound gratitude for the extraordinary compassion and unwavering integrity demonstrated by all individuals involved in this incident."

Subsequently, my mother advocated for me to adopt a pastime in lieu of weekend indolence. Initially, I was disinclined, as I preferred remaining at home, but I am profoundly gratified by my decision to enroll.' Their pedagogue, Philippe, asserts, 'The experience is exceedingly pleasurable. Juveniles exhibit superior attentiveness and mnemonic retention compared to adults, albeit the kitchen frequently lacks tidiness during their culinary endeavors. As mature individuals, we perpetually augment our comprehension of gastronomy. Should parents cultivate an affinity for cooking in their children during their formative years, the progeny will be equipped with ample proficiency to fend for themselves culinarily upon emancipation.'","An assembly of juveniles, spanning the ages of ten to fifteen, consecrates their Saturdays to the acquisition of sophisticated culinary techniques. These hebdomadal tutorials, held in diminutive cohorts, are so sought-after that a backlog of thirty candidates awaits enrollment. Guardians disburse £280 for the program, thereby enabling their progeny to engage in merriment whilst refining their competence in the preparation of delectable fare. Bill, a decennary-old enrollee, proclaims, 'I revere my maternal progenitor's culinary endeavors; however, I now surpass her in proficiency. The mentors incite jollity, conspicuously when we assemble to savor the victuals we have fashioned.' Flora, a duodenary-year-old, confronts challenges in the dissection of onions. She expounds, 'I possess an ardent devotion to cookery; I previously executed a banquet for a decury of associates that was met with their unequivocal approbation. Ergo, my mother propounded that I embrace an avocation to supplant weekend torpor. Initially, I was apathetic, given my predilection for domestic repose, yet I am immensely content with my resolution to participate.' Their preceptor, Philippe, avers, 'The undertaking is profoundly diverting. Offspring demonstrate heightened concentration and mnemonic acuity relative to adults, notwithstanding that the culinary environment often devolves into disarray during their exertions. As mature beings, we incessantly augment our erudition regarding alimentation. Provided that parents inculcate a penchant for cookery in their children during their nascent stages, the latter will be endowed with sufficient dexterity to autonomously provision themselves upon attaining independence.'"

Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role

'I never expected to spend some of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I'd only ever acted at school, but I'd loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan and I always imagined myself playing her.
I'd taken a year off to go travelling before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me to say there were plans to turn the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to go for the part. She was surprised at first, but sent my photograph to the director and persuaded him to meet me. I flew back and got the part.
The outdoor filming started a week into term, so I got permission from the university to be away for three weeks. Once I was back at university, I got up at 6.00am to write the essays I'd missed. I didn't tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great.
It was an amazing experience I'm so lucky. After university, I definitely want to make acting my career. I'm not from an acting family, though my grandfather was an opera singer. I've tried for other TV parts but haven't received any offers yet.
I don't know how I managed it all, because I had a full social life too. When filming finished, I hardly knew what to do. I've since appeared in two college plays.

Having only previously acted in school, she had adored the book since age eleven, with her grandmother remarking on her resemblance to Polly Finnegan, fueling her aspiration to portray the character. After a gap year spent travelling, notably in Chile, her mother informed her via email of plans to adapt the book into a TV drama, prompting Caroline to pursue the part. Initially taken aback, her mother facilitated a meeting with the director by submitting her photograph, leading to Caroline's successful audition upon her return. Filming commenced a week into the academic term, necessitating university approval for a three-week absence. Upon resuming studies, she rose at 6:00 am to complete missed essays. Although she kept it private, her university friends discovered her involvement and were enthusiastic. She deems the experience extraordinary and feels fortunate, with ambitions to pursue acting professionally post-university. Despite no familial acting background, her grandfather was an opera singer. She has auditioned for other television roles but has yet to receive offers. Balancing a vibrant social life, she reflects on how she managed it all and felt disoriented after filming concluded. Subsequently, she has performed in two college plays and has visited home infrequently; now that her first year is over, she is departing for Greece with friends for the summer.","Caroline Benson reflects on her debut television role, recounting the unexpected opportunity to film The Finnegans during her inaugural year at university. With prior acting experience limited to school productions, she had cherished the novel since the age of eleven, and her grandmother's observation that she embodied Polly Finnegan's character inspired her long-held desire to assume the role. Following a pre-university gap year devoted to travel, which included a stint in Chile, her mother notified her via email of the book's adaptation into a television drama, compelling Caroline to audition. Her mother, though initially surprised, advocated for her by forwarding her photograph to the director and securing an interview, culminating in Caroline securing the part upon her return. Principal outdoor filming initiated a week into the academic term, requiring official university consent for a three-week leave of absence. Upon her return to academic duties, she commenced her days at 6:00 am to compensate for missed essays. While she had intended to maintain discretion, her university peers uncovered her involvement and responded with admiration. She regards the experience as profoundly rewarding and considers herself fortunate, with a definitive intention to embark on an acting career after graduation. Although not from an acting lineage, her grandfather was an opera singer. She has pursued additional television roles but has not yet garnered any offers. She contemplates the challenge of juggling a full social calendar alongside her commitments and experienced a sense of disorientation post-filming. Since then, she has featured in two collegiate theatrical productions and has had limited visits home; with her first academic year concluded, she is en route to Greece for the summer with companions.","Caroline Benson elaborates on her inaugural television performance, expressing astonishment at engaging in the filming of The Finnegans during her nascent university year. Her acting background was confined to scholastic endeavors, yet she had held a profound affinity for the literary work since she was eleven, with her grandmother frequently drawing parallels between her and Polly Finnegan, thereby cementing her aspiration to personify the character. Subsequent to a pre-tertiary gap year dedicated to peregrination, including sojourns in Chile, her mother apprised her via electronic correspondence of the novel's impending transformation into a televised drama, instigating Caroline's resolute pursuit of the role. Her mother, albeit initially taken aback, expedited the process by disseminating her photograph to the director and persuading him to convene an audition, which culminated in Caroline's successful acquisition of the part upon her repatriation. Exterior filming commenced a week subsequent to the term's inception, mandating formal university authorization for a three-week hiatus. Upon reintegrating into academic life, she initiated her diurnal routine at 6:00 am to redress the deficit in essay composition. Despite her intent for confidentiality, her collegiate associates ascertained her involvement and extolled its merits. She characterizes the ordeal as an exceptional venture for which she deems herself propitious, with an unequivocal ambition to professionalize acting post-graduation. Notwithstanding the absence of a theatrical pedigree, her grandfather was a distinguished opera vocalist. She has contended for supplementary television roles but has thus far failed to secure any engagements. She ruminates on the exigencies of harmonizing a bustling social itinerary with her obligations and encountered a period of adjustment following the filming's cessation. In the interim, she has graced two university stage productions and has been largely absentee from her familial abode; now that her inaugural academic annum has concluded, she is embarking on a summer excursion to Greece with her associates."

Grass is probably the most successful living plant in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. 
Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. 
Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

","Grass is arguably the most successful plant globally, with over 9,000 species inhabiting every region, including the frigid Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands sustain a diverse array of fauna, from insects and birds to large mammals such as cows and lions, all of which rely on grass in various ways.

Grasslands foster an extensive spectrum of animal life, ranging from minute insects and avian species to colossal mammals like bovines and felines, all of which exhibit dependence on grass in some capacity. Grass demonstrates remarkable resilience, regenerating swiftly post-damage; its new foliage sprouts from beneath the soil rather than the apex, a unique trait that perpetuates a reliable food source, thereby enabling substantial animal communities to coexist in localized areas.","Grass is arguably the preeminent plant in terms of global success, encompassing over 9,000 species and proliferating across all regions, including the inhospitable, frozen expanses of the Arctic and Antarctic.

Welcome to the website. Here is all you need to know before booking a flight.
During the brief Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a full- size passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over the continent of Antarctica and back.
Flight dates for next year are not definite yet, but if you make a booking now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the day.
Questions
These are answers to the most frequently asked questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.
How long is the flight?
The average flight is 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, Antarctica experts who have lived on scientific research stations there give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera next to the pilot, which is linked to the video system on board, gives you a pilot's eye view throughout, from take-off to landing.
Will I get a seat next to a window?
All passengers are given two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, passengers are asked to move to the seat shown on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a next-to-window seat for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or the seat next to a window seat for half of the flight and an end of row seat for the other half of the flight. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up from their seats and move about the plane, allowing everyone to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow these amazing sights to be seen equally well from both sides of the plane.
What happens if the weather is bad?
We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain looks at the satellite cloud picture on the morning of the flight and selects the direction which promises the clearest views.
Will I see penguins and other wildlife?
As most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 metres below the plane, we can't see them in any detail. We do not land on Antarctica, primarily for environmental reasons. To experience Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.
Can I take photographs?

In 1988, Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won,' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.'
The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, learnt about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realised immediately that she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I had no idea what he meant. The only sport I knew about was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me training. It was such hard work and my legs really ached.' But Jose visited her parents and persuaded them she could be successful and this would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her away to train.
In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was unlike those of the girls she met in the US.

He successfully entreated her parents by contending that her potential success could ameliorate their pecuniary hardships, thereby obtaining their consent for her departure. In 1991, she eventually accepted a solicitation to train in the United States, having previously demurred due to profound familial attachments. There, she discerned a stark dichotomy between her own background, fraught with concerns over parental sustenance, and that of her American counterparts, who were engrossed in sartorial and cosmetic matters. Notwithstanding their scant insight into her predicaments, she esteemed the opportunity to benefit from the trainers' erudition, accruing considerable knowledge. To this day, Maria continues her athletic pursuits and resides predominantly in South Africa, leading a felicitous existence with her mother."

","Honey is a sweet liquid created by bees, composed of water and various sugars. Bees may journey as far as seventy-five thousand kilometers and pollinate over two million flowers to produce merely half a kilogram of honey. The color and flavor of honey are influenced by the specific flowers visited, with more than three hundred distinct varieties existing. Generally, lighter-colored honeys possess a milder taste compared to their darker counterparts. Historically, honey served as the principal sweetening agent in ancient societies, as sugar was exceedingly scarce; for instance, the ancient Egyptians held honey in high esteem and utilized it as a medium of exchange. In contemporary times, honey is globally produced and consumed. Studies suggest that it aids in reducing fatigue and boosting athletic performance. Moreover, honey extends beyond culinary uses; it is employed to alleviate sore throats and is incorporated into numerous skin and hair-care formulations.","Honey is a viscous, sweet substance synthesized by bees, consisting predominantly of water and assorted sugars. To yield a mere half kilogram of honey, bees might traverse distances up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and forage from in excess of two million blossoms. The chromatic and gustatory properties of honey are contingent upon the botanical sources from which it is derived, with over three hundred distinct varieties cataloged. Typically, honeys of a lighter hue exhibit a more subdued flavor profile relative to their darker analogues. In antiquity, honey constituted the primary saccharine foodstuff, given the rarity of sugar; it was particularly esteemed by the ancient Egyptians, who deployed it as a form of remuneration. Presently, honey is ubiquitously produced and ingested across the globe. Empirical research posits that honey mitigates fatigue and augments athletic prowess. Furthermore, honey transcends its role as a comestible; it is administered for the palliation of sore throats and is integrated into a plethora of dermatological and capillary care commodities.","Honey, a saccharine fluid elaborated by apian species, is an amalgam of aqueous and saccharide constituents. Apis mellifera may embark on foraging expeditions spanning as much as seventy-five thousand kilometers, visiting in excess of two million floral specimens to synthesize a mere five hundred grams of this ambrosial substance. The organoleptic characteristics of honey, including its chromatic intensity and flavor nuances, are dictated by the specific anthophilous sources, with a panoply of over three hundred varietals extant. Invariably, lighter-hued honeys proffer a more delicate gustatory experience vis-à-vis their darker counterparts. In ancient epochs, honey reigned as the preeminent sweetening agent, owing to the paucity of sucrose; it was held in profound regard by the ancient Egyptians, who employed it as a numismatic instrument. In the contemporary milieu, honey is produced and consumed on a global scale. Scholarly investigations intimate that honey possesses ergogenic properties, attenuating lassitude and enhancing physical performance. Beyond its alimentary applications, honey is utilized as a demulcent for pharyngeal irritations and is a constituent in a myriad of cosmeceutical and trichological formulations."
88,"Climbing to the top of Britain

Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland, and because of its northerly location, the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis.

It was February, my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred metres up - probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up.
We were carrying tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots -you'd have trouble on Ben Nevis without them because you get snow so hard it's like walking on ice.

Although the weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when we set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.
The track soon climbed and my legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, I had to rest more frequently. The others sometimes stopped for a break to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them they set off again. I promised myself that in future I would always train properly before a climb.
After 200 metre<;,we reached the beginning of Tower Ridge, the route that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It's only a metre and a half wide and the mountain drops away hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to keep calm and concentrate on every step as we moved slowly along it.
After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. However, we weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down.
On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly a wrong turn could lead to slopes too dangerous to go down in winter.

Climber Keith Hewitt recounts his inaugural winter expedition on Ben Nevis. It occurred in February, marking his first significant winter climb. Their route ascended the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge, a 600-meter climb that is likely the longest in Britain. They intended to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which resemble large bowls carved into the mountain's walls midway up. They transported tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for their boots, as the snow on Ben Nevis becomes so hard it resembles ice, making these spikes essential. Despite some group members being highly experienced, they packed various safety equipment, including lights for signaling, hard hats, and additional clothing. Although the weather forecast was ideal with no strong winds, a sense of apprehension persisted when they commenced. Ben Nevis in winter invariably presents a challenge. The path soon steepened, and Keith's legs felt burdensome. As the least fit member, he required more frequent rests. The others occasionally paused to allow him to catch up, but they resumed promptly upon his arrival. He resolved to always train adequately before future climbs. After 200 meters, they reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path leading to the summit. It is merely 1.5 meters wide with sheer drops of hundreds of meters on either side, necessitating calm and intense concentration with each step. After seven hours of climbing, they attained the summit. On a clear day, one can observe the sea and across to the Isle of Skye, 48 kilometers distant; however, they were unfortunate as mist had descended. On Ben Nevis, the descent to camp can be equally challenging as the ascent. Proper map reading is crucial, as an incorrect turn could lead to slopes too perilous to navigate in winter. Keith was relieved they had opted to rotate the responsibility of map reading. Initially, it was only upon being secure in the tent that he could genuinely say he relished the experience, but at least he succeeded in reaching the top.","Each year, thousands of people undertake the ascent of Ben Nevis in Scotland, and owing to its northerly latitude, the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt provides an account of his first winter climb on Ben Nevis. It was in February, representing his inaugural major winter ascent. Their chosen route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge, a 600-meter climb that is probably the longest in Britain. They had arranged to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are akin to large bowls etched into the mountain's walls at mid-height. They were laden with tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for their boots, as the snow on Ben Nevis becomes so compacted it is analogous to walking on ice, rendering such equipment indispensable. Even though some members of the group were highly experienced, they equipped themselves with an array of safety gear, including lights for attracting attention, hard hats, and supplementary clothing. Although the meteorological forecast was flawless, devoid of strong winds, a pervasive sense of trepidation accompanied their departure, as Ben Nevis in winter perpetually constitutes a formidable challenge. The trail soon ascended, and Keith's legs felt ponderous. Being the least robust participant, he necessitated more frequent intervals of rest. His companions intermittently halted to permit him to catch up, but they promptly resumed progress upon his arrival. He vowed to himself that in the future, he would invariably engage in thorough training prior to a climb. After 200 meters, they attained the commencement of Tower Ridge, the pathway that would convey them to the apex of Ben Nevis. It is a mere 1.5 meters in width, with the mountain plunging hundreds of meters on either side, obliging them to maintain composure and concentrate meticulously on each step as they advanced gradually along it. Subsequent to seven hours of climbing, they reached the summit. On a lucid day, one can discern the sea and across it to the Isle of Skye, 48 kilometers away; however, they were not so fortunate, as a mist had enveloped the area. On Ben Nevis, the return descent to camp can be as arduous as the ascent. Competent map reading is imperative, as an erroneous turn could result in slopes that are too hazardous to descend in winter conditions. Keith was gratified that they had elected to alternate the task of navigation. That initial occasion, it was only when he was securely within the tent that he could affirm he truly savored the experience, but at the very least, he accomplished the summit.","Annually, multitudes ascend Ben Nevis in Scotland, and given its northerly situation, the climate can be excruciatingly frigid. Climber Keith Hewitt delineates his inaugural winter ascent of Ben Nevis. It transpired in February, constituting his first substantial winter climb. Their itinerary involved scaling the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge, a 600-meter ascent that is presumably the most protracted in Britain. They had schemed to bivouac for three days in the 'Carries', which are analogous to vast bowls incised into the mountain's flanks at mid-altitude. They were burdened with tents, sleeping bags, and crampons for their boots, as the snow on Ben Nevis becomes so indurated it is tantamount to traversing ice, making such implements imperative. Notwithstanding that some cohort members were exceedingly seasoned, they provisioned themselves with a panoply of safety apparatus, encompassing lights for signaling, helmets, and ancillary attire. Albeit the weather prognosis was impeccable, with no robust winds, an omnipresent aura of apprehension pervaded their outset, for Ben Nevis in winter invariably presents a daunting ordeal. The track promptly inclined, and Keith's legs felt encumbered. As the most feeble constituent, he required more recurrent respites. His associates sporadically desisted to enable him to regain proximity, but they forthwith recommended upon his advent. He pledged to himself that henceforth he would invariably undergo rigorous preparation antecedent to a climb. After 200 meters, they reached the inception of Tower Ridge, the conduit that would transport them to the zenith of Ben Nevis. It is a scant 1.5 meters broad, with the mountain plummeting hundreds of meters on each flank, compelling them to preserve equanimity and focus intensely on every footfall as they progressed sedately along it. Following seven hours of climbing, they attained the summit. On an unclouded day, one can espy the sea and beyond it to the Isle of Skye, 48 kilometers distant; however, they were less fortunate, as a mist had descended. On Ben Nevis, the retrograde descent to camp can be as formidable as the ascent. Proficient cartographical interpretation is essential, as an injudicious deviation could culminate in slopes too perilous to negotiate in winter. Keith was content that they had resolved to rotate the duty of navigation. On that initial foray, it was solely when he was ensconced securely in the tent that he could profess to having genuinely relished the experience, but at a minimum, he succeeded in reaching the apex."

Kath mentions that people often laugh upon hearing this, yet it is factual; Gareth developed this desire after attending the circus at three years old. When Alan became unemployed, he and Kath sought full-time positions in the circus, successfully securing roles in a renowned one, where Gareth commenced his clown training under the name Bippo. They accompany the circus during the summer months and return home for winter, with his brothers managing the house in their absence.

They peregrinate with the circus during the aestival months and revert to their domicile for the hibernal period, with his brothers, by virtue of their maturity, assuming custodianship of the residence. Kath avows that the undertaking was formidable, necessitating meticulous orchestration, and involved forsaking their agreeable abode for a solitary vehicle and an exiguous caravan, with Gareth particularly bemoaning the deprivation of his prolonged thermal ablutions. Pertaining to his pedagogical regimen, Gareth elucidates that didactic provision is invariably instituted at each locale, enabling him to pursue the standardized curricular materials complemented by computational resources, thus ensuring he remains commensurate with his academic cohort. In prospective considerations, Kath acknowledges the decision's arduous nature but affirms its indispensability for Gareth's clowning indoctrination, expressing gratification at its operational success and their derived pleasure. Gareth harbors ambitions of ultimately attaining the preeminent clown position in a circus, potentially inaugurating his own establishment under the appellation Bippo's Circus."
90,"The History of Shoes 

In the past, importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins, which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on what is in fashion. 
It was only one hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers. 

",B1,"Shoes have a long history. Long ago, shoes were not comfortable or stylish. People used animal skins to cover their feet in cold weather. Today, we use leather, silk, plastic, and cotton for shoes. About 150 years ago, people started wearing different shoes for the left and right feet. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes were made by hand in the past. Now, most shoes are made by machines in big factories. This makes many cheap shoes for more people.","The history of shoes shows that in the past, comfort and fashion were not important.

The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers. 

","Historically, shoes were not prioritized for comfort or fashion. Early footwear probably consisted of animal skins that individuals secured around their ankles during cold conditions. Leather remains in use today, yet materials such as silk, plastic, and cotton are also prevalent, influenced by contemporary fashion. It was merely 150 years ago that distinct shoes for the left and right feet became common; before that, shoes were straight and interchangeable between feet. All shoes were originally crafted by hand, but currently, while some artisans employ traditional techniques, the majority are manufactured by machines in extensive factories. The advent of sewing machines enabled the shoe industry to mass-produce affordable shoes, catering to a wider consumer base.","In the annals of footwear history, comfort and aesthetic appeal were not initially emphasized. Primitive foot coverings likely comprised animal hides, which were fastened around the ankles to mitigate cold weather. Contemporary shoe production continues to utilize leather, alongside other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton, with popularity dictated by prevailing fashion trends. The practice of wearing differentiated shoes for each foot emerged only 150 years ago; prior to that, footwear was symmetrical and could be worn on either foot. Historically, all shoes were meticulously handmade, but in the modern era, despite the persistence of artisans employing traditional craftsmanship, the bulk of shoes are fabricated by machinery in large-scale industrial plants. The integration of sewing machines facilitated the shoe industry's capacity to generate substantial quantities of economical footwear, thereby expanding accessibility to a more diverse clientele.","Throughout the evolution of footwear, considerations of comfort and sartorial elegance were not paramount in earlier epochs. Antecedent foot coverings presumably consisted of animal pelts, which individuals would affix around their ankles as a bulwark against inclement conditions. In contemporary times, leather persists as a material of choice, although substances such as silk, plastic, and cotton are equally ubiquitous, their adoption contingent upon cyclical fashion dictates. The convention of donning distinct shoes for the left and right feet materialized a mere 150 years ago; hitherto, footwear exhibited a rectilinear design, rendering it ambidextrous. All shoes were formerly fashioned by manual labor, yet in the present day, notwithstanding the continued existence of cobblers who hone traditional skills, the preponderance of shoes is manufactured via mechanized processes in expansive industrial complexes. The deployment of sewing machines precipitated the shoe industry's ability to produce copious volumes of cost-effective footwear, thereby democratizing access for an extensive spectrum of consumers."
91,"Free-diving in the Caribbean

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, the sport in which competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air.
In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath, and come back up to the top without help. She had been deeper a year before but on that occasion she swam back up using a balloon. This time, however, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man. A team of fourteen safety divers at different depths watched the dive.
Following reports of several serious accidents involving other divers, some people have complained that free-diving is too dangerous a sport, but Tanya doesn't agree, insisting that safety is the most important thing, followed closely by training.
Most free-divers concentrate on one or two types of event within the sport, but whatever Tanya is in training for, her practice timetable remains the same. Two thirds of the programme is spent doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart. However, she doesn't run, whether outdoors or on running machines, because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness. When she starts doing practice dives, she generally travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over a four-week period, with a rest day between each diving day. It is essential that she doesn't get tired because that could ruin all the preparation.
When Tanya is not preparing for an event, she makes frequent public appearances, mainly to advertise sports products. She has also supported environmental organisations, for example doing research projects or making films. Spending her childhood on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she went swimming whenever she could, and long afternoons were spent exploring rockpoolsinordertowatchthesealife.Tanyasaysthatherlifetodayislikelivingherchildhood dreams.

As she didn't take up free-diving until she was twenty-five, Tanya is keen to stress that she doesn't intend to retire from the sport for many years to come.","Tanya Streeter possesses four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors achieve remarkable depths on a single breath. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and resurface unaided, having held her breath for over three and a half minutes. This accomplishment rendered her the sole female in any sport to surpass a male world record. A team of fourteen safety divers observed the dive at various depths. Despite reports of serious accidents among other divers leading some to criticize free-diving as excessively perilous, Tanya contends that safety is paramount, closely followed by rigorous training. Her training regimen is consistent regardless of the event, with two-thirds dedicated to land-based gym workouts and the remainder split between pool and ocean sessions. She employs an exercise bike to enhance cardiovascular fitness but eschews running to safeguard her knees, preferring brisk walking as an effective alternative. During practice dives, she typically relocates from home, aiming for fourteen dives over a four-week span with intermittent rest days to prevent exhaustion. Off-season, she frequently engages in public appearances to endorse sports products and collaborates with environmental organizations on projects like research and filmmaking. Having spent her childhood on Grand Cayman immersed in swimming and marine exploration, she regards her present life as the realization of her youthful aspirations. Her renown enables her to advocate for environmental causes effectively. Looking ahead, Tanya, now in her thirties, intends to continue shattering her own records and has no imminent plans to retire from the sport.","Tanya Streeter holds four world records in the discipline of free-diving, wherein participants attain extraordinary depths relying solely on a single inhalation. In 2003, she etched her name in history by accomplishing a 120-meter descent into the ocean and an unaided ascent, sustaining her breath for in excess of three and a half minutes. This feat distinguished her as the inaugural female to eclipse a male world record across any sporting domain. The endeavor was scrutinized by a contingent of fourteen safety divers stationed at disparate depths. Notwithstanding accounts of grave incidents involving other practitioners that have prompted censure of free-diving as unduly hazardous, Tanya refutes such assertions, underscoring that safety is of utmost importance, with training a close secondary. Irrespective of her specific training objectives, her schedule remains invariant: two-thirds are allocated to terrestrial exercises at the gym, and the residual portion is apportioned between aquatic environments. She utilizes an exercise bicycle to augment cardiac fitness but abstains from running to mitigate knee trauma, deeming rapid ambulation a superior modality for conditioning. When undertaking practice dives, she generally journeys afar, targeting fourteen submersions over a tetrad of weeks interspersed with repose days to avert enervation. During interims from competition preparation, she routinely partakes in public engagements, predominantly to market athletic merchandise, and allies with ecological entities through initiatives such as investigative projects and cinematography. Her formative years on Grand Cayman were characterized by frequent aquatic excursions and protracted investigations of rock pools to observe marine biota, and she perceives her contemporary existence as the actualization of juvenile fantasies. Leveraging her celebrity in certain nations, she finds audiences receptive to her environmental advocacy. Pertaining to her trajectory, Tanya, currently in her fourth decade, articulates designs to perpetually surpass her own benchmarks and, having commenced free-diving at twenty-five, is resolute in prolonging her career indefinitely.","Tanya Streeter is the holder of four world records in free-diving, an athletic pursuit characterized by competitors achieving prodigious depths on merely one respiration. In 2003, she secured a historic milestone by becoming the premier individual to execute a 120-meter plunge into the oceanic abyss and return to the surface autonomously, all while apneic for a duration exceeding three and a half minutes. This endeavor not only surpassed her prior depth attainment—which had involved auxiliary ascent via a balloon—but also rendered her the singular female across all sports to have broken a male world record. A cadre of fourteen safety divers, positioned at stratified depths, surveilled the undertaking. In the wake of reports detailing several severe mishaps among fellow divers, which have incited contentions that free-diving is an excessively perilous sport, Tanya demurs, insisting that safety constitutes the paramount concern, with training assuming a proximate significance. Her training protocol remains invariant regardless of the specific event for which she is preparing; it entails a bifurcation wherein two-thirds is devoted to land-based conditioning at a gymnasium, and the remainder is partitioned between pool and oceanic venues. She employs a stationary bicycle to ameliorate cardiovascular efficacy but forgoes running in any form to preclude knee injuries, instead finding that brisk perambulation serves as an efficacious means of fitness augmentation. When initiating practice dives, she customarily decamps from her domicile, aspiring to complete fourteen immersions over a quadripartite weekly interval, with intercalated days of respite to forestall fatigue that could vitiate preparatory efforts. During periods devoid of event preparation, she frequently partakes in public appearances, chiefly to promulgate sports merchandise, and has bolstered environmental organizations through endeavors such as research initiatives and film production. Her juvenility on the Caribbean isle of Grand Cayman was marked by incessant swimming and protracted diurnal explorations of rock pools to scrutinize marine fauna, and she avers that her contemporary existence epitomizes the fruition of her puerile aspirations. Owing to her renown in select countries, she discerns that individuals are predisposed to heed her discourse on ecological matters. As for her prospective endeavors, Tanya, now in her fourth decade, declares her intention to persistently eclipse her own world records and, having embarked upon free-diving at the age of twenty-five, is ardent in emphasizing that she envisages no retirement from the sport for the foreseeable future."

Their preceptor, Philippe, comments, 'The endeavor is exceedingly diverting. Juveniles demonstrate heightened attentiveness and superior mnemonic retention compared to adults, albeit the kitchen environment often succumbs to disarray during their gastronomic endeavors.

","San Francisco is situated on the northern California coast. The initial European discovery of the area was made by a Spanish explorer, Gaspar de Portola, who first observed it in 1769. Remarkably, despite San Francisco Bay being an excellent natural harbor, it was discovered overland rather than by sea. In 1849, thousands of individuals flocked to San Francisco with hopes of striking gold.

During the 1849 Gold Rush, multitudes descended upon San Francisco aspiring to uncover gold, yet it was not the fortune seekers who attained prosperity. The wealthiest individuals accrued their fortunes through the ownership of banks and law firms, erecting grandiose dwellings upon Nob Hill.

Paradoxically, despite San Francisco Bay's exceptional qualities as a natural harbor, it was identified through terrestrial means rather than naval endeavor. The 1849 influx of thousands, driven by gold fever, saw prospectors largely unsuccessful in amassing wealth; instead, affluence was secured by those controlling financial and legal institutions, who constructed opulent residences on the prominence known as Nob Hill. In the modern era, San Francisco entices visitors to its famed locales such as Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge, with numerous tourists embarking on a brief maritime excursion to Alcatraz Island to explore the erstwhile correctional facility."

95,"Rock Band

Two years ago,our 14-year-old s on,Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first,we were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued ,'and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.'
That was just the beginning. Because drums are not the easiest instrument to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. And so, for several hours a week,the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.
At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band start practising, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenage - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people.
Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet. I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.",B1,"Two years ago, our son Ben was 14.

We said, 'You must think about the family and neighbors when you play.' Then, Ben's friends in the band came to our house with guitars and other things. Now, the house is noisy for hours each week. When the band plays, my husband and I go for a walk. The boys are nice. I do not know if their music is good, but they play in clubs for young people. We worry that Ben will not study enough, but he is good now. Ben was right: he is not in trouble and not bored.","Two years ago, our 14-year-old son Ben wanted drums for his birthday.

I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.","Two years ago, our son Ben, who was 14 at the time, requested a drum set for his birthday. Initially, we were strongly opposed to the idea due to the potential noise. Ben contended that it was a preferable alternative to watching television or playing computer games in his leisure time, and it would help him avoid trouble. Eventually, we relented, stipulating that he must be mindful of the rest of the family and the neighbors when playing. This marked just the beginning. As drums are not easily transportable, the other members of Ben's band started gathering at our home with their guitars and additional electrical gear. Consequently, for several hours each week, the house reverberates with the noise from their instruments and their adolescent singing. At least Ben's hobby has benefited our health; whenever the band commences practice, my husband and I embark on a long walk. I must acknowledge that, although their music may seem somewhat unusual, they are a cordial and respectful group of youths. I cannot assess their musical proficiency—after all, I never anticipated that my parents' generation would appreciate the same music I did as a teenager—but they do perform regularly in local clubs catering to young people. Our primary concern is that their musical pursuits might detract from their academic responsibilities, though this has not occurred yet. I continually emphasize to Ben the significance of his studies. Nonetheless, one thing is definite: Ben was correct in asserting that it has kept him out of trouble and prevented boredom.","Two years ago, our then 14-year-old son Ben petitioned for a drum set as a birthday gift. We were initially vehemently opposed to the notion, primarily due to concerns over noise pollution. Ben argued that engaging in drumming was a more constructive use of his free time than indulging in television or computer games, and it would serve to keep him out of mischief. Ultimately, we acquiesced, on the condition that he remain considerate of the family and neighbors during his practice sessions. This concession merely heralded the onset of further developments. Given the impracticality of transporting drums, the other members of Ben's band commenced assembling at our residence, bringing along their guitars and assorted electronic apparatus. As a result, for several hours weekly, our domicile is subjected to the cacophony of their instrumental performances and youthful vocalizations. On a positive note, Ben's pastime has inadvertently promoted our well-being; each time the band initiates a rehearsal, my husband and I undertake an extended walk. I must concede that, albeit their musical style may strike one as eccentric, they comport themselves as amiable and courteous young men. I am in no position to evaluate their artistic talent—indeed, I never presumed that my parents' cohort would have an affinity for the music I favored during my adolescence—yet they consistently perform at local venues for youth. Our predominant apprehension is that their musical endeavors might encroach upon their scholastic commitments, although this has not materialized to date. I perpetually underscore to Ben the paramount importance of his academic pursuits. However, one certainty remains: Ben's assertion was accurate, as it has effectively deterred him from trouble and averted ennui.","Two years prior, our son Ben, then aged 14, solicited a drum kit for his birthday. We were initially resolutely opposed to the proposition, chiefly owing to the anticipated auditory disturbances. Ben contended that percussive practice constituted a more edifying diversion than passive television viewing or digital gaming during his leisure hours, and it would function as a deterrent to misconduct. In due course, we capitulated, stipulating that he must exercise consideration for the household and adjacent residents whilst playing. This acquiescence merely presaged subsequent developments. Owing to the logistical challenges associated with transporting percussion instruments, the ancillary members of Ben's ensemble began convening at our abode, equipped with their guitars and an array of electronic paraphernalia. Consequently, for several hours per week, the residence is permeated by the reverberations of their instrumental exertions and pubescent vocal renditions. Fortuitously, Ben's avocation has conferred salubrious benefits upon us; upon the commencement of band rehearsals, my spouse and I invariably embark upon a protracted perambulation. I must avow that, although their musical compositions might be perceived as somewhat unorthodox, they are an affable and decorous coterie of adolescents. I am ill-equipped to adjudicate their musical prowess—after all, I never harbored the expectation that my parental generation would espouse the same musical predilections I cherished in my youth—nonetheless, they perform with regularity at local establishments catering to a juvenile demographic. Our principal trepidation pertains to the potential for their artistic pursuits to impinge upon their academic obligations, though this has not yet transpired. I incessantly inculcate in Ben the criticality of his scholarly endeavors. Notwithstanding, one verity is incontrovertible: Ben's prognostication was veracious, as it has efficaciously precluded him from transgression and averted any state of tedium."

This institution, erstwhile a palatial residence, now harbors a superlative collection of pictorial art, tapestries, and sculptural works. You will then repatriate to the ship and navigate to Tua.
Day 5: Herein, the Douro undergoes considerable constriction. Subject to the river's profundity, progression may be effected by a more diminutive watercraft to the Hispanic demarcation at Barca d'Alva. The retrograde journey to Tua is undertaken by motorcoach, replete with copious scenic attractions en route.
Day 6: During the forenoon, you will chauffeur to Sao Joao da Pesqueira to apprehend one of the most sublime prospects in the entire Douro valley. Post-luncheon on the ship, you will ingress the Douro river valley railway for an idyllic perambulation through the bucolic environs to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be berthed.
Day 7: An expedition to Vila Real will antecede your return to the ship for the midday meal, after which you will initiate the downstream voyage to Oporto, with an overnight sojourn aboard.
Day 8: You will make landfall in Oporto with sufficient temporal allocation for independent peregrination and ultimate acquisitive activities prior to your aeronautical repatriation to London Heathrow."
98,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA,
Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. This town grew so quickly during 1909 that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the summer months, essential supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat, but in the winter the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to them. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners.
The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat for both themselves and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.
However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but, unfortunately, the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot considered skilled enough to manage the flight, was away on a trip at the time. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead.
The trip covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska looking for gold, travelled the first 400 of those kilometres. He had to trust his dog Togo's ability to find his way in the blinding snow and Togo turned out to be a reliable guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point Balto refused to go any further, and saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped and Balto became a hero.
Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.",B1,"In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska. Many people went there. They built new towns. One town was Iditarod. It grew fast. In winter, boats could not go because of ice. So, in 1910, people used dogs with sleds. The dogs took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was the Iditarod Trail. Dogs took three weeks to go across Alaska. They stopped at houses for rest. In the 1920s, planes replaced the dogs. In 1925, a sickness hit Nome. Medicine was in Anchorage. Dogs took the medicine on the Iditarod Trail. It took six days. Many dogs helped. Balto was a hero dog. Now, there is a dog sled race every year from Anchorage to Nome. It is called the Iditarod.","In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, and many people moved there to get rich. New towns grew quickly, including Iditarod, which means 'far place'. In 1909, it became the biggest city in Alaska for a short time. In summer, supplies came by boat, but in winter, the water froze, so in 1910, a winter trail was made for dog sleds. The dogs carried mail, food, and clothes to miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail, and it took about three weeks to cross Alaska. Dogs and drivers stopped at roadhouses for food and sleep. By the 1920s, planes took over from dogs. In 1925, a disease called diphtheria struck Nome. The cure was in Anchorage, but planes were new and unreliable in cold weather, so dogs were used instead. Over 1,000 kilometers were covered in six days by twenty dog teams. Leonhard Seppala and his dog Togo did the first part, and Gunnar Kaasen with his lead dog Balto finished it. Balto saved the team from danger. The medicine stopped the disease, and Balto became famous. Today, an annual dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome follows this route and is called the Iditarod, known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.","THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH

Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and has become known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.","During the 1880s, gold was discovered in Alaska, attracting numerous prospectors seeking wealth. This led to the rapid growth of new settlements, such as Iditarod, a term meaning 'distant place'. By 1909, Iditarod had briefly become Alaska's largest city. While supplies could be delivered by boat in summer, winter freezes made this impossible, prompting the creation of a winter trail in 1910 for dog sled teams to transport essential items like mail, food, and clothing to miners. Known as the Iditarod Trail, the journey across Alaska took approximately three weeks, with stops at roadhouses for rest and provisions. The trail was used annually until the 1920s, when airplanes superseded dog teams as the primary transport method. However, in 1925, diphtheria struck Nome, and the nearest serum was in Anchorage. Due to the novelty of aviation and the absence of a skilled pilot, dog teams were employed to cover the over 1,000-kilometer distance along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty teams completed the relay in just six days; Leonhard Seppala and his dog Togo navigated the initial 400 kilometers, relying on Togo's guidance in severe conditions, while Gunnar Kaasen and his lead dog Balto handled the final leg, with Balto preventing a potential disaster by avoiding icy water. The successful delivery halted the outbreak, cementing Balto's heroic status. Presently, an annual sled dog race from Anchorage to Nome retraces this historic route, celebrated as the Iditarod, often referred to as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.","In the 1880s, the discovery of gold in Alaska precipitated an influx of fortune-seekers, fostering the swift expansion of nascent towns, among them Iditarod, etymologically denoting a 'remote locale'. By 1909, Iditarod had ephemerally ascended to become the state's most populous city. Although maritime transport facilitated supply deliveries in summer, winter freezes rendered such avenues impracticable, culminating in the establishment of a winter trail in 1910 for canine-drawn sleds to convey indispensable commodities such as mail, sustenance, and attire to gold miners. Designated the Iditarod Trail, this route necessitated roughly three weeks for traversal, with intermittent halts at roadhouses affording respite and sustenance for both mushers and their teams. Its utilization persisted each winter until the 1920s, when aviation gradually supplanted dog teams as the predominant mode of transport. Nonetheless, in 1925, an outbreak of diphtheria in Nome necessitated the procurement of antitoxin from Anchorage; given the incipient nature of aircraft and the unavailability of a proficient pilot, a canine relay was orchestrated along the Iditarod Trail. Spanning over 1,000 kilometers, the endeavor was accomplished in a mere six days by twenty teams: Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian immigrant, covered the initial 400 kilometers, relying on his dog Togo's adept navigation through blizzard conditions, while Gunnar Kaasen, an experienced musher, executed the concluding segment with his lead dog Balto, whose refusal to advance averted a perilous encounter with frigid waters. The serum's successful administration curbed the epidemic, and Balto was immortalized as a hero. Contemporary iterations include an annual sled dog race from Anchorage to Nome, retracing the 1925 journey and denominated the Iditarod, acclaimed as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'.","The late 19th-century gold rush in Alaska, initiated by the 1880s discoveries, engendered a rapid proliferation of settlements, including Iditarod, a toponym derived from an indigenous term signifying 'a far-distant place'. By 1909, Iditarod had transiently emerged as Alaska's largest urban center. While summer months permitted maritime conveyance of vital supplies, winter conditions, characterized by frozen waterways, necessitated the 1910 inauguration of a winter trail for dog-drawn sleds to transport mail, provisions, and garments to miners. This thoroughfare, christened the Iditarod Trail, required approximately three weeks for a team to traverse Alaska, with waystations known as roadhouses providing nocturnal accommodation and sustenance for drivers and canines alike. Annual usage persisted until the 1920s, when aeronautical advancements eclipsed canine transport. However, in 1925, a diphtheria epidemic in Nome mandated the urgent acquisition of serum from Anchorage; owing to the nascent state of aviation and the absence of Carl Eielson, the sole pilot deemed capable of such a flight, a relay of dog teams was deployed along the Iditarod Trail. Covering over 1,000 kilometers, the endeavor was consummated in six days by twenty teams: Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian expatriate, navigated the initial 400 kilometers, dependent on his dog Togo's unerring guidance through blinding snowstorms, while Gunnar Kaasen, with two decades of mushing experience, completed the final leg with his lead dog Balto, whose recalcitrance fortuitously precluded a catastrophic plunge into icy waters. The antitoxin's administration abated the outbreak, and Balto achieved legendary status. In contemporary times, an annual sled dog race from Anchorage to Nome, emulating the 1925 relay, is conducted under the appellation Iditarod, renowned as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London intending to study law, but went to art school instead. There he found the traditional drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting.
In his late twenties he was given money by the Italian government to study art, and became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and wanted to put this light into his paintings.
This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark, but he insists he's never sure what the results will be. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.'
Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not do the painting afterwards.
Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.'
Since moving to London years ago, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters.

","Craigie Aitchison, a painter born in Scotland, initially intended to study law in London but instead attended art school. Although he found traditional drawing classes challenging, he persisted with painting. In his late twenties, he received funding from the Italian government to study art, developing an interest in early Italian artists that influenced his work.

In his late twenties, he was the recipient of a bursary from the Italian government, catalyzing his engagement with early Italian masters, an inspiration manifest in segments of his portfolio. Enamored of the chromatic palette—greens and browns—and the crystalline luminosity of the Italian terrain, he sought to transmute this radiance into his artistic compositions. This pursuit precipitated his methodology of applying diaphanous layers of pigment sequentially from light to dark, though he professes uncertainty regarding the eventual results, asserting, 'It's a secret—because I don't know myself.' In contradistinction to certain contemporaries, he forgoes preliminary drawings to forestall ennui, instead undertaking numerous revisions prior to a work's completion. This elucidates his predilection for models who abstain from viewing the painting in progress, as their disquiet would obstruct his creative impetus.

In contemporary society, the majority of urban centers host a zoo or wildlife park. Yet, zoos do not garner universal approval. Advocates posit that zoos afford us the prospect to acquire knowledge about the natural world and foster a connection with wild fauna, experiences that would be unfeasible in the absence of such institutions. In contrast, detractors condemn zoos on the grounds that incarcerating animals is morally indefensible, and they highlight that in zoos with substandard management, animals are subjected to squalid environments and nutritionally deficient diets.","The establishment of zoos commenced over three thousand years ago, with the Chinese sovereigns founding an expansive zoological park designated as the Gardens of Intelligence.

101,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival, an annual nine-day event.
The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. There were about a dozen hot-air balloons and they took off from the car park in the middle of Albuquerque. From these small beginnings, the festival has grown steadily. This year at least a thousand balloons from over one third of the countries of the world are expected at its current out-of-town site.
What to see
The pilots are in radio contact with each other and all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. These are known as 'balloon glows' and are an opportunity to take fantastic photographs. However, you must arrive just after night has fallen or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky.
During the day, you can walk around among the balloons and chat to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colours, some in the shapes of animals or cartoon characters and, of course, well-known products such as varieties of soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it.
In the afternoon, why not take to the sky yourself by arranging a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering balloon rides? Another possibility is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest such ride anywhere, and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are plenty of other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and firework displays on the opening evening and the last three evenings of the festival.
The Albuquerque Box
This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds, and at the same time create gentler currents of wind at different heights. This means that by rising or descending, skilful pilots can control the direction of their balloons.
Practical advice
Buy your tickets in advance (they are available on line) and save yourself a long wait to get into the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. At night and in the early morning it can be quite cool, but during the day sunglasses and suncream are essential. Bring a flashlight for night-time events and, of course, bring your camera.

Options for participation include arranging a hot-air balloon flight over the desert or taking the lengthy cable car to mountain peaks for an aerial perspective of the festivities. Additional attractions encompass balloon races and firework displays on the opening and final evenings. The 'Albuquerque Box,' a local wind phenomenon, provides ideal conditions by shielding balloons from strong winds with the Sandia Mountains and enabling pilots to navigate by adjusting altitude. Practical tips advise purchasing tickets in advance online to bypass long queues, dressing in layers for fluctuating temperatures, using sunglasses and suncream, carrying a flashlight for nighttime activities, and bringing a camera with high-speed film if not digital for evening shots.","Annually in autumn, the Albuquerque Balloon Festival enlivens the skies above the desert metropolis of Albuquerque in the south-western United States, presenting a nine-day spectacle of brilliant hues. Inaugurated in 1972 to commemorate the 50th birthday of a local radio station, the festival debuted with approximately a dozen hot-air balloons ascending from a central parking lot. It has since evolved substantially, anticipating the participation of at least a thousand balloons from more than one-third of the globe's countries at its contemporary out-of-town location. The event features 'balloon glows,' wherein pilots, maintaining radio communication, synchronize the illumination of their burners, offering prime photographic moments post-dusk or prior to 5:30 am as balloons ascend into the nocturnal sky. By day, spectators can meander amidst the balloons, conversing with aviators during pre-flight preparations. The assortment includes balloons of diverse dimensions and palettes, some crafted into animal, cartoon, or commercial product forms, ensuring familial enjoyment. Adventurous pursuits include securing a balloon excursion over the arid landscape or embarking on the world's longest cable car journey to mountainous summits for a panoramic vista. Enhancements such as balloon races and pyrotechnic displays occur on the inaugural and concluding evenings. The 'Albuquerque Box,' a distinctive wind configuration, fosters optimal flying conditions by utilizing the Sandia Mountains to mitigate harsh winds and generate stratified air currents, permitting adept pilots to maneuver directionally through altitude adjustments. For practicality, procure tickets online in advance to circumvent protracted entry delays, attire in layered garments to accommodate cool nights and warm days, apply sunglasses and suncream, equip a flashlight for nocturnal events, and utilize a camera with high-speed film if analog for low-light imagery.","Each autumn, the celestial expanse above Albuquerque, a desert city in the south-western United States, is transmuted into a kaleidoscopic panorama during the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day annual extravaganza. Originating in 1972 to celebrate the quinquagenary of a local radio station, the inaugural event featured roughly a dozen hot-air balloons launching from an urban parking facility. It has burgeoned progressively, with projections of at least a thousand balloons from over one-third of the world's nations converging at its present exurban site. The phenomenon of 'balloon glows' entails pilots in radio concord simultaneously activating their burners, yielding sublime photographic opportunities during nocturnal or pre-dawn ascents. Diurnally, attendees can perambulate among the balloons, engaging in discourse with aeronauts as they orchestrate takeoffs. The fleet encompasses a vast array of dimensions and chromatic variations, including effigies of fauna, animated characters, and ubiquitous commercial products, captivating juvenile audiences. For aerial immersion, one may arrange a balloon voyage over the desert or ascend via the protracted cable car to mountainous apices for an ornithological perspective. Supplementary diversions include balloon competitions and pyrotechnic exhibitions on the inaugural and terminal evenings. The 'Albuquerque Box,' an indigenous wind paradigm, engenders idyllic conditions by leveraging the Sandia Mountains to attenuate vigorous gusts and engender stratified zephyrs, enabling virtuoso pilots to modulate trajectory through altitudinal variations. Pragmatically, secure tickets antecedently online to obviate protracted ingress queues, don stratiform attire for crepuscular and matutinal chill versus diurnal warmth, employ ocular protection and solar block, carry illumination for vespertine events, and utilize photographic apparatus with high-velocity emulsion if non-digital for crepuscular captures."
102,"The Young Achiever of the Year

Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion and has just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree.

After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a PS20,000 loan and begin her own womenswear label.

Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over PS500,000.

From a young age, she sketched clothing and created designs, yet she never disclosed to her diligent parents, proprietors of a supermarket, her ambition to pursue fashion professionally. Assuming they anticipated her entering a more conventional field, she enrolled in university for a management degree. Upon graduation, she relocated to London and secured a position in an advertising agency. While attending industry functions, she found herself unable to purchase the designer attire she admired, prompting her to craft her own skirts and tops. When her friends observed her creations, they requested custom pieces, leading her to partner with a small London boutique that accepted her designs on a sale-or-return basis. The items proved highly successful, with none being returned, motivating her to resign from advertising, secure a £20,000 loan, and launch her own womenswear brand. Her parents responded supportively to her career shift, expressing their backing, which greatly delighted her. Presently, her garments are available in more than 70 retail outlets, generating an income exceeding £500,000.

Presuming they envisaged her embarking upon a more established enterprise, she pursued a management degree at university. Subsequent to her studies, she migrated to London and was employed by an advertising agency. While obliged to frequent industry gatherings, she lacked the financial means to procure the designer apparel she favoured, inciting her to commence fabricating skirts and tops for her personal use. Upon her friends' admiration of her attire, they solicited bespoke items, which culminated in her securing an arrangement with a diminutive London establishment to vend her designs on a sale-or-return basis. The collections garnered substantial popularity, with no merchandise being returned, thereby incentivising her to depart from her advertising role, obtain a £20,000 loan, and inaugurate her own womenswear label. Her parents exhibited no displeasure regarding her professional transition and pledged their support, a development that profoundly gratified her. Currently, her creations are retailed in excess of 70 stores, yielding revenues surpassing £500,000.

From her earliest years, she immersed herself in drawing apparel and conceptualising designs, yet she eschewed disclosing to her assiduous parents, the proprietors of a supermarket, her desire to elevate her hobby into a professional pursuit. Conjecturing that they anticipated her entry into a more conventional business domain, she matriculated at university to undertake a management degree. Following her academic tenure, she relocated to London and assumed a position within an advertising agency. Compelled to attend industry functions, she found herself financially incapable of acquiring the designer garments she esteemed, which impelled her to initiate the creation of skirts and tops for her own utilisation. When her acquaintances beheld her sartorial innovations, they entreated her to produce garments for them, an entreaty that eventuated in her forging an accord with a petite London boutique to purvey her designs under a sale-or-return arrangement. The pieces achieved remarkable commercial success, with nary an item returned, thereby emboldening her to relinquish her advertising post, procure a £20,000 loan, and establish her eponymous womenswear label. Her parents evinced no consternation over her vocational reorientation and avowed their endorsement, a response that immensely elated her. Presently, her sartorial offerings are vended in over 70 establishments, accruing an annual revenue in excess of £500,000. Her designs are promulgated in fashion glossies, she executes commissions for pop icons, and she has recently garnered public approbation through this accolade. Contemplating the prodigious evolution of her venture, she recognises her profound serendipity whilst accentuating the indefatigable industry she has dedicated to its fruition."

You could win PS1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story printed in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky people will win a cheque forPS100.
Once again, we need people who can write good stories.

Write about what you know
This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends - these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way.
Get your facts right
It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it.
Hold the reader's attention
Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end.
Think about the characters
Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.

As a secretary, although I was earning a reasonable amount of money, I was bored doing something where I hardly had to think. I became more and more depressed by the idea that I was stuck in the job. I was jealous of the students at the local university, who looked happy, carefree and full of hope, and part of something that I wanted to explore further.
However, now that I've actually become a student I find it hard to mix with younger colleagues. They are always mistaking me for a lecturer and asking me questions I can't answer. I also feel separated from the lecturers because, although we are the same age, I know so much less than them. But I am glad of this opportunity to study because I know you need a qualification to get a rewarding job, which is really important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I much prefer a weekend with my books to one out partying. Then there are the normal student benefits of long holidays and theatre and cinema discounts. I often have doubts about what I'll do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this late date has been a wise choice.","At 32, I have just completed my first year at university. In addition to attending lectures regularly, I have had to acquire the skills to read books rapidly and compose lengthy essays. I made the decision to enroll in university after a fourteen-year hiatus from education. Previously employed as a secretary, I was earning a reasonable salary, but I grew increasingly bored with a role that required minimal intellectual engagement. The notion of being trapped in that job left me feeling progressively more despondent. I envied the students at the local university, who appeared joyful, carefree, and brimming with optimism, and I longed to partake in the experiences they were exploring. However, now that I am actually a student, I struggle to integrate with my younger peers. They frequently mistake me for a lecturer and pose questions that I am unable to answer. I also feel a disconnect from the lecturers; although we are contemporaries in age, my knowledge is substantially inferior to theirs. Nevertheless, I am appreciative of this opportunity to study, as I recognize that a qualification is essential for securing a fulfilling career, which holds great significance for me. In contrast to most eighteen-year-olds, I decidedly favor a weekend spent with my books over one dedicated to social festivities. Then there are the conventional student perks, such as extended holidays and discounts for theatre and cinema. I often harbor uncertainties about my post-university plans, but I aspire that pursuing my education at this later stage proves to be a prudent decision.","Having reached the age of 32, I have recently concluded my inaugural year at university. Beyond merely attending lectures with regularity, I have been compelled to master the art of rapid reading and the composition of extensive essays. My resolution to pursue higher education emerged after a fourteen-year absence from academic environments. In my prior capacity as a secretary, despite earning a respectable income, I was plagued by ennui due to the role's negligible demands on cognitive faculties. The perception of being irrevocably mired in that profession engendered a deepening sense of despondency. I felt a palpable envy towards the students at the local university, who exuded an aura of felicity, insouciance, and sanguine expectations, and I yearned to immerse myself in the intellectual pursuits they were engaging with. Conversely, now that I have assumed the mantle of a student, I encounter difficulties in assimilating with my junior counterparts. They routinely misconstrue me for a lecturer and interrogate me with queries beyond my ken. Additionally, I experience a sense of alienation from the lecturers; although we are of comparable age, my erudition pales in comparison to theirs. Nonetheless, I am profoundly grateful for this scholastic opportunity, cognizant that a formal qualification is indispensable for attaining a gratifying vocation, a objective of paramount importance to me. Diverging from the typical eighteen-year-old, I exhibit a pronounced predilection for weekends engrossed in literary pursuits rather than indulging in convivial revelries. Moreover, there are the customary student advantages, including protracted vacations and concessions for theatrical and cinematic performances. I frequently entertain misgivings regarding my trajectory subsequent to university, yet I harbor the hope that embarking on this educational endeavor at a more advanced juncture will be adjudged an astute choice.","At the age of 32, I have just culminated my first academic year at university. In addition to consistent lecture attendance, I have had to cultivate proficiencies in expeditious reading and the drafting of protracted essays. My decision to matriculate at a university was taken subsequent to a fourteen-year interlude from formal education. Previously employed in a secretarial capacity, I was remunerated adequately, yet I was afflicted by profound tedium owing to the role's scant intellectual stimulation. The conception of being perpetually entrenched in that occupation precipitated an escalating melancholia. I was consumed by envy for the students at the proximate university, who manifested an air of jubilation, nonchalance, and buoyant optimism, and I aspired to partake in the erudite explorations they were undertaking. However, now that I have actualized my status as a student, I grapple with integrating into the cohort of younger peers. They invariably misidentify me as a lecturer and proffer inquiries that exceed my purview. Furthermore, I sense a schism with the lecturers; despite our contemporaneity in age, my knowledge is markedly inferior to theirs. Notwithstanding, I am exceedingly appreciative of this opportunity for academic pursuit, as I am acutely aware that a credential is imperative for procuring a rewarding profession, an ambition of seminal import to me. In contradistinction to the majority of eighteen-year-olds, I evince a distinct proclivity for weekends devoted to bibliophilic endeavors over those spent in hedonistic carousing. Additionally, there exist the quintessential student perquisites, such as elongated recesses and subsidized access to theatrical and cinematic venues. I often harbor apprehensions concerning my post-graduation endeavors, but I am sanguine that initiating my scholarly journey at this belated stage will be deemed a sagacious resolution."

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1,500 kilometres, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T', which sold for $825. He was soon selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.

107,"The Ghan Train 

Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. 

The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. 
The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide as far as Alice Springs, but there was often serious flooding on the line making it difficult for trains to pass. A new line was completed a few months before my journey. 
The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph and the Ghan is certainly not a high- speed, inter-city train - there are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. Nor does the Ghan aim to provide luxury in the same way that a train like the Orient Express does, although the on-board food is excellent. 
The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. 
It is not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I could see that everyone was really looking forward to the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up the majority of my fellow travellers, were particularly keen to board. 
Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged nowadays and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. 
From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't particularly interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with nothing to look at but cattle. But at dawn on the third day we reached the foothills of an area close to the Southern Ocean. My journey was over and, although the train might not have delivered on everything the advertisements promise, it had taken me to several of the most amazing sights that Australia has to offer.

","Mark Ottaway journeyed by train from Darwin in northern Australia to Adelaide in the south aboard The Ghan. This train traverses the Australian continent, moving from the warm northern coast across vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. Often referred to as the 'famous Ghan', it is notably recognized for its frequent lateness. The aspiration for a rail connection between Darwin and Adelaide was partially realized in the 1920s with a line extending to Alice Springs, yet severe flooding frequently disrupted service. A new railway was completed shortly before Mark's trip. Designed for speeds up to 115 kph, The Ghan is not a high-speed inter-city train; it has limited stops and caters mainly to holidaymakers. While it does not provide the luxury associated with trains like the Orient Express, the on-board cuisine is outstanding. Initially, the railway was constructed for freight transport rather than passengers, under the assumption that shipping goods from Europe to Australia's populous south via Darwin and rail would be more efficient than maritime routes around the continent. As the world's inaugural north-south transcontinental railway, The Ghan's completion is significant. Upon boarding, Mark observed that all passengers, particularly the Australian retirees who formed the majority, were eagerly anticipating the journey. The first halt was at Katherine, where the train paused for four hours, allowing some passengers to embark on a boat excursion through the gorge. Mark disembarked at Alice Springs to undertake a two-day guided tour to Uluru with a small group; climbing the rock is now discouraged, so they circumnavigated it and admired the sunset. From Alice Springs, two weekly trains head south, prompting many travellers to interrupt their journey there. The scenery beyond Alice Springs is predominantly flat and uneventful, dotted with cattle. At dawn on the third day, they arrived at the foothills near the Southern Ocean. Although the train fell short of some advertised promises, it enabled Mark to experience several of Australia's most spectacular landmarks.","Mark Ottaway embarked on a rail journey from Darwin in northern Australia to Adelaide in the south via The Ghan. This train crosses the Australian continent, proceeding from the balmy northern coast through seemingly interminable deserts to the chillier Southern Ocean. Dubbed the 'famous Ghan', it is perhaps regrettably renowned primarily for its punctuality issues. The vision of a rail link connecting Darwin and Adelaide was partially actualized in the 1920s with a line reaching Alice Springs, though recurrent severe flooding impeded train passage. A new line had been finalized mere months prior to Mark's expedition. Engineered for velocities up to 115 kph, The Ghan is decidedly not a high-speed inter-city service; it features infrequent stops and its clientele consists almost entirely of vacationers. Nor does it aspire to the opulence epitomized by trains such as the Orient Express, albeit the culinary offerings on board are superlative. The railway was originally conceived for freight transportation, predicated on the notion that conveying goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and rail would economize time and expenses relative to circumnavigating the continent by sea. As the purported world's first north-south transcontinental railway, its inauguration is a milestone. While awaiting departure, Mark noted the palpable anticipation among all passengers, with Australian pensioners, who constituted the bulk of his fellow travellers, being especially eager. The initial stop was Katherine, where the train idled for four hours, enabling some passengers to undertake a boat voyage through the gorge. Mark remained aboard until Alice Springs, whence he participated in a two-day excursion to Uluru with a compact cohort and a guide; ascents of the rock are now discouraged and seldom attempted, so their group merely ambulated around it and lingered to observe the magnificent sunset. From Alice Springs, two weekly trains proceed southward, leading many passengers to pause their journeys there. The vista from the train post-Alice Springs is largely monotonous, characterized by expansive flatlands inhabited chiefly by cattle. However, at dawn on the third day, they attained the foothills adjacent to the Southern Ocean. Mark's voyage concluded, and while the train may not have fulfilled all promotional assurances, it facilitated his encounter with several of Australia's most breathtaking spectacles.","Mark Ottaway undertook a rail expedition aboard The Ghan, traversing from Darwin in Australia's northern reaches to Adelaide in the south. This locomotive courses across the Australian continent, journeying from the temperate northern littoral through ostensibly boundless deserts to the more frigid Southern Ocean. Often denominated the 'famous Ghan', it is perhaps inauspicious that its foremost notoriety stems from chronic delays. The aspiration for a Darwin-Adelaide rail connection was partially materialized in the 1920s with a line extending to Alice Springs, yet incessant and severe inundations frequently obstructed transit. A novel railway had been consummated a few months antecedent to Mark's peregrination. Constructed for celerities up to 115 kph, The Ghan is unequivocally not a high-speed inter-city train; it boasts scant stops and its ridership is predominantly composed of holidaymakers. Furthermore, it does not endeavor to emulate the luxury proffered by trains such as the Orient Express, although the gastronomic provisions on board are exemplary. The railway's inception was for freight conveyance, predicated on the hypothesis that transporting merchandise from Europe to Australia's densely inhabited southern regions via Darwin and rail would be more expeditious and economical than maritime circumnavigation of the continent. As the professed world's inaugural north-south transcontinental railway, its realization is a seminal achievement. Whilst awaiting embarkation, Mark discerned that all passengers were fervently anticipating the voyage, with Australian pensioners, who constituted the majority of his compatriots, exhibiting particular zeal. The primary stop was Katherine, where the train tarried for a quadrihour, permitting certain passengers to embark on a nautical excursion through the gorge. Mark did not alight until Alice Springs, where he engaged in a bicameral guided tour to Uluru with a select coterie; scaling the rock is now deprecated and infrequently undertaken, so their assembly merely perambulated the formation and remained to witness the resplendent sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two hebdomadal trains southbound, inducing numerous passengers to intermit their journeys there. The prospect from the train subsequent to Alice Springs is largely insipid, dominated by vast plains with naught but bovine herds to observe. Nevertheless, at dawn on the tertiary diurnal segment, they attained the piedmont regions proximate to the Southern Ocean. Mark's odyssey concluded, and although the train may not have actualized all promotional pledges, it afforded him access to several of Australia's most awe-inspiring vistas."

Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road.
Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Uneven movements can make a car suddenly very difficult to control. So every time you either turn the wheel, touch the brakes or increase your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Imagine you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it.
Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

Fog may loom over a hill, while ice concealed beneath melting snow threatens to force your vehicle off the road. Oncoming cars might unexpectedly skid across the roadway. The primary rule for navigating icy roads is to drive smoothly, as abrupt actions can render the car uncontrollable. Whenever steering, braking, or accelerating, execute these maneuvers as gently and gradually as possible. Envision driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the passenger seat, aiming not to spill a drop. The second rule involves maintaining heightened awareness of potential hazards; increased ice necessitates looking further ahead. Assess stopping distances by applying the brakes gently, and bear in mind that your speed may be higher than perceived. Typically, allow twice the standard stopping distance on wet surfaces, three times that on snow, and an even greater margin on ice. By consistently retaining control of your vehicle, you can avert difficulties.","Winter driving is perilous owing to the inherent difficulty in anticipating events and the propensity for accidents to transpire with ease. Fog may await atop a hill, and ice lurking beneath thawing snow can precipitate a loss of vehicular control, potentially ejecting you from the roadway. An approaching automobile might abruptly skid across the path. The foremost principle for traversing icy roads is to operate the vehicle with smoothness; irregular motions can precipitously compromise controllability. Thus, whenever executing a turn, applying the brakes, or augmenting velocity, one must do so with utmost gentleness and deliberation. Conceptualize driving with an brimming cup of scalding coffee adjacent; maneuver in such a manner as to preclude any spillage. The secondary rule entails vigilant attention to potential eventualities; the extent of ice dictates the necessity to survey the road far ahead. Gauge braking distances through gentle deceleration, and remain cognizant that your actual speed may exceed subjective estimates. In general, allocate double the customary stopping interval on damp pavements, triple on snow-covered surfaces, and an even more considerable buffer on ice. By perpetually exercising command over your automobile, you will circumvent adversities.","Winter driving constitutes a hazardous endeavor, largely attributable to the formidable challenge of prognosticating occurrences and the facile manner in which mishaps can materialize. Nebulous fog might be poised to envelop you upon cresting a hill, whilst glacial ice, secreted beneath the melting snow, lies in wait to destabilize your trajectory and expel you from the thoroughfare. A vehicle approaching from the opposite direction could inadvertently careen across the road. The paramount axiom for navigating glaciated roads is to drive with seamless fluidity; any discordant movements can instantaneously induce a precipitous decline in vehicular mastery. Consequently, each instance of turning the steering wheel, engaging the brakes, or escalating momentum must be performed with exceptional delicacy and languor. Envisage piloting your car with a receptacle of piping hot coffee filled to capacity beside you; operate in a fashion that ensures not a droplet is displaced. The subsequent precept involves assiduously heeding potential eventualities; the prevalence of ice necessitates a protracted visual sweep down the roadway. Ascertain halting distances by means of gentle braking applications, and retain awareness that your velocity may be more rapid than apprehended. Customarily, appropriate twice the conventional stopping span on rain-slicked roads, thrice that distance on snowy expanses, and an even more extensive interval on icy surfaces. By incessantly preserving dominion over your conveyance, you shall obviate complications."
109,"Shopping for furniture 

A report by Dave Worthington 

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for PS45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for PS30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced that it wouldn't close at all for the first 24 hours. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: 'The police had been informed that a large crowd was expected but people just weren't patient. The shop was soon full and the managers sensibly decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and they refused to queue quietly until there was space for them inside. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What I really couldn't believe was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop.

A report by Dave Worthington 

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for PS45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for PS30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced that it wouldn't close at all for the first 24 hours. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: 'The police had been informed that a large crowd was expected but people just weren't patient. The shop was soon full and the managers sensibly decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and they refused to queue quietly until there was space for them inside. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What I really couldn't believe was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. This meant that the road was then completely blocked.' 
One customer, Jenny Smith, who managed to get into the shop, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They didn't have any choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.' 
","Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was compelled to close shortly after its midnight opening last Thursday. Approximately 6,000 individuals hurried to the store, attracted by special promotions such as a leather sofa available for £45 until 3 am and a bed for £30 between 3 am and 8 am. Although Homestyle had intended to remain open for 24 hours continuously, it had to shut within half an hour due to overcrowding. A police officer reported that despite prior warnings about the expected large crowd, people lacked patience. The shop rapidly filled, prompting managers to close the doors for safety. Those outside grew furious, concerned that all items would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait orderly in the queue. Additionally, a long line of cars attempting to access the car park caused traffic issues, with many drivers abandoning their vehicles in the road, completely blocking it. Jenny Smith, a customer who entered the shop, mentioned queuing for three hours without making a purchase but praised the staff for their calm explanations. She intends to revisit when the shop reopens but is unwilling to endure another long queue.","Homestyle, a newly established furniture retailer, was forced to cease operations mere moments after its inaugural opening at midnight last Thursday. An estimated 6,000 patrons flocked to the premises, drawn by exclusive deals such as a leather sofa priced at £45, available only until 3 am, and a bed offered for £30 between 3 am and 8 am. Despite plans to operate uninterrupted for the initial 24 hours, the shop had to close within thirty minutes of opening. A police officer dispatched to the scene noted that although authorities had been alerted to the anticipated large gathering, the crowd exhibited a lack of patience. The venue quickly reached capacity, leading managers to prudently decide on closure. Exterior individuals became incensed, fearing that merchandise would be entirely sold out before their entry, and they declined to queue in an orderly fashion. Compounding the issue, a substantial queue of vehicles striving to reach the car park resulted in numerous drivers deserting their cars in the roadway, thereby causing a complete obstruction. Jenny Smith, a customer who succeeded in entering, recounted queuing for three hours without procuring her desired items, yet she commended the staff for their composed demeanor and clear communication. She expressed intent to return upon the shop's reopening but avowed an unwillingness to queue again.","Homestyle, a nascent furniture emporium, was impelled to terminate its activities shortly subsequent to its midnight inauguration last Thursday. A throng of up to 6,000 individuals converged upon the establishment, enticed by promotional incentives including a leather sofa retailing for £45—available solely until 3 am—and a bed procurable for £30 during the interval from 3 am to 8 am. Notwithstanding the declared intention to maintain ceaseless operation for the first 24 hours, the shop was obliged to close within half an hour of commencement. A law enforcement official summoned to the locale remarked that, despite prior notification of an anticipated multitude, the assemblage demonstrated a dearth of forbearance. The premises swiftly attained full capacity, necessitating a judicious decision by management to secure the doors. Those exterior to the shop grew irate, apprehensive that all commodities would be vended prior to their admittance, and they eschewed orderly queuing. Furthermore, an extensive procession of automobiles endeavoring to access the parking facility culminated in numerous motorists opting to forsake their vehicles mid-street, traversing the final meters on foot, which resulted in the thoroughfare's complete impediment. Jenny Smith, a patron who managed ingress, attested to having queued for three hours without effecting a purchase, yet she lauded the personnel for their equanimity and elucidations. She articulated her design to revisit upon the shop's resumption of business but disavowed any propensity to endure another queue."

Those pieces that are accepted can be accessed on the Eight-eighteen website. The agency maintains three centers across the country where young people can interact with peers and engage in various projects, with intentions to expand nationally. Established in 1994 under the name 'Young News', it has involved over 2,500 youths. Sophie, a former member, recounts her initial encounter when she was interviewed for an article on young people's views about hip hop music. She was astonished by the opportunities afforded to the young journalists, noting that age was irrelevant as they were entrusted to handle stories independently. She began attending a local center, received training, and remained a member until turning 18. The experience enabled her to surpass her expectations, acquiring skills that led to employment at age 19 as the youngest staff member on a major news website, where she verifies articles before publication. Upon joining, individuals undergo training and participate in monthly meetings to assign responsibilities for news stories. The agency promotes skill-sharing through 'peer trainers'—experienced members aged 12 and above who instruct newcomers in fundamental journalism.

The organization sustains three centers nationwide facilitating interaction among young members and involvement in projects, with aspirations to inaugurate additional centers across the country. Since its inception in 1994, originally denominated 'Young News', in excess of 2,500 adolescents have participated. Sophie, an alumna, reflects on her initial awareness arising from an interview for a piece concerning youthful perspectives on hip hop music; she was captivated by the prospects available to the juvenile journalists, emphasizing that age was inconsequential as they were conferred autonomy in story production. She commenced attendance at a municipal center, acquired training, and maintained membership until reaching 18 years of age. Eight-eighteen facilitated her in attaining accomplishments beyond her anticipations, equipping her with competencies that secured her a position at 19 as the most junior employee on a major news website, tasked with scrutinizing journalists' articles prior to online deployment. Incorporation into the agency entails training and engagement in monthly assemblies to delegate authorship of news stories. Eight-eighteen fosters skill interchange via 'peer trainers'—seasoned members aged 12 and above who mentor novices in elementary journalistic techniques. As trainers accrue proficiency, certain members conduct presentations for external juvenile and adult assemblies in venues such as youth clubs and summer camps, invariably supported by senior staff accompanists.

The agency operates three centers dispersed throughout the nation, serving as hubs for youthful members to convene and participate in collaborative endeavors, while harboring ambitions to establish further centers on a national scale. Originating in 1994 under the appellation 'Young News', the organization has enlisted over 2,500 young participants. Sophie, a former affiliate, recounts her inaugural exposure during an interview for a feature on adolescent viewpoints regarding hip hop music; she was profoundly impressed by the opportunities extended to the youthful correspondents, noting that chronological age was immaterial as they were endowed with the trust to execute stories autonomously. She initiated her involvement by frequenting a local center, underwent instructional sessions, and perpetuated her membership until the age of 18. Eight-eighteen empowered her to realize achievements surpassing her initial expectations, imparting skills that culminated in her employment at age 19 as the most junior incumbent on a major news website, wherein she undertakes the vetting of articles composed by journalists before their online publication. Upon enrollment, inductees receive training and contribute to monthly convocations to allocate responsibilities for news story authorship. The agency encourages the exchange of competencies through 'peer trainers'—adept members aged 12 and above who tutor neophytes in foundational journalistic practices. As these trainers amass experience, select members deliver expositions to external audiences comprising both juveniles and adults in environments such as youth clubs and summer camps, invariably accompanied by senior staff providing ancillary support.

I'm Nathalie. Last year I was one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous as I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered round, asking me questions, all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved enormously and I understand my teachers. 
For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me and when she left, I was a bit sad. In fact, I called home late at night once to speak to her because I felt a little lonely. 
Compared with my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. That makes me confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. 
Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops - even during December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10oC, but the Russians said it was mild for the time of year! At least it was warm and cosy in my room.

","My name is Nathalie, and last year I became one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov Ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. During my initial ballet class, I was quite nervous as I didn't know anyone there. Everyone gathered around, posing questions in Russian, but when I attempted to respond in Russian, they switched to English, enabling us to communicate effectively. Now, after six months, everyone is exceptionally kind, my Russian has improved enormously, and I comprehend my instructors fully. For the first fortnight after my arrival, my mother remained with me; her departure left me feeling somewhat despondent. In fact, I once phoned home late at night to speak with her due to feelings of loneliness. In comparison to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are considerably more demanding, so I consume large quantities of food to sustain my energy levels, which bolsters my confidence in performing to the institution's rigorous standards. In the evenings, I often watch my favourite films on my computer, though I occasionally doze off before the conclusion. Having settled in, I now feel thoroughly at home. I take pleasure in strolling through the city and exploring various shops, even during December when I was astonished by the intense cold. I purchased a fur hat as the temperature dropped to minus ten degrees Celsius, yet the locals remarked that it was mild for the season. Fortunately, my room was always warm and comfortable.

At my inaugural ballet class, I experienced considerable nervousness owing to my unfamiliarity with the other students. The group congregated around me, inquiring in Russian; when I endeavoured to articulate a response in Russian, they transitioned to English, thereby facilitating our communication. Presently, six months later, the individuals are exceedingly amicable, my proficiency in Russian has advanced significantly, and I fully apprehend my educators' instructions. Subsequent to my arrival, my mother accompanied me for the initial two weeks; upon her departure, I felt somewhat melancholy and, on one occasion, contacted her late at night to alleviate my sense of solitude. Relative to my prior ballet training in England, the Russian curriculum is substantially more arduous, necessitating that I consume copious amounts of sustenance to maintain my vigour, which in turn fortifies my assurance in meeting the academy's exacting benchmarks. During evenings, I frequently view my preferred cinematic works on my computer, albeit I sometimes succumb to slumber prior to the film's conclusion. Now that I have acclimatised, I feel genuinely ensconced in this environment. I derive satisfaction from ambulating through the urban landscape and perusing diverse retail establishments, even in December when I was incredulous at the severe cold. I procured a fur hat as temperatures plunged to minus ten degrees Celsius, yet native Russians commented that such conditions were temperate for the period. Fortunately, my quarters remained sufficiently warm and snug. Currently, we are immersed in preparations for an impending production, and there is a forthcoming competition for youthful dancers that I plan to enter.

Upon my attempt to articulate a response in their tongue, they graciously shifted to English, thereby enabling efficacious dialogue. Now, half a year hence, the cohort exhibits remarkable cordiality, my command of Russian has undergone profound enhancement, and I possess a comprehensive understanding of my pedagogues' directives. In the aftermath of my arrival, my mother sojourned with me for a fortnight; her subsequent departure induced a modicum of despondency, prompting a nocturnal telephone call to assuage my transient solitude. In juxtaposition with my ballet institution in England, the Russian pedagogical regimen is exponentially more strenuous, compelling me to ingest substantial repasts to sustain my metabolic demands, which in turn instils confidence in my capacity to fulfil the establishment's lofty criteria. During vespertine hours, I often engage in viewing my favoured cinematographic productions on my computer, though I intermittently lapse into somnolence before the denouement. Having now thoroughly acclimated, I feel unequivocally integrated into this milieu. I take delight in perambulating through the metropolis and investigating its multifarious emporia, even amidst December's frigid clime, which I found astonishingly severe. I acquired a fur hat when temperatures descended to minus ten degrees Celsius, yet indigenous Russians deemed it comparatively mild for the season. Fortuitously, my chamber remained perpetually temperate and inviting. Presently, we are engrossed in rehearsals for an imminent production, and a competition for aspiring dancers looms, which I intend to contest. I deem myself extraordinarily privileged to be in residence here."

It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh, Morocco. It doesn't happen frequently and when it does, the city's water pipes can't manage the sudden floods, which turn the streets into rivers. But, as many winters have remained dry in recent times, when the rain does come, it is welcomed by the local people. 
Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist, not because of the rain, but thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. Basically dry places, which receive their water in this way, are known as oases. 
Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here every available piece of land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background. 

",B1,"In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. It does not rain often. When it rains a lot, the water pipes cannot hold all the water. The streets become rivers. But people are happy when it rains because many winters are dry. The parks and gardens in Marrakesh have water from old underground channels. These channels bring water from the mountains. Dry places with water like this are called oases. South of Marrakesh is Skoura. In Skoura, people use water channels to make small squares of land for growing food. The Atlas mountains are in the background. They have snow in winter.","In Marrakesh, Morocco, rain can fall between November and March, but it is not frequent.

","In Marrakesh, Morocco, rainfall can occur at any time from November to March, though it is infrequent. When it does rain heavily, the city's water infrastructure is unable to cope with the sudden flooding, resulting in streets that resemble rivers. Nonetheless, as many winters have been dry in recent years, the local population appreciates the rain when it arrives. The parks and gardens in Marrakesh are sustained not by rainfall but by an ancient network of underground channels, constructed in the 11th century, which continuously supply water from the mountains. Such arid regions that receive water through such systems are referred to as oases. Travelling further south to Skoura, one finds that all available land is utilized, with water channels creating small plots for agriculture. The Atlas mountains, which are snow-capped in winter, form a picturesque backdrop.","In Marrakesh, Morocco, precipitation is possible between November and March, albeit infrequently. During these episodes of intense rainfall, the urban water management systems are overwhelmed by sudden floods, transforming the streets into torrential waterways. However, given the prevalence of arid winters in recent times, the arrival of rain is greeted with approval by the local inhabitants. The existence of Marrakesh's parks and gardens is attributable not to rainfall but to a historic network of subterranean channels, excavated in the 11th century, which perpetually convey water from the mountainous regions. These artificially irrigated arid zones are designated as oases. Proceeding further south to Skoura, every tract of arable land is meticulously segmented by irrigation channels into diminutive plots dedicated to cultivation. The Atlas mountains, adorned with snow in winter, provide an enchanting scenic panorama.","In Marrakesh, Morocco, intermittent rainfall may manifest during the period from November to March, though such occurrences are sporadic. When deluges transpire, the municipal aqueducts prove inadequate to manage the abrupt inundations, culminating in thoroughfares that emulate fluvial courses. Nevertheless, owing to the succession of parched winters in contemporary years, the advent of precipitation is met with approbation by the indigenous populace. The verdancy of Marrakesh's parks and gardens is sustained not by meteorological phenomena but by an archaic labyrinth of subterranean conduits, hewn in the 11th century, which incessantly channel hydrous resources from the orographic sources. Such xeric environments, artificially hydrated via these means, are denominated as oases. Venturing further meridionally to Skoura, one observes that every viable parcel of terrain is systematically apportioned by hydraulic channels into minuscule quadrants for agrarian purposes. The Atlas range, mantled in nival deposits during the hibernal season, constitutes a sublime topographical backdrop."
114,"THE ICEHOTEL 

For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. In the winter of 1990 the French artist Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night a group of foreign guests decided it would be a good idea to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The following morning the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today it is world famous. 
As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed. As the ICEHOTEL is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season, the finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. 
Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC, however cold it may be outside. Winter outer clothes such as warm overalls, hats and gloves are included in the cost of guests' stay at the hotel. In addition to this, it is a good idea for guests to bring sweaters and a scarf as well as plenty of woollen socks and to choose footwear that is larger than normal to allow space for thick socks. 
If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these and the equipment you will need at the same time as you book your visit. The items will be delivered to your room when you check in. 
The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Transport by bus can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL.

","The Icehotel originated from an idea in 1990, when guests slept in an igloo exhibition hall in Jukkasjarvi and found the experience enjoyable, leading to its global fame. Annually, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists constructs the hotel using natural winter materials, with sections opening progressively from December until completion around January 7th, though plans may change due to weather. The interior temperature remains between -5°C and -8°C, regardless of external conditions. Warm outer clothing is provided, but guests are advised to bring additional sweaters, scarves, and thick woollen socks, opting for larger footwear. Warm clothing and equipment can be purchased via the ICEHOTEL website during booking and will be delivered upon arrival. Located in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle, it is easily accessible from Kiruna airport and train station, with bus transport arrangements available.","The Icehotel's inception dates back to 1990, when a group of international guests opted to overnight in an igloo-structured exhibition hall in Jukkasjarvi, an experience that catalyzed the concept of a renowned global attraction. Each winter, a collaborative team of snow builders, architects, and artists converges to erect the hotel from seasonal natural elements, with phased openings commencing in December and culminating around January 7th, subject to alterations owing to climatic dependencies. Internally, temperatures are maintained within a range of -5°C to -8°C, irrespective of external frigidity. Provisions include insulated outerwear, yet guests are recommended to supplement with sweaters, scarves, and ample woollen socks, selecting footwear with additional room. Pre-arrival purchases of essential items can be made through the ICEHOTEL website concurrent with reservation, ensuring delivery at check-in. Situated in Jukkasjarvi village, 200 kilometers beyond the Arctic Circle, it boasts proximity to Kiruna airport and train station, with coordinated bus transfers facilitating access.","The genesis of the Icehotel can be traced to the winter of 1990, when an assemblage of foreign visitors, having partaken in an exhibition within a specially constructed igloo in Jukkasjarvi, elected to spend the night, thereby inaugurating an enterprise that has since achieved worldwide renown. Annually, upon winter's onset, a consortium of snow builders, architects, and artists from diverse global locales assembles to fabricate the hotel utilizing indigenous wintry materials, with sequential inaugurations of sections from December through to approximate completion on January 7th, albeit subject to meteorological vicissitudes that may necessitate plan modifications. The interior ambient temperature is rigorously regulated to remain between -5°C and -8°C, notwithstanding external climatic extremes. While thermal outer garments are encompassed within the accommodation fee, patrons are prudent to procure additional sweaters, scarves, and copious woollen hosiery, electing footwear of augmented dimensions to accommodate such insulation. Necessities may be procured via the ICEHOTEL digital portal during the reservation process, with items dispatched to one's quarters upon arrival. Nestled in the hamlet of Jukkasjarvi, situated 200 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, the establishment is merely 15 kilometers from Kiruna aerodrome and 17 kilometers from the railway terminus, with bus conveyance readily orchestratable."

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. 'Here again' is a followup to 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums.
It is clear from the first song on the CD which is a dance tune that the band is no longer going to concentrate on slow songs. The second tune is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most later lacks are in the bands more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single though because they are excellent.
Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has rented in the band having to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as dl the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.)
On this CD Moonshine show they can produce perfect music in a variety of styles from the slow ones we are familiar with to the ones that will keep your feet tapping. I did feel though that they put their best songs at the beginning and the last few tracks were not of quite the same quality.

Despite thisHere again is certain to be a big hit and bring more success to this band.

","Moonshine has just launched their third album, 'Here again', which serves as a sequel to 'The Waves'. The band has undergone several changes, with Tom Wilcott taking over on bass guitar from Simon McVee, who departed last year, and Tom Simpson arriving as the new drummer. From the outset, the CD indicates a shift in focus; the opening track is a dance number, diverging from their typical slow songs, and the second track is an even more intense and heavy dance tune. While most subsequent tracks revert to the band's familiar slow style, these initial two are likely to astonish fans and possess the potential to become hit singles due to their high quality. Vocalist Rob Letchford demonstrates his exceptional talent by hitting every note flawlessly. Fortunately, he recorded the album before encountering throat issues, which has necessitated the cancellation of their upcoming tour. Ticket holders need not concern themselves, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recuperated. This album showcases Moonshine's versatility in producing excellent music across various genres, from their customary slow pieces to energetic dance tracks. However, I felt that the strongest material is concentrated at the beginning, with the final tracks not quite matching that standard. Nonetheless, 'Here again' is poised to be a major success and will undoubtedly enhance the band's achievements.","Moonshine has recently unveiled their third CD, 'Here again', which follows their prior release, 'The Waves'. The band has experienced notable alterations, including Tom Wilcott assuming the role of bass guitarist in place of Simon McVee, who exited the group last year, and the incorporation of Tom Simpson as the drummer. The CD immediately signals a departure from their conventional repertoire; the inaugural track is a dance-oriented composition, indicating a move away from exclusively slow songs, and the subsequent piece is an even more robust and vigorous dance tune. Although the majority of the remaining tracks adhere to the band's characteristic slow style, these initial two are set to startle aficionados and are eminently capable of ascending to hit single status owing to their superior caliber. Rob Letchford, the vocalist, seizes the opportunity to exhibit his prowess, delivering each note with impeccable precision. It is fortunate that he committed these recordings to the album prior to developing throat complications, which have compelled the band to abort their forthcoming tour. Patrons who have procured tickets can rest assured that all performances will be reconvened upon Rob's convalescence. This CD exemplifies Moonshine's adeptness at crafting superlative music spanning a spectrum of styles, from the languid melodies with which we are acquainted to those that incite rhythmic engagement. I did perceive, however, that the premier compositions are positioned at the commencement, with the concluding tracks failing to uphold the same echelon of excellence. Despite this, 'Here again' is unequivocally destined for monumental success and will further the band's prosperity.","Moonshine has just issued their third CD, 'Here again', a direct successor to 'The Waves', marking a significant release last week. The ensemble has undergone substantial transformations, with Tom Wilcott now occupying the bass guitar position formerly held by Simon McVee, who departed the band the previous year, and the advent of Tom Simpson as the percussionist. From the very first track, a dance-infused melody, it becomes evident that the band is eschewing their erstwhile emphasis on slow compositions; the second track amplifies this shift with its even more resonant and weighty dance attributes. While the bulk of the subsequent pieces revert to the band's more customary slow genre, these initial two tracks are poised to disconcert many devotees and possess the inherent potential to emerge as hit singles, given their exemplary quality. Vocalist Rob Letchford capitalizes on this opportunity to manifest his consummate skill, attaining each note with flawless accuracy. It is propitious that he immortalized these performances for the album antecedent to encountering laryngeal difficulties, which have precipitated the cancellation of their imminent tour. Those who have secured tickets need not apprehend any inconvenience, as all concerts will be reorganized subsequent to Rob's full recovery. This CD attests to Moonshine's capacity to engender impeccable music across a diverse array of styles, from the placid strains we have grown accustomed to, to those that compel podal motion. Notwithstanding, I discerned that the quintessential compositions are concentrated at the inception, with the terminal tracks not quite commensurate in caliber. Irrespective of this, 'Here again' is incontrovertibly destined for prodigious success and will augur further triumphs for the band."

117,"Anna's new school 

It's been a very exciting week, as we've just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place, as the builders have used wood for the whole thing, just like in our old school, but it's also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. 
The school took months to build, so we saw it all happening. It was really exciting seeing the builders clear the space where it would be, although it also meant that some lovely open land disappeared. And the noise of the building machines was really loud, although the builders often had to stop work because it rained so hard. We all began to think the building would never be finished. 
We have five classrooms now, which are enormous - much bigger than in our previous school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town when they want to have meetings and so on. There's a nursery too, a lovely dining room, and really big changing rooms which we're looking forward to using as soon as our new sports field is ready. 
When you come into the school, one of the first things you notice is that there aren't any heaters in the building! Instead, the heat for the school comes from all of us inside it - the children, the teachers and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it holds all the heat inside - and all the sound too, so if we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we're inside a concert hall! 
Another thing you'll notice is that the school roof has a tree on top of it! It was put there by the builders once they'd finished the roof, because they said it was the custom in Austria, the country where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. It's so big, it can be seen for miles! We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. 
Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it - for example, at the moment we're putting on a play for parents to come and see, but we still have to walk back to our old school hall to do it. The replacement will be ready by next year, though. We're so pleased with our new school, and our teachers say we'll all learn much faster now we're in it!

When you come into the school, one of the first things you notice is that there aren't any heaters in the building! Instead, the heat for the school comes from all of us inside it - the children, the teachers and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it holds all the heat inside - and all the sound too, so if we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we're inside a concert hall! 
Another thing you'll notice is that the school roof has a tree on top of it! It was put there by the builders once they'd finished the roof, because they said it was the custom in Austria, the country where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. It's so big, it can be seen for miles! We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. 
Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it - for example, at the moment we're putting on a play for parents to come and see, but we still have to walk back to our old school hall to do it. The replacement will be ready by next year, though. We're so pleased with our new school, and our teachers say we'll all learn much faster now we're in it! 
 

","Anna's new school has been an exciting development this week, as we have moved into a building constructed entirely from wood, similar to our previous school, but it is one of the first in the country designed to be highly environmentally friendly. The construction spanned several months, allowing us to observe the process, from the initial land clearance, which eliminated some open space, to the noisy machinery that was frequently halted by heavy rain, leading us to doubt its completion. Presently, we occupy five spacious classrooms, significantly larger than those in the adjacent old school, and we share a multipurpose room with the local community for events. Additionally, the facility includes a nursery, an attractive dining area, and ample changing rooms awaiting the new sports field. Notably, the building lacks conventional heaters; instead, it utilizes heat generated by occupants and equipment, with an efficient design that retains warmth and amplifies sound, creating an acoustic environment reminiscent of a concert hall. The roof features a tree, installed as per Austrian tradition, and power is sourced from a sizable wind turbine on a nearby hill, which rotates rapidly and is visible from a distance; we documented it with photographs for our website. While the building is in use, certain elements, such as a dedicated performance hall, are still under construction, necessitating temporary use of the old school's facilities, with completion expected next year. We are delighted with the new school, and our educators anticipate enhanced learning outcomes in this improved setting.","The inauguration of Anna's new school has rendered this week exceptionally thrilling, following our relocation to a structure meticulously crafted from wood, echoing the design of our former institution, yet distinguished as one of the nation's pioneering edifices conceived with profound environmental sustainability. Over the course of months, we witnessed the construction unfold, encompassing the clearance of verdant terrain—a process that, while exhilarating, entailed the loss of open land and was punctuated by the clamor of machinery, frequently interrupted by torrential rainfall, fostering apprehensions regarding its eventual culmination. Currently, we benefit from five capacious classrooms, substantially more expansive than those in the antiquated adjacent school, complemented by a communal space utilized for municipal gatherings, a nursery, an inviting dining facility, and generously proportioned changing rooms in anticipation of the forthcoming sports field. A remarkable aspect is the absence of traditional heating systems; instead, thermal energy is derived from the collective body heat of occupants and operational devices, with the architecture adeptly conserving warmth and acoustics, thereby simulating the resonance of a concert hall during vocal exercises. The rooftop is adorned with a tree, emplaced in adherence to Austrian custom, while electrical needs are met by a formidable wind turbine situated on a proximate hill, whose rapid revolutions and considerable scale render it perceptible from miles away—an feature we captured photographically for digital dissemination. Although the building is operational, certain components, such as a dedicated theatrical venue, remain incomplete, obliging us to utilize the prior school's hall temporarily, with finalization projected for the subsequent year. Our collective satisfaction with this new environment is palpable, and pedagogical staff assert that it will catalyze accelerated academic progress.","The advent of Anna's new school has imbued this week with considerable exhilaration, as we have transitioned into an architectural marvel constructed predominantly from timber, reminiscent of our prior establishment, yet pioneering in its embodiment of ecological conscientiousness within the national context. The protracted construction, spanning numerous months, afforded us a vantage point to observe the progression from site clearance—which, albeit thrilling, resulted in the diminution of pristine open terrain—to the cacophony of machinery, incessantly impeded by deluges, thereby fostering skepticism about its eventual fruition. Presently, we are endowed with five expansive classrooms, markedly surpassing the dimensions of those in the archaic neighboring school, alongside a versatile room allocated for communal assemblies, a nursery, an aesthetically pleasing refectory, and commodious changing facilities poised for utilization upon the completion of the athletic field. A distinctive characteristic is the eschewal of conventional heating apparatuses; rather, thermal regulation is achieved through the amalgamated warmth emitted by occupants and electronic equipment, with the edifice's design proficiently entrapping heat and amplifying auditory phenomena, evoking an ambience analogous to that of a concert auditorium during melodic endeavors. The rooftop is graced by a tree, installed in conformity with Austrian tradition, and electrical power is harnessed from an imposing wind turbine on an adjacent elevation, whose swift rotations and monumental stature render it discernible across vast distances—a spectacle we documented through photography for online curation. Notwithstanding current occupancy, certain infrastructural elements, such as a dedicated performance space, remain in abeyance, necessitating interim recourse to the antiquated school's hall, with anticipated completion in the ensuing annum. Our approbation for this novel institution is unequivocal, and educators prognosticate that it will engender a more expeditious pedagogical trajectory."

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! 
Each band had their own costumes, ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore, to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but all of us were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially considering everyone was so young. Players from each band even created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch - but even better when my band played on stage! 
We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half, in fact. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country - I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. 
Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you. 
My school's really lucky because we have great teachers, and parents who've supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music!

","I perform on the trumpet as part of my school's jazz band. Last month, we participated in a jazz competition featuring bands from various local high schools, and our ensemble emerged victorious. Each band showcased distinct attire, ranging from the black school uniforms my band adopted to vividly colored T-shirts worn by others. Although we didn't resemble professional adult bands in appearance, all of us were accustomed to competing, resulting in an impressive quality of performance, particularly given our youth. Musicians from each band even improvised new compositions live on stage, which was thrilling to observe, though I found it most rewarding when my own band performed. Our school boasts an excellent jazz band, yet admission is selective, with only about half of the applicants being accepted. Nonetheless, those eager to participate attend jazz rehearsals before school and frequently gather afterward to listen to jazz and delve into its nuances. Additionally, there are opportunities to attend jazz summer camps nationwide; I have attended a couple and gained substantial knowledge. Adults often express surprise at the growing interest in jazz among young people. According to my music teacher, this is because pop music lacks the complexity that appeals to serious music enthusiasts like myself. I am drawn to jazz because it blends innovation with tradition; it allows for personal creativity while fostering a sense of connection to the legacy of iconic jazz performers. My school is fortunate to have dedicated teachers and parents who consistently support us, without whom our musical progress would be unattainable.","As a trumpet player in my school's jazz band, I recently experienced a notable achievement when we triumphed in a jazz competition that included ensembles from neighboring high schools. The event featured a diversity of costumes, with my band opting for black school uniforms while others donned brightly colored T-shirts; although our appearance diverged from that of professional adult bands, our collective experience in competitive performances ensured a remarkably high standard of musicianship, especially considering our youth. A highlight was the on-stage improvisation of new tunes by performers from each band, which was exhilarating to witness, though I derived the greatest satisfaction from my own band's performance. Our school maintains a distinguished jazz band, yet it is highly selective, admitting only approximately half of those who aspire to join. However, dedicated students can engage in pre-school jazz practices and often convene post-school to immerse themselves in jazz, exploring its intricate language. Furthermore, national jazz summer camps are available; I have attended several, accruing significant insights. Adults frequently exhibit astonishment at the burgeoning interest in jazz among the younger generation. My music teacher posits that this stems from pop music's insufficient challenge for serious musicians like myself. I am captivated by jazz due to its dual nature as both contemporary and historical; it empowers individual artistic expression while evoking a profound connection to the heritage of legendary jazz artists. My school is exceptionally fortunate to benefit from exceptional educators and unwavering parental support, which are indispensable to our musical endeavors.","In my capacity as a trumpet instrumentalist within the school's jazz ensemble, I recently partook in a jazz competition that encompassed bands from local high schools, culminating in our band's victory. The sartorial choices varied considerably among participants, with my ensemble adhering to black school uniforms, whereas others exhibited vividly hued T-shirts; despite not emulating the aesthetic of professional adult bands, our proficiency, honed through prior competitive engagements, yielded an extraordinary caliber of performance, particularly impressive given our youthful demographics. A particularly captivating aspect was the spontaneous composition of new melodies by musicians from each band directly on stage, an experience that was intensely stimulating to observe, though my personal zenith was attained during my own band's rendition. The school prides itself on a superlative jazz band, albeit one that is highly exclusive, with admission granted to merely half of the aspirants. Nevertheless, enthusiasts may attend pre-instructional jazz rehearsals and frequently assemble post-school to engage in auditory appreciation of jazz and master its vernacular. Moreover, excursions to jazz summer camps across the nation are facilitated; my attendance at a couple has endowed me with substantial erudition. Adults often manifest incredulity regarding the ascendant interest in jazz among adolescents. My music instructor theorizes that this phenomenon arises from pop music's inadequacy in providing the requisite intellectual stimulation for earnest music aficionados such as myself. I am enthralled by jazz's synthesis of novelty and tradition; it affords the liberty for individual creative output while instilling a sense of participation in the historical continuum of eminent jazz virtuosos. My educational institution is profoundly advantaged by the presence of exemplary pedagogues and indefatigable parental advocacy, without which our musical aspirations would remain unrealized."

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well, and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. 
Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, most sharks ought to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks.

","Sharks rank among the most intimidating creatures in the oceans. They are exceptionally adapted for underwater predation, possessing keen eyesight and the ability to detect movement through specialized lateral lines on their bodies, rendering them highly perilous to smaller marine organisms that serve as their prey. Although sharks share several characteristics with other fish, their anatomy differs significantly. For instance, unlike most fish, the majority of sharks must swim continuously to facilitate respiration and sustain life, resulting in minimal sleep. Additionally, when inverted onto their backs, sharks enter a state of immobility. This phenomenon is particularly advantageous for researchers, who frequently employ this technique to safely handle sharks and gain deeper insights into these captivating animals.","Sharks are among the most formidable predators inhabiting the world's oceans. They are superbly equipped for aquatic hunting, boasting acute visual capabilities and the faculty to perceive vibrations via specialized lateral line systems, which renders them exceedingly hazardous to diminutive marine fauna that constitute their sustenance. While sharks exhibit parallels with other fish in numerous respects, their physiological structures are distinct. For example, in contrast to many fish, most sharks are compelled to engage in perpetual swimming to enable respiration and maintain viability, thereby experiencing negligible periods of sleep. Moreover, when sharks are inverted dorsally, they can enter a state of tonic immobility. This trait is immensely beneficial for investigators, who often necessitate this approach to manage sharks securely and acquire comprehensive knowledge about these intriguing species.","Sharks epitomize some of the most fearsome entities within marine ecosystems. They are exquisitely adapted for subaquatic foraging, endowed with exceptional visual acuity and the capacity to discern movements through specialized lateral line organs, thereby posing a grave threat to smaller aquatic organisms that fall prey to them. Although sharks share affinities with other piscine species in various aspects, their corporeal frameworks diverge; for instance, unlike the majority of fish, most sharks are obligated to swim incessantly to effectuate respiration and ensure survival, consequently affording them scant opportunity for slumber. Furthermore, upon being overturned onto their dorsal surfaces, sharks may lapse into a cataleptic state. This phenomenon proves invaluable for researchers, who routinely exploit this technique to facilitate the handling of sharks and elucidate further details about these fascinating creatures."
121,"Norwich

Norwich, the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia, has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England.
With two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has long been a popular centre for various religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and has recently celebrated its 900th anniversary, while Norwich itself had a year of celebration in 1994 to mark the 800th anniversary of the city receiving a Royal Charter. This allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself independently.
Today, in comparison with places like London or Manchester, Norwich is quite small, with a population of around 150,000, but in the 16th century Norwich was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years and got richer and richer, becoming famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year.
Nowadays, there are far fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964 the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. With its fast-growing student population and its success as a modern commercial centre (Norwich is the biggest centre for insurance services outside London), the city new has a wide choice of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and a number of arts and leisure centres. There is also a football team, whose colours are green and yellow. The team is known as 'The Canaries', though nobody can be sure why.

With two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has perennially functioned as a focal point for various religious traditions; the inaugural cathedral was erected in 1095 and has lately observed its 900th anniversary, whilst the city itself marked the 800th anniversary of its Royal Charter bestowal in 1994, an event that conferred urban status and autonomous governance. In contemporary terms, Norwich is comparatively modest in scale with a populace of around 150,000, yet during the 16th century, it held the distinction of being England's secondary city. It experienced continuous expansion and enrichment over the ensuing three centuries, gaining renown for possessing as many churches as there are weeks in the annum and as many public houses as there are days. Presently, the tally of churches and pubs has diminished considerably; however, the founding of the University of East Anglia in 1964 has invigorated the locale. Augmented by a swiftly growing student demographic and its success as a modern commercial nexus, particularly in insurance services where it is the preeminent centre outside London, Norwich now proffers an extensive selection of entertainments: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, bustling cafes, superlative restaurants, and numerous arts and leisure facilities. The city is also home to a football team colloquially termed 'The Canaries', whose kit is green and yellow, though the etymology of the moniker remains obscure. A recent enhancement to the city's allure is 'The Castle Mall', a contemporary shopping complex. Its realization necessitated a protracted excavation over two years, during which lorries displaced nearly a million tons of earth to facilitate the creation of a rooftop park replete with ornamental water features and arboreal plantings. The citizenry expresses particular satisfaction that the antiquated open market endures in the urban core, adjacent to the new development, and both domains continue to prosper, evidencing Norwich's adept synthesis of historical and modern attributes.","Norwich, the capital of the region known as East Anglia in Britain, has sustained human habitation for in excess of two thousand years, commencing as a minor village proximate to the River Wensum. By the epoch of the Norman incursion in 1066, it had evolved into one of the most populous towns in England. Possessing two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has historically served as a significant centre for multifarious religious observances; the primary cathedral was constructed in 1095 and has recently celebrated its noningentenary, while the municipality itself commemorated the octocentenary of its receipt of a Royal Charter in 1994, an instrument that legitimized its designation as a city and endowed it with self-regulatory prerogatives. In contemporary comparison to metropolises such as London or Manchester, Norwich is relatively diminutive, with a population approximating 150,000, yet during the sixteenth century, it was esteemed as England's second city. It underwent sustained growth and accrual of wealth over the subsequent trecentenary, achieving fame for harbouring as many ecclesiastical edifices as there are weeks in the year and as many taverns as there are diurnal intervals. In the present day, the proliferation of churches and pubs has substantially abated; notwithstanding, the establishment of the University of East Anglia in 1964 has infused vitality. Bolstered by an expeditiously expanding scholastic cohort and its eminence as a modern commercial hub, notably as the paramount centre for insurance services external to London, the city now affords a panoply of diversions: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, vibrant cafes, exquisite restaurants, and a multiplicity of arts and leisure centres. Additionally, there exists a football contingent, denominated 'The Canaries' and attired in verdant and aureate hues, albeit the derivation of this appellation remains indeterminate. A further augmentation to the city's attractions is 'The Castle Mall', a sophisticated retail complex. Its realization entailed an extensive excavation persisting for over two years, wherein lorries conveyed nearly a million tons of substratum to enable the transformation of the mall's roof into an urban park, embellished with aesthetically pleasing aquatic features and a copse of trees. The indigenous populace evinces genuine approbation that the archaic open market persists in the cardinal locus of the city, contiguous to the novel development, and both sectors perpetuate robust commercial activity, substantiating Norwich's proficiency in amalgamating the quintessence of the antiquated and the innovative."

","Upon opening the first Body Shop in 1976, my sole objective was to generate sufficient income to support my children. Presently, The Body Shop has evolved into a global enterprise experiencing rapid expansion worldwide. Over the years since its inception, I have acquired substantial knowledge, much of which is encapsulated in this book, as I contend that our company possesses valuable insights on operating a prosperous business while adhering to our fundamental principles. This publication diverges from conventional business literature and transcends mere autobiography. Its central thesis is that business success necessitates distinctiveness; commerce can be enjoyable, conducted with affection, and contribute positively to society. In both professional and personal spheres, I require enjoyment, a familial atmosphere, and stimulation from unforeseen events. I have perpetually aspired for The Body Shop staff to share these sentiments. This book now disseminates my concepts publicly, and I envision boundless potential for our collective family and accomplishments. I regard this prospect as exhilarating and trust you will concur.","When I inaugurated the inaugural Body Shop in 1976, my exclusive aim was to procure adequate earnings to sustain my offspring. In the contemporary context, The Body Shop stands as an international corporation undergoing swift global proliferation. Throughout the intervening years since our commencement, I have assimilated a considerable corpus of knowledge, a significant portion of which is delineated in this volume, for I maintain that our enterprise proffers instructive perspectives on cultivating a thriving business without compromising our deeply held convictions. This tome eschews the conventions of standard business manuals and extends beyond a mere personal narrative. Its fundamental assertion is that entrepreneurial triumph mandates differentiation; business endeavors can be pleasurable, administered with compassion, and effectuate benevolent outcomes. In the realms of commerce and existence, I necessitate personal fulfillment, a cohesive communal dynamic, and invigoration from serendipitous occurrences. I have invariably endeavored to instill analogous dispositions among The Body Shop personnel. Presently, this treatise propagates my ideologies into the public domain, and I conceive of an unbounded scope for our familial collective and its feasible undertakings. I deem this notion profoundly stimulating and anticipate that you will similarly find it so.","At the inception of the first Body Shop establishment in 1976, my singular ambition was to amass the requisite financial resources to provide for my children's sustenance. In the present day, The Body Shop has metamorphosed into a transnational entity characterized by accelerated growth across the globe. During the epoch since our foundation, I have accrued an extensive repository of erudition, a substantial segment of which is expounded within this compendium, as I posit that our organization embodies salient tenets on orchestrating a flourishing enterprise whilst preserving our intrinsic ideological commitments. This work defies categorization as a prototypical business treatise and transcends the confines of autobiographical exposition. Its cardinal proposition is that commercial ascendancy imperatively demands distinctiveness; entrepreneurial pursuits can be inherently gratifying, governed by altruistic principles, and instrumental in effecting salutary transformations. Within both professional and existential domains, I require hedonistic engagement, a simulacrum of kinship, and intellectual arousal from fortuitous developments. I have perennially aspired to cultivate commensurate sensibilities among the cadre of The Body Shop employees. This volume now disseminates my conceptual frameworks into the public sphere, and I envisage a limitless purview for our consanguineous collective and its attainable endeavors. I regard this conception as profoundly invigorating and trust that you will evince a congruent response."

In bygone eras, thirty passenger trains quotidienly set forth from Vancouver upon the transcontinental railway; contemporaneously, merely three weekly departures occur, yet the peregrination endures as a superlative adventure. Nocturnal repose is undertaken on board, an enjoyable facet, though transit through some of the most magnificent panoramas is effected during nocturnal hours."
124,"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The sons are composers and prize-winning musicians, while Dad makes the instruments. Matthew Rye reports.
Whole families of musicians are not exactly rare. However, it is unusual to come across one that includes not only writers and performers of music, but also an instrument maker.
When South Wales schoolteachers John and Hetty Watkins needed to get their ten-year-old son, Paul, a cello to suit his blossoming talents, they baulked at the costs involved. 'We had a look at various dealers and it was obvious it was going to be very expensive,' John says.
'So I wondered if I could actually make one. I discovered that the Welsh School of Instrument Making was not far from where I lived, and I went along for evening classes once a week for about three years.'
'After probably three or four goes with violins and violas, he had a crack at his first cello,' Paul, now 28, adds. 'It turned out really well. He made me another one a bit later, when he'd got the hang of it. And that's the one I used right up until a few months ago.' John has since retired as a teacher to work as a full-time craftsman, and makes up to a dozen violins a year - selling one to the esteemed American player Jaime Laredo was 'the icing on the cake'. Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from an early age. The piano came first: 'As soon as I was big enough to climb up and bang the keys, that's what I did,' Paul remembers. But it wasn't long before the cello beckoned. 'My folks were really quite keen for me to take up the violin, because Dad, who played the viola, used to play chamber music with his mates and they needed another violin to make up a string trio.
I learned it for about six weeks but didn't take to it. But I really took to the character who played the cello in Dad's group. I thought he was a very cool guy when I was six or seven. So he said he'd give me some lessons, and that really started it all off. Later, they suggested that my brother play the violin too, but he would have none of it.'
'My parents were both supportive and relaxed,' Huw says. 'I don't think I would have responded very well to being pushed. And, rather than feeling threatened by Paul's success, I found that I had something to aspire to.' Now 22, he is beginning to make his own mark as a pianist and composer.
Meanwhile, John Watkins' cello has done his elder son proud. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. Then, at the remarkably youthful age of 20, he was appointed principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held, still playing his father's instrument, until last year. Now, however, he has acquired a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 'Dad's not said anything about me moving on, though recently he had the chance to run a bow across the strings of each in turn and had to admit that my new one is quite nice! I think the only thing Dad's doesn't have - and may acquire after about 50-100 years - is the power to project right to the back of large concert halls. It will get richer with age, like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.' 
Soon he will be seen on television playing the Rugeri as the soloist in Elgar's Cello Concerto, which forms the heart of the second programme in the new series, Masterworks. 'The well-known performance history doesn't affect the way I play the work,' he says. 'I'm always going to do it my way.' But Paul won't be able to watch himself on television - the same night he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival. Nor will Huw,whose String Quartet is receiving its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall the same evening. John and Hetty will have to be diplomatic - and energetic - if they are to keep track of all their sons' musical activities over the coming weeks.",B2,This is about the Watkins family. The father makes musical instruments. The two sons are musicians. Paul plays the cello. Huw plays the piano and writes music. The father made a cello for Paul. Paul used it for many years. Now Paul has a new cello. Both sons are successful. The parents are happy and support their sons.,"The Watkins family is very musical. John, the father, makes violins and cellos. He started making instruments because buying one was too expensive. His sons, Paul and Huw, are musicians. Paul is a cellist who won awards and played in an orchestra. Huw is a pianist and composer. The parents encouraged them but did not push them. Paul now uses a new cello, but his father's cello was very good. Both sons have important music events soon.","The Watkins family is unique because John, the father, creates instruments, while his sons, Paul and Huw, are accomplished musicians. John began making cellos after finding commercial options too costly, learning through evening classes. Paul used his father's cello for years, achieving success like winning the BBC Young Musician competition and becoming principal cellist. Now, he uses an older cello on loan. Huw, inspired by his brother, is building a career as a pianist and composer. Their parents supported them without pressure. Soon, both sons have significant performances, making it busy for the family.","Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

John's foray into lutherie was driven by the prohibitive cost of acquiring a cello for Paul, leading him to attend the Welsh School of Instrument Making. Paul utilized his father's handmade cello to attain notable achievements, including victory in the BBC Young Musician of the Year and a principal cellist role, though he has since transitioned to a historic Francesco Rugeri cello. Huw, finding motivation in Paul's accomplishments, is establishing himself as a pianist and composer. The parents fostered a supportive yet non-coercive environment. Imminently, both sons are engaged in high-profile musical engagements, necessitating parental diplomacy to oversee their activities.","The Watkins family constitutes an extraordinary ensemble in the musical realm, distinguished by John's craftsmanship in instrument making and his sons' prowess as composers and laureate musicians. John's initiation into lutherie was precipitated by the exorbitant expense of procuring a cello for Paul, prompting him to enroll in evening classes at the Welsh School of Instrument Making. Paul's career was propelled by his father's artisan cello, culminating in triumphs such as the BBC Young Musician of the Year string final and his appointment as principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra; he has since adopted a Francesco Rugeri cello, noting its superior projection in vast auditoriums. Huw, eschewing any sense of rivalry, draws aspiration from Paul's successes and is forging his own legacy as a pianist and composer. The parental approach was characterized by encouragement without imposition. Forthcoming, Paul and Huw are concurrently featured in prestigious performances, obliging John and Hetty to adeptly navigate their sons' burgeoning schedules."

We always went to Ireland in June. Ever since the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have had to add to the building, but everything has been done most discreetly.
It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He'd come across an advertisement in the days when the Malseeds still felt the need to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel that had been recommended by friends, but it hadn't been a success because the food was so appalling.
The four of us have been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. They call me Milly, though strictly speaking my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good, I suppose. He and Strafe were at school together, which must be why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think.
'How ve1y nice,' Mrs Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. Some instinct seems to tell her when guests are about to arrive, for she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she commanded the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs Malseed herself painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.
'Well, well, well,' Mr Malseed said, now entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish manner. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us think we were rather more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, causing eve1yone in the hall to laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, canying as much of our luggage as he could manage and returning for the remainder.
After dinner we played cards for a while but not going on for as long as we might because we were still quite tired after the journey. In the lounge there was a man on his own and a French couple. There had been other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window we could see some of them strolling about the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere.
I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.",B2,"We always go to Ireland in June. We go to a big house by the sea.

It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He'd come across an advertisement in the days when the Malseeds still felt the need to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel that had been recommended by friends, but it hadn't been a success because the food was so appalling.
The four of us have been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. They call me Milly, though strictly speaking my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good, I suppose. He and Strafe were at school together, which must be why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think.
'How ve1y nice,' Mrs Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. Some instinct seems to tell her when guests are about to arrive, for she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she commanded the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs Malseed herself painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.
'Well, well, well,' Mr Malseed said, now entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish manner. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us think we were rather more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, causing eve1yone in the hall to laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, canying as much of our luggage as he could manage and returning for the remainder.
After dinner we played cards for a while but not going on for as long as we might because we were still quite tired after the journey. In the lounge there was a man on his own and a French couple. There had been other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window we could see some of them strolling about the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere.
I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed. Since first we came here, we'd all fallen hopelessly in love with every variation of its remarkable landscape.","We invariably journey to Ireland each June, having established a tradition of spending the initial fortnight at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim ever since we commenced our collective holidays. This substantial seaside residence, situated proximate to the village of Ardbeag, was discreetly extended by its English proprietors, the Malseeds. Strafe originally identified Glencorn through an advertisement from the era when the Malseeds still utilized promotional means. Our quartet—comprising Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and myself, referred to as Milly—has engaged in card games for an extensive period. Notably, we reside in proximity to the Malseeds' former English hometown, a coincidence we often remark upon. Upon our arrival, Mrs. Malseed extended a cordial welcome, instinctively anticipating guests and allocating rooms adorned with floral appellations she personally painted. Mr. Malseed effusively greeted us in the customary Irish manner, his geniality fostering a sense of distinct appreciation. Post-dinner, we engaged in a brief card session, fatigued from travel, while observing other patrons ambulating the lawns or traversing the cliff path. Our established pattern entails morning perambulations to Ardbeag for coffee, returning for luncheon, and afternoon excursions by automobile, as we have developed an profound affection for the region's diverse and striking scenery over time.","We have perpetually sojourned in Ireland during June, consistently dedicating the inaugural fortnight to Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim since the inception of our collective holiday excursions. This expansive maritime edifice, adjacent to Ardbeag, was acquired by the English couple, the Malseeds, who have implemented subtle architectural augmentations. Strafe serendipitously discovered the establishment via an advertisement from the period when the Malseeds still deemed promotional efforts necessary. Our assembly—Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and I, known colloquially as Milly—has sustained a protracted tradition of card games. Intriguingly, we all inhabit locales near the Malseeds' previous domicile in England, a fortuity we frequently contemplate. Upon our advent, Mrs. Malseed proffered an effusive welcome, her intuitive discernment of guest arrivals evident as she assigned accommodations bearing floral nomenclature that she herself had artistically rendered. Mr. Malseed, entering from the kitchen, extended a heartfelt Irish salutation, his vibrant demeanor imbuing us with a sentiment of singular regard. Following the evening repast, we indulged in a truncated card session, our vigor diminished by the journey, whilst observing solitary and French patrons; the lodge, replete in June, featured guests meandering the grounds. Our habitual itinerary encompasses matutinal strolls along the sands to Ardbeag for coffee, a return for luncheon, and vespertine vehicular explorations, as we have cultivated an indelible captivation with the multifarious and sublime topography over successive visits."
126,"IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT

What keeps film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their home comforts for months on end? The search for the perfect shot.
Of all the creatures to be found in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to track down must surely be producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman.
Their present habitat, the Ngorongoro Crater, has been lashed by six months of almost continuous rain, rise to a number of unforeseen problems. Newman explained that they had to invest in an expensive piece of equipment so that whenever one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. His working partnership with the talented producer has created some of TV's finest wildlife films, such as their amazing and well-received film on leopards.
Even while this film of one of Africa's shyest cats was being shown, the pair were already back where they belong - this time trailing that equally shy animal, the jackal. But this is nothing unusual in television partnerships. Travelling film-makers have been constantly circling the globe, in order to point cameras at exotic wildlife ever since the birth of television.
I spoke to Newman about their partnership while he was making one of his rare and unpredictable reunions with other members of the human race at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we tend to get over them fairly quickly,' he says of his colleague. Neither of them regard themselves as the leader, and he says that one of the reasons why they get on so well with each other is that they both see the animals in a similar way.
'When we are on the move, we have to put up our tents each night. But this time we are operating much more of a fixed camp, and as we set out at 5 a.m. each morning, we tend to make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.'
The rest of the Newman-Barrett daily diet consists of pre-packed meals heated and dished out by whoever is at hand at the time. 'It's not unusual for us to be out and about for up to eight weeks at a time, so catering does cause the odd panic,' says Newman.
It can be a rough existence, but the appeal of being alone in such remote areas is that we can get close enough to the animals to become part of their lives. I remember once we were filming a family of lions and there was one lioness who would regularly go off on her own. Whenever she returned, she would go round and greet all the other members of the pride, and after a while she made a point of greeting our car as part of her round.'
It was back in 1988 that Newman first worked with Barrett on a film called 'The Great Rift', and two more years before they set off as a team to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to set aside four months on location to gather sufficient material for each half-hour film. And before they get the green light, they have to submit a script for approval.
'Amanda and I struck up a good working relationship from the start,' says Newman, 'because it was obvious that we shared the same ideas and overall vision. What we are always seeking to achieve is a film that is rich in atmosphere, that brings to life the true spirit of the place and animals, and that will touch people's hearts. I believe if you can evoke an emotional response from people, that is far better than if you appeal only to their heads.'
",B2,Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman make films about animals. They are in Africa. They look for animals to film. They work together. They have a car. Sometimes the car gets stuck in mud. They use a tool to pull the car out. They make films about leopards and jackals. They travel a lot. They sleep in tents. They eat food from packages. They like being close to animals. They started working together in 1988. They want their films to make people feel something.,"Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman are film-makers who make wildlife films. They spend months in places like East Africa to find animals to film. In the Ngorongoro Crater, there was a lot of rain, which caused problems. They bought special equipment to pull their car out of the mud when it gets stuck. They have made popular films, such as one about leopards. Now they are filming jackals. They travel around the world for their work. They sometimes argue but quickly make up. They share ideas and both see animals in a similar way. They set up camp, make tea early, and eat pre-packed meals. They enjoy being in remote areas to get close to animals. They started working together in 1988 and need four months to make each film. They want their films to touch people's hearts.","Film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman often leave home for months to search for the perfect wildlife shot. In East Africa, they are hard to find, just like the animals they film. Currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, heavy rain has caused issues, so they invested in equipment to rescue their vehicles from mud. Their partnership has produced excellent TV films, like the one on leopards, and they are now filming jackals. This is common for TV teams who travel globally. Newman mentioned they have occasional arguments but resolve them quickly, and neither acts as the leader because they share similar views on animals. They use a fixed camp, prepare tea in advance, and rely on pre-packed meals during long trips. Living roughly in remote areas allows them to get close to animals, as when a lioness greeted their car. They began working together in 1988 and now spend four months on location per film, submitting scripts for approval first. Their goal is to create atmospheric films that evoke emotional responses.","IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT

","Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman, dedicated film-makers, frequently forsake domestic comforts for extended periods in pursuit of the ideal wildlife footage. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, they are among the most elusive figures, currently operating in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has endured six months of relentless rainfall, precipitating unforeseen challenges. To mitigate vehicle entrapment in mud, they procured costly equipment for mutual extraction. Their collaborative efforts have yielded acclaimed television productions, such as the remarkable film on leopards, and they have since transitioned to documenting the equally reclusive jackal. This nomadic existence is characteristic of television partnerships, with crews perpetually traversing the globe to capture exotic fauna. During a rare respite at a safari lodge, Newman reflected on their dynamic, noting sporadic disputes that are swiftly overcome, with neither assuming leadership due to a shared perspective on wildlife. Employing a fixed camp strategy, they pre-prepare tea and depend on pre-packaged sustenance during protracted expeditions. The rugged lifestyle affords intimate animal interactions, exemplified by a lioness incorporating their vehicle into her greetings. Their association commenced in 1988 with 'The Great Rift', evolving into a dedicated team for projects like Arctic foxes, necessitating four-month field commitments per half-hour film, preceded by script approvals. They aspire to craft films imbued with atmosphere that resonate emotionally with audiences.","What compels film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman to relinquish home comforts for months on end is their relentless quest for the quintessential shot. Amidst the jungles and plains of East Africa, they rank among the most arduous to locate, presently inhabiting the Ngorongoro Crater, which has been subjected to six months of near-continuous deluge, giving rise to a plethora of unanticipated complications. Newman elucidated that they had to invest in an expensive apparatus to ensure that whenever a vehicle becomes mired in mud, Amanda can extricate him to safety. Their synergistic partnership has engendered some of television's most exquisite wildlife documentaries, such as their profoundly impactful and widely acclaimed film on leopards. Even as that film was being broadcast, the duo had already returned to their natural milieu—this time in pursuit of the equally elusive jackal. This peripatetic existence is emblematic of television collaborations, with film-makers incessantly circumnavigating the globe to train lenses on exotic fauna since the medium's inception. In an infrequent and unpredictable reunion with humanity at a safari lodge, Newman discoursed on their rapport, acknowledging occasional altercations that are expeditiously surmounted, with neither party asserting dominance, attributing their harmonious interaction to a congruent perception of animals. While itinerant, they erect tents nightly, but presently, they are operating a more permanent encampment, departing at dawn with tea pre-brewed and conserved in vacuum flasks. Their sustenance comprises pre-packaged repasts heated and dispensed ad hoc, with Newman conceding that protracted sojourns of up to eight weeks sporadically incite culinary anxieties. Despite the austere conditions, the allure of solitude in such remote locales enables proximate engagement with wildlife, as evinced by a lioness who routinely incorporated their vehicle into her ceremonial greetings. Their collaboration originated in 1988 with 'The Great Rift', culminating in a dedicated partnership two years later for filming Arctic foxes, thereafter institutionalizing four-month field residencies to amass sufficient footage for each thirty-minute film, contingent upon script endorsement. Newman affirmed that an efficacious working relationship was instantaneously forged due to shared ideologies and a holistic vision, perpetually striving to produce films replete with atmosphere that vivify the essence of the environment and its inhabitants, thereby eliciting profound emotional resonance in viewers."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire.
'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is such a tranquil, peaceful place - and here I was rushing around when I could be sitting quietly giving an animal a cuddle. Some of the members of the fashion team seemed quite stressed - my job doesn't really get pressurised. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, it made me laugh to think that I'd usually be cleaning out cages or handling rats. I'm fascinated to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo so I'll stay put.'
Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo.
'I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave thme a green polo shirt instead to work in -which was just as well, as I got very dirty. As I stroked one of the elephants, I reckoned Mandie would probably be packing up clothes in the cupboard. By five o'clock, I stank but I'd had such a brilliant day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants - but maybe in Africa.'
Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went on location with the television gardening programme Ground Force.

Selecting attire proved challenging, given her habitual uniform; she commenced with a still-life photo studio and press previews prior to lunch. Reflecting on the zoo's serenity juxtaposed with the frenetic pace of the magazine, she observed that certain fashion team members appeared stressed, unlike her own low-pressure role. At an afternoon fashion shoot, she found humor in the contrast to her routine duties of cage maintenance and rodent handling. While intrigued by magazine mechanics, her profound enjoyment of zoo work ensures she will remain in her position. Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, immersed herself in a day at London Zoo. Arriving clad in leather boots and dark blue trousers, she was furnished with a green polo shirt by the zoo, which proved fortuitous as she became considerably soiled. As she caressed an elephant, she surmised Mandie would be engaged in wardrobe organization. By day's end, despite emanating an odor, she recounted a splendid experience and envisioned a future involving elephants, potentially in Africa. Karen Hodson, a nurse, partook in a location shoot with the television gardening programme Ground Force. She was exceedingly exhilarated to encounter the team, with presenter Alan Titchmarsh being particularly amiable. She relished the opportunity for fresh air, a stark contrast to her hospital shifts that occasionally preclude daylight exposure. Although the labor was arduous, it was immensely enjoyable; she discovered her preconceived idyllic notion of landscaping omitted the physical exertion and meticulous planning involved. As an enthusiastic yet inefficacious gardener, she has no intention of relinquishing her nursing career. Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener from Ground Force, undertook a hospital shift. She engaged in bed-making and medication distribution, anticipating potential fainting spells but astonishing herself with her composure. She esteemed the camaraderie among nurses, finding it markedly feminine compared to her typically male-dominated milieu. She perceives her gardening role as comparatively trivial against nursing, and though the hospital day was not wholly pleasant, it imbued her with a profound sense of fulfillment. Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, assumed the role of cabin crew with Ryanair. Donning the uniform induced an immediate transformation, evoking a sense of esteem from others. Pre-flight safety briefings, including cardiac emergency protocols, aligned with her fitness expertise. During the Paris-bound flight, distributing magazines elicited self-consciousness from passenger gazes. The return leg, laden with 80 restless schoolchildren, made her yearn for the gym's controlled environment with individual clients. Sonia McDermott, a Ryanair air hostess, experienced a day as a personal trainer. Apprehensive due to her sedentary lifestyle, she was astounded by the intensive focus on a single individual, diverging from her role of interacting with numerous passengers repeatedly. At lunch, she was taken aback by trainers' less-than-optimal diets, though they consumed ample water. While disinclined to career change, the encounter motivated her to enroll in a gym and pursue a healthier regimen.","Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, embarked on a day-long immersion in the editorial environs of Marie Claire magazine. The sartorial selection posed a conundrum, diverging from her standard uniform; her itinerary encompassed a still-life photo studio and press previews antecedent to luncheon. She juxtaposed the zoo's placid ambiance with the magazine's hectic tempo, noting the apparent stress among fashion personnel, which contrasts with her own occupation's lack of pressure. During an afternoon fashion shoot, she derived amusement from the disparity with her customary responsibilities, such as sanitizing enclosures or managing rodents. While captivated by the inner workings of periodicals, her ardent affinity for zoo-keeping precludes any professional transition. Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, dedicated a day to London Zoo. She arrived attired in leather boots and navy trousers, only to be issued a green polo shirt by the zoo—a providential change given the resultant grime. As she gently stroked an elephant, she conjectured that Mandie was likely engaged in sartorial consolidation. By the day's conclusion, though malodorous, she extolled the experience as magnificent and contemplated a prospective vocation with pachyderms, possibly in an African context. Karen Hodson, a nurse, participated in an exterior filming session for the televised horticultural program Ground Force. She was profoundly exhilarated to acquaint herself with the ensemble, including the genial host Alan Titchmarsh, and cherished the exposure to open air, a rarity during her capricious hospital rotations that often obviate daylight. Notwithstanding the strenuous nature of the labor, it was exceedingly enjoyable; she discerned that her romanticized perception of landscape gardening had omitted the corporeal demands and fastidious orchestration. As a fervent but ineffectual horticulturist, she has no designs on abdicating her nursing post. Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener affiliated with Ground Force, executed a diurnal stint at Hammersmith Hospital. She undertook bed fabrication and medicament dispensation, anticipating syncope but astonishing herself with her equanimity. She esteemed the conviviality among nurses, deeming it markedly effeminate relative to her ordinary masculine milieu. She regards her landscaping profession as comparatively frivolous vis-à-vis nursing, and though the hospital interlude was not entirely agreeable, it conferred a deep-seated gratification. Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, assumed the duties of cabin crew with Ryanair. The instant she adorned the uniform, she underwent a metamorphosis, perceiving an elevation in societal regard. Pre-flight indoctrination on safety protocols, including myocardial infarction management, resonated with her athletic training. Upon passenger embarkation for Paris, distributing periodicals induced acute self-awareness under collective scrutiny. The repatriation voyage, accommodating 80 recalcitrant juveniles, incited a longing for the gym's structured setting with solitary, rational adults. Sonia McDermott, a Ryanair flight attendant, endured a day as a personal trainer. Initially trepidatious owing to her athletic inertia, she was dumbfounded by the concentrated attention bestowed upon a sole individual, a stark departure from her routine of engaging multitudes of passengers quadrifariam. At luncheon, she was nonplussed by the trainers' suboptimal nutritional choices, albeit their copious hydration. While eschewing occupational exchange, the episode galvanized her to affiliate with a gym and adopt a salubrious lifestyle."

Many trees in the Brackham area were brought down in the terrible storms that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had altered the appearance of the town centre entirely, to the annoyance of its more conservative inhabitants.
Among the annoyed, under more normal circumstances, would have been Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force. But at the height of that week's storm, when the wind brought down even the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham had in fact been in no fit state to notice. A large and healthy man, he had for the first time in his life been seriously ill with an attack of bronchitis.
When he first complained of an aching head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, had tried to persuade him to go to the doctor. Convinced that the police force could not do without him, he had, as usual, ignored her and attempted to carry on working. Predictably, though he wouldn't have listened to anyone who tried to tell him so, this had the effect of fogging his memory and shortening his temper.
It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took the initiative and drove him to the doctor's door that he finally gave in. By that time, he didn't have the strength left to argue with her. In no time at all, she was taking him along to the chemist's to get his prescribed antibiotics and then home to his unsurprised wife who sent him straight to bed.
When Molly told him, on the Thursday morning, that the walnut tree had been brought down during the night, Pelham hadn't been able to take it in. On Thursday evening, he had asked weakly about damage to the house, groaned thankfully when he heard there was none, and pulled the sheets over his head.
It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics took effect, his temperature dropped and he got up, that he realised with a shock that the loss of the walnut tree had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The Pelhams' large house stood in a sizeable garden. It had not come cheap, but even so Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The leafy garden had created an impression of privacy. Now, though, the storm had changed his outlook.
Previously, the view from the living-room had featured the handsome walnut tree. This had not darkened the room because there was also a window on the opposite wall, but it had provided interesting patterns of light and shade that disguised the true state of the worn furniture that the family had brought with them from their previous house.
With the tree gone, the room seemed cruelly bright, its worn furnishings exposed in all their shabbiness. And the view from the window didn't bear looking at. The tall house next door, previously hidden by the tree, was now there, dominating the outlook with its unattractive purple bricks and external pipes. It seemed to have a great many upstairs windows, all of them watching the Pelhams' every movement.
'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham croaked to his wife.
But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more pleased than dismayed. 'That's what I've been telling you ever since we came here. We have to buy a new sofa, whatever it costs.'",B2,"In March, big storms came to Brackham. Many trees fell down. Two big lime trees in the town square fell. The town looks different now. Some people are not happy about this. Chief Inspector Pelham is the police leader. He was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and chest pain. His wife, Molly, said he should see a doctor. But he did not listen. He tried to work. His memory was bad, and he was angry. His friend, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Then he got medicine and went home to bed. Molly told him a big walnut tree in their garden fell in the storm. He did not understand at first. Later, he saw the living room was very bright without the tree. The old furniture looked bad. Now, he could see the neighbor's big, ugly house. It had many windows. Pelham said it looked terrible. Molly said they need to buy a new sofa.","In March, terrible storms hit the Brackham area and brought down many trees. The town lost two large lime trees from the market square, changing how the town centre looks. Conservative residents were annoyed by this. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police, would normally be upset too. But during the storm, he was very ill with bronchitis and did not notice when the mature walnut tree in his garden fell. When he felt head and chest pains, his wife Molly urged him to see a doctor. He ignored her, thinking the police needed him, but this made his memory foggy and his temper short. Sergeant Lloyd took him to the doctor, and he got antibiotics. At home, Molly sent him to bed. He learned about the fallen tree later and saw that without it, the living-room was too bright, showing the worn furniture. The view now included the neighbor's tall, unattractive house with many windows. Pelham said it looked terrible, but Molly was pleased and said they must buy a new sofa.","During the severe storms in March, numerous trees in the Brackham area were brought down, including two great lime trees from the former market square.

We have to buy a new sofa, whatever it costs.'","The tempestuous storms of March wreaked havoc in the Brackham area, felling numerous trees, among which were two great lime trees from the former market square. The eradication of these prominent features fundamentally transformed the town centre's aesthetic, much to the consternation of its more conservative denizens. Ordinarily, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who heads the local police force, would have numbered among the disgruntled; however, during the storm's zenith, when the gale-force winds uprooted the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was incapacitated by a severe bronchial affliction and thus oblivious. Upon manifesting symptoms such as cephalalgia and thoracic constriction, his wife Molly endeavoured to persuade him to consult a physician, but he, assured of his indispensability to the police force, disregarded her counsel and persisted in his duties, resulting in cognitive obfuscation and exacerbated irritability. It was only through the proactive intervention of his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, who conveyed him to the medical practitioner, that he acquiesced. Subsequently, he procured prescribed antibiotics and was dispatched to his bed by his unsurprised spouse. Upon convalescing, Pelham was astounded to perceive that the walnut tree's absence had irrevocably altered the living-room's ambiance, rendering it excessively luminous and laying bare the dilapidated state of their furnishings. The prospect now encompassed the adjacent edifice, with its unsightly purple brickwork and profusion of upper-story fenestrations, which seemed to surveil their every movement. Pelham expressed his dismay at the vista, whereas Molly, evincing satisfaction, asserted the imperative of acquiring new upholstery irrespective of expense.","The cataclysmic tempests that besieged the Brackham region in March precipitated the downfall of a multitude of arboreal specimens, including two venerable lime trees that had long graced the erstwhile market square. The excision of these salient landmarks precipitated a comprehensive metamorphosis in the urban core's visage, eliciting profound disapprobation from the more traditionalist constituents of the community. Under typical circumstances, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the preeminent figure in the local constabulary, would have been numbered among the aggrieved; however, at the apogee of the meteorological tumult, when the violent zephyrs dislodged the stately walnut tree adorning his garden, Pelham was in a debilitated state, grappling with a severe bronchitic episode that rendered him insensible to the occurrence. When he initially evinced symptoms of cephalic discomfort and thoracic oppression, his spouse Molly importuned him to seek medical consultation, yet he, fortified by the conviction of his indispensability to the police apparatus, spurned her entreaties and endeavoured to sustain his professional obligations, an undertaking that inevitably engendered mnemonic clouding and a truncated temper. The impasse was resolved only when Sergeant Lloyd, his subordinate, assumed the initiative and transported him to the physician's premises, compelling his capitulation. Forthwith, he was escorted to the apothecary to procure the prescribed antibacterial agents and then repatriated to his domicile, where his wife, evincing no astonishment, consigned him directly to his bedchamber. It was not until his convalescence, facilitated by the efficacious action of the antibiotics, that Pelham apprehended with stupefaction the irrevocable alteration wrought upon the living-room's character by the walnut tree's demise: the chamber was now inundated with a harsh luminosity that laid bare the decrepitude of their furnishings. The panorama, once moderated by the tree's presence, now presented the adjacent residence in unmitigated clarity—a towering structure of aesthetically displeasing purple masonry, replete with an abundance of upper-story casements that appeared to scrutinise their every gesture. Pelham, in a hoarse utterance, decried the prospect as abominable, while Molly, positioned in the portal, articulated a sentiment more aligned with gratification than distress, positing the inexorable necessity of procuring new seating accommodations, regardless of fiscal implications."
129,"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain.

Kendra Slawinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park.
I was surprised to hear about her training venue.
'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 'I'm too involved in what I'm doing concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else,' she said.'I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.'
'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them. These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part.
'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.'
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the opening ceremony. As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.'
The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra.But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.' 
Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing.
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra.
As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.'
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned.
Doubtless she will coach young players in the future, but at the moment her eyes are firmly set on her last big event. As she leads out her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is more than likely to have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be behind her every step of the way.",B2,"Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. She is getting ready for the World Championships.

Her routine in the preceding weeks entails a day of teaching at a local school succeeded by training sessions conducted in a supermarket car park. Upon my expression of astonishment regarding the training venue, she elucidated that her intense concentration on her movements and footwork precludes her from perceiving any peculiar glances, albeit she may peripherally notice vehicles decelerating. Her current existence is wholly dedicated to attaining peak condition for the Championships, governed by a rigorous schedule designed to optimize fitness. This event constitutes her fourth World Championships, unequivocally slated to be the most expansive to date, with twenty-seven nations contending. She emphasizes the uniqueness of home support, which is instrumental in elevating netball's stature domestically, yet it concomitantly imposes heightened expectations and pressure for a commendable inaugural performance. Their initial match against Barbados follows the opening ceremony; historically, England has prevailed, yet Barbados presents an exhilarating challenge endowed with substantial prowess. England holds the fourth global ranking, but Kendra underscores the arduous nature of the Championships, necessitating daily exertion without inter-game respite, in contrast to series formats where an initial defeat does not preclude overall victory. Throughout her fifteen-year tenure at the elite level, the sport has evolved to be more demanding and rapid, characterized by heightened on-court aggression. Kendra asserts that training is intrinsically aimed at victory, yet post-match, a transformation occurs, fostering amicability among players. Netball has adopted a profoundly scientific methodology for fitness assessment, and Kendra deems it imperative for all participants to cultivate the mindset and training regimen of world-class competitors. In her capacity as captain, she prioritizes a resilient mental disposition and exemplary leadership through bolstering and motivating the squad. Her career has been meticulously orchestrated from its inception, leading to her resolution that this tournament will culminate her playing endeavors. While she is anticipated to mentor aspiring athletes subsequently, her present focus is unequivocally fixed on this culminating spectacle. As she leads her team in the candlelight ceremony, she is apt to be moved to tears, with her steadfast adherents providing unwavering support throughout.","Kendra Slawinski, who captains England's netball squad, is engrossed in the final stages of preparation for the forthcoming World Championships. In the weeks leading up to the event, her typical day comprises pedagogical duties at a local educational institution, followed by intensive training sessions held in a supermarket car park—a venue that elicited my surprise. When queried about potential onlookers' reactions, she professed that her absorption in perfecting her movements and footwork renders her oblivious to external scrutiny, though she might fleetingly observe vehicles decelerating in her peripheral vision. Her entire focus is presently channeled toward achieving optimal performance for the Championships, adhering to an exacting timetable aimed at attaining pinnacle physical conditioning. This iteration marks her fourth participation in the World Championships, which is assuredly poised to be the most monumental yet, with twenty-seven nations vying for supremacy. She accentuates the singular advantage of home support, which not only holds sentimental value but is also pivotal for augmenting netball's prestige within the nation; however, this engenders amplified pressure, as domestic spectators anticipate a strong commencement. Their inaugural contest against Barbados ensues immediately after the opening ceremony; to the best of my knowledge, England has consistently emerged victorious, yet Barbados constitutes a formidable and stimulating adversary replete with considerable talent. England is currently positioned fourth in the global rankings, but Kendra elucidates that the Championships present a formidable challenge, demanding relentless daily exertion sans inter-game recovery, unlike series competitions where an initial setback does not preclude ultimate triumph. Over her fifteen-year tenure at the zenith of the sport, netball has undergone a transformation, becoming more arduous and expeditious, with heightened aggressiveness exhibited on court. Kendra avows that the rigors of training are inextricably linked to the pursuit of victory, yet upon the final whistle, a metamorphosis occurs, fostering a more congenial demeanor among competitors. The sport has embraced a sophisticated, scientific paradigm for fitness evaluation, and Kendra contends that it is essential for all athletes to adopt the cognitive and training approaches emblematic of world-class performers. In her leadership role, she deems it crucial to embody a robust mental fortitude and to exemplify leadership through unwavering support and encouragement of her teammates. Her netball career has been assiduously plotted from its inception, culminating in her deliberate decision to conclude her playing days with this competition. Although she will indubitably transition to coaching nascent players in the future, her immediate attention is unequivocally concentrated on this valedictory major event. As she marshals her team during the opening candlelight ceremony, she is highly probable to be overcome with emotion, perhaps shedding a tear, while her devoted supporters remain steadfastly behind her throughout the journey."

Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion.
Ned Ingham: Dress Designer
Ned Ingham makes dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional, rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles,' he explains. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes. But you do not have to be a bride to own an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses, given a fresh touch by up-to-the-minute colours and fabrics. For the less adventurous, Ingham's designs include a classic summer navy-blue suit, the centrepiece of the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century. But in his hands, it looks as new as tomorrow.
Sally Quail: Jeweller
Although she once worked for an art dealer, Sally Quail has had no formal training in jewellery. It was only when she could not find an engagement ring she liked that she decided to design her own. The resulting enquiries encouraged her to set up as a designer in 1990. Now her pieces are sought out by many stars of stage and screen. Her signature style is large semi-precious stones set in gold to make magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings fashioned after those worn in the 18th century. However, she has recently begun to use the most precious stone of all - diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36- year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond and that is when I began working with them.'
Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer
Just four years after setting up in the fiercely competitive fashion business, Lily Grimson, with only an introductory course in art and design behind her, has had two of her creations selected for a major design exhibition. Whatever the shape and form of her designs, they are never ignored. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK.
The Grimson handbag is not simply a container - the bags are full of glamour, whether fashioned from the finest calfskin or the heaviest silk. A combination of chic and care makes a Grimson bag something special.
Peter Little: Hairdresser
For over 20 years, Peter Little has taken his scissors to some of the world's top heads. Everyone who is anyone has had their hair styled by this man. 'Most women want real-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. So his approach is a novel one - to ensure that his clients never appear as if they have just walked out of a salon. But this carefree attitude and casual look does not come cheap - PS250 for the first appointment, and there's a three-month waiting list. Trading on his celebrity, Peter has produced his own range of hairdryers and other styling equipment. Now, those who can't make it to his salon can create their own styles back at home.
Penny Pratt: Florist
In addition to running her tiny shop, Penny Pratt is a flower consultant for a large chain of supermarkets and provides floral ideas to a number of top restaurants. All of this is good going for someone who has no floristry qualifications and gave up her job as a teacher 10 years ago in order to do 'something different'. And her simple, yet incredibly modern, creations have begun to capture every design prize in the flower business, which has helped her in setting up her own London Flower School. She has recently combined her skills on extremely successful lecture trips to Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are much simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong and don't have too many leaves - they are too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, whatever your arrangements, the golden rule remains: the flowers must be of the same species.'

Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion.
Ned Ingham: Dress Designer
Ned Ingham makes dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional, rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles,' he explains. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes. But you do not have to be a bride to own an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses, given a fresh touch by up-to-the-minute colours and fabrics. For the less adventurous, Ingham's designs include a classic summer navy-blue suit, the centrepiece of the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century. But in his hands, it looks as new as tomorrow.
Sally Quail: Jeweller
Although she once worked for an art dealer, Sally Quail has had no formal training in jewellery. It was only when she could not find an engagement ring she liked that she decided to design her own. The resulting enquiries encouraged her to set up as a designer in 1990. Now her pieces are sought out by many stars of stage and screen. Her signature style is large semi-precious stones set in gold to make magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings fashioned after those worn in the 18th century. However, she has recently begun to use the most precious stone of all - diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36- year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond and that is when I began working with them.'
Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer
Just four years after setting up in the fiercely competitive fashion business, Lily Grimson, with only an introductory course in art and design behind her, has had two of her creations selected for a major design exhibition. Whatever the shape and form of her designs, they are never ignored. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK.
The Grimson handbag is not simply a container - the bags are full of glamour, whether fashioned from the finest calfskin or the heaviest silk. A combination of chic and care makes a Grimson bag something special.
Peter Little: Hairdresser
For over 20 years, Peter Little has taken his scissors to some of the world's top heads. Everyone who is anyone has had their hair styled by this man. 'Most women want real-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. So his approach is a novel one - to ensure that his clients never appear as if they have just walked out of a salon. But this carefree attitude and casual look does not come cheap - PS250 for the first appointment, and there's a three-month waiting list. Trading on his celebrity, Peter has produced his own range of hairdryers and other styling equipment. Now, those who can't make it to his salon can create their own styles back at home.
Penny Pratt: Florist
In addition to running her tiny shop, Penny Pratt is a flower consultant for a large chain of supermarkets and provides floral ideas to a number of top restaurants. All of this is good going for someone who has no floristry qualifications and gave up her job as a teacher 10 years ago in order to do 'something different'. And her simple, yet incredibly modern, creations have begun to capture every design prize in the flower business, which has helped her in setting up her own London Flower School. She has recently combined her skills on extremely successful lecture trips to Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are much simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong and don't have too many leaves - they are too large and architectural. For wedding bouquets, whatever your arrangements, the golden rule remains: the flowers must be of the same species.'
","Style permeates every facet of contemporary existence, from apparel to interior adornments and accessories. Jo Foley provides a glimpse into the prevailing trends for this year's fashion enthusiasts. Ned Ingham, a dress designer, crafts ethereal, romantic wedding gowns, advocating for the avoidance of conventional, rigid dresses and frilly aesthetics in favor of more minimalist designs. His passion for design originated in his youth, and he honed his technical prowess in cutting and constructing garments at fashion school. Beyond bridal attire, Ingham produces elegant evening dresses, revitalized with avant-garde colors and textiles. For the less bold, his repertoire includes a quintessential summer navy-blue suit, reinterpreted with a modern sensibility. Sally Quail, a jeweler, eschewed formal training, embarking on her career after designing her own engagement ring and establishing her enterprise in 1990. Her creations, coveted by luminaries of stage and screen, are characterized by substantial semi-precious stones mounted in gold, echoing 18th-century opulence. Recently, she has integrated diamonds into her collections, reflecting her personal evolution. Lily Grimson, a handbag designer, has swiftly garnered acclaim in the intensely competitive fashion sector, with her innovations featured in prominent exhibitions. Her meticulously handmade bags, crafted in the UK, exude sophistication through materials such as premium calfskin or dense silk, transcending mere utility. Peter Little, a hairdresser with over twenty years of tenure, has attended to an elite clientele, espousing a philosophy of understated, manageable hairstyles that eschew the salon-fresh appearance. His services command premium fees, and he has diversified into a proprietary line of hairdryers and styling apparatus. Penny Pratt, a florist, manages a boutique establishment while consulting for major supermarket chains and upscale restaurants. Despite her lack of formal floristry credentials, her simplistic yet profoundly modern arrangements have garnered industry accolades, facilitating the inception of her London Flower School. She has extended her influence through international lectures, emphasizing streamlined floral compositions with sparse foliage and homogeneous flower varieties for nuptial bouquets.","Style profoundly informs all dimensions of modern life, encompassing sartorial choices, interior decoration, and accessory selection. Jo Foley proffers a curated sampling of the sartorial vogues for this annum's fashion adherents. Ned Ingham, a purveyor of nuptial attire, fabricates diaphanous, romantic wedding dresses, exhorting patrons to eschew the orthodox, constricting gowns and ornate 'frilly' manifestations in preference for austerely elegant styles. His proclivity for design commenced during his scholastic years, and he subsequently matriculated at a fashion institution, acquiring the technical acumen requisite for sartorial construction. Ingham's oeuvre extends beyond bridal wear to encompass protracted evening dresses, imbued with contemporaneity through innovative hues and textiles. For the circumspect, his designs incorporate a classic summer navy-blue suit, a perennial staple of the Englishwoman's wardrobe, yet rendered with futuristic panache. Sally Quail, an autodidact jeweler, forsook formal pedagogy, inaugurating her vocation upon conceiving her own engagement ring and founding her atelier in 1990. Her artifacts are assiduously sought by thespians and cinematic icons, distinguished by voluminous semi-precious gemstones ensconced in aureate settings, evocative of eighteenth-century grandeur. Lately, she has commenced employing diamonds, a transition she attributes to her maturation. Lily Grimson, a handbag designer, has, within a quadrennium, secured a position in the cutthroat fashion industry, with her conceptions elected for prestigious exhibitions. Her accoutrements, meticulously handcrafted in the United Kingdom, are replete with glamour, whether wrought from exquisite calfskin or ponderous silk, amalgamating chic with fastidious craftsmanship. Peter Little, a coiffeur with a bicennial tenure, has tended to the coiffures of global eminences, promulgating a novel ethos wherein coiffures appear authentically uncontrived and amenable to domestic upkeep. This nonchalant aesthetic, however, entails exorbitant tariffs and protracted waiting periods. Capitalizing on his renown, Little has launched an eponymous range of hairdryers and coiffuring instruments. Penny Pratt, a florist, oversees a diminutive emporium while serving as a botanical consultant for expansive retail chains and gastronomic establishments. Notwithstanding her absence of formal qualifications, her unembellished yet strikingly modern floral creations have accrued every major design accolade in the floristry domain, catalyzing the establishment of her proprietary London Flower School. She has recently synergized her expertise during immensely successful peripatetic lectures in Japan and the United States, advocating for floral arrangements that are streamlined and potent, with minimal foliar elements, and adhering to the cardinal principle of species uniformity for wedding bouquets."
131,"Living in the valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.
It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills.
Soon snow began to fall. Within a day it lay some 15 centimetres deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. Up there the wind blasted fiercely. Deep in our valley we felt only sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed but the branches held firm.
And yet we knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have occurred if circumstances had been different, if the flow of water from the hills had not, many years before, been controlled, held back by a series of dams.
In a short time the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched furious clouds pile up high over the hills to the west. Sinister grey clouds extended over the valleys. They twisted and turned, rising eastwards and upwards, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which every day was becoming fuller and wilder.
The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds, but high up in the hills the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. And then it happened - for the first time in years the reservoir overflowed. There in the heights it was like the Niagara Falls, as the water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. 
The river seemed maddened as the waters poured almost horizontally down to its lower stretches. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside.
On many occasions through the centuries before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in just such a rage. Now, though, the dam restricts the flow of the river and usually all is well; the great mass of water from the hills, the product of snow and torrential rain, remains behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley, and can be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.",B2,"We lived in a valley for 16 months. Then we saw danger in the hills. Storms came early. Snow fell and was deep. It blocked our road and made paths slippery. The wind was strong on the hills. In the valley, the wind was not strong. We were worried about the river. The river is called Ryburn. It was usually calm, but now it was big and wild. Snow melted and rain came. The reservoir in the hills filled up. It overflowed like a big waterfall. The river near our house was very deep and fast. We hoped it would not flood. The dam stopped the water. The water went down. Before the dam, the river flooded villages. Now the dam keeps us safe. We feel safe in our home.","We had been living in our valley for 16 months when we first noticed dangers in the hills. Storms arrived early, before winter. Snow fell and covered the ground, blocking our lane and making paths dangerous. On the hills, the snow was deeper and the wind was very strong. In the valley, we only felt gusts of wind. We were worried, not about the snow, but about the river Ryburn. Normally it flowed gently, but now it threatened us. The snow melted, and heavy rain came from dark clouds. The reservoir in the hills filled up and overflowed, like a waterfall. The river became wild and deep near our cottage. We prayed it would not flood, and the dam held the water back. In the past, the river flooded villages, but now the dam controls it. We feel safe and can enjoy the powerful river.","After living in the valley for sixteen months, we first became aware of the dangers in the surrounding hills. Early storms brought snow that was 15 centimetres deep, blocking our lane and making paths slippery. On the higher ground, the snow was deeper and the wind blasted fiercely, while in the valley we only experienced sudden gusts. Although the snow and wind were inconvenient, our main concern was the river Ryburn, which normally flowed gently but now posed a threat. As snow melted and rain poured from ominous clouds, the reservoir filled and overflowed, creating a waterfall effect. The river surged wildly near our home, but the dam prevented flooding. Historically, the river had flooded villages, but now the dam restricts its flow, allowing us to feel secure and appreciate the river's power.","Living in the valley

Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.","Having resided in the valley for sixteen months, we initially discerned the perils inherent in the encircling hills. Premature storms deposited snow approximately 15 centimetres deep, obstructing our lane and rendering the streamside path hazardous. On the adjacent elevations, the snow accumulated more profoundly and persisted, with fierce winds blasting, whereas in the valley depths, we encountered merely sporadic gusts. While the snow and wind were inconvenient, our principal apprehension centred on the river Ryburn, typically placid but now menacing. Subsequent snowmelt and torrential rains from foreboding clouds caused the reservoir to reach capacity and overflow spectacularly, akin to Niagara Falls. The river raged violently near our dwelling, yet the dam contained the deluge. In prior centuries, the river had inundated villages in similar frenzies, but contemporary dam regulation mitigates such risks, enabling us to reside securely and marvel at the river's formidable force.","Subsequent to sixteen months of habitation in the valley, we first apprehended the latent hazards of the encompassing hills. Antedating winter, early tempests precipitated snow accumulations of some 15 centimetres, substantially impeding our lane and exacerbating the peril of the streamside path. On the neighbouring heights, the snow was considerably deeper and more enduring, subjected to ferocious wind blasts, whilst in the valley's depths, we experienced only abrupt gusts that swayed trees without compromising branches. Notwithstanding the inconveniences of snow and wind, our paramount disquietude pertained to the river Ryburn, customarily gentle yet now ominously threatening. As snow dissipated and copious rains emanated from sinister, convoluted clouds, the reservoir swelled precipitously, culminating in an overflow reminiscent of Niagara Falls. The river, maddened by the surging waters, raged proximate to our cottage, but the dam's integrity precluded inundation. Historically, the river had repeatedly flooded adjacent villages in analogous rages; however, the dam's regulatory function now curtails such episodes, permitting us to dwell in security and derive awe from the river's tremendous puissance."
132,"Confident people what's their secret?

Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it.

A Jenny

When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course.
There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place.

B Michaela

It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself.
If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears!

C Lisa

People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. Interviewing people has helped me realise that most - if not all - of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we speak to someone who's genuinely friendly. The best ever piece of advice came from my mother when I was agonising as a teenager about wearing the right clothes. She simply cried, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too busy worrying about how they look.' I've found that's well worth remembering.
I also think you gain confidence by tackling things that scare you. When I took my driving test I was so nervous, but I passed. After that I felt sure that I'd never feel so frightened again, and I never have.

D Barbara

My confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work I do, but it's something that I've built up over the years. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round. I work hard and I'm popular in the restaurant, but it's probable that one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that affect me. You've got to like yourself for what you are, not try to be what others expect.
My company runs a lot of training courses, and going on those has built up my self-esteem. The company also encourages employees to set manageable targets. It helps no end if you can see you're achieving something tangible, rather than reaching for the stars all at once, and ending up with nothing but air!

E Kim

After I left college I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing with what was being said, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I summoned up the confidence to start making my point. Even so, when I first worked in politics, I'd never spoken in public before and always used to shake like a leaf. I would say to myself, 'Don't be so silly. People do this every day of their lives, so there's no reason why you can't.' I also found it helpful to jot a few things down to refer to - rather like having a comfort blanket!

I would say to myself, 'Don't be so silly. People do this every day of their lives, so there's no reason why you can't.' I also found it helpful to jot a few things down to refer to - rather like having a comfort blanket!
I don't think there is anyone who isn't a little shaky when it comes to talking publicly. The real secret of confidence lies in telling yourself over and over again, 'Nothing is impossible.'","Confident individuals often appear as if they were inherently self-assured, yet the majority will attest that it is a skill they cultivated out of necessity. Nina Hathway inquires of five people how they accomplished this.

A Jenny: Upon leaving school, I was exceedingly shy and presumed I would remain so indefinitely. At approximately twenty-five, I was solicited to assist at my daughter's school. Convinced I would not manage, I astonished myself by performing admirably, prompting a suggestion that I undertake a university course. On the day of my inaugural lecture, I experienced profound anxiety, but my confidence incrementally expanded, rendering me more extroverted. In retrospect, my involvement at the school constituted the pivotal moment that facilitated the coherent alignment of other life aspects.

B Michaela: The inception occurred four years prior when my father fell ill, necessitating my assumption of the family enterprise. So apprehensive was I that I exhibited excessive aggression and impatience, erroneously equating such behavior with confidence. Over time, I discerned that genuine self-assurance stems from self-belief. When professional demands become overwhelming, I refrain from self-reproach by deferring certain tasks. Confronted with challenges, I affirm that I have nothing to forfeit. It is trepidation that engenders a confidence deficit, thus I engage in internal dialogues to dispel such fears.

C Lisa: Although perceived as highly confident, the more composed my demeanor, the more profound my terror. I was compelled to cultivate a confident appearance, as it is indispensable in television. Conducting interviews has elucidated that the vast majority, if not all, experience tension in critical circumstances and derive solace from interacting with authentically amiable individuals. The most invaluable counsel originated from my mother during my adolescent preoccupation with sartorial choices; she exclaimed, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too absorbed in their own appearance concerns.' I deem this maxim eminently memorable. Furthermore, I bolster my confidence by confronting intimidating endeavors, such as my driving examination, which I passed despite nervousness, thereafter assuring myself of diminished fear, a conviction that has held true.

D Barbara: My confidence emanates organically from a profound enjoyment of my vocation, though it is an attribute I have assiduously developed over time. By persevering and assimilating lessons from errors, one enhances self-assurance in subsequent endeavors. I labor diligently and enjoy popularity in the restaurant, yet it is plausible that a tenth of patrons disapprove of me. I resist allowing this to impinge upon me; one must embrace one's intrinsic identity rather than conform to external anticipations. My corporation administers numerous training programs, participation in which has fortified my self-esteem. Additionally, the firm advocates the establishment of attainable objectives, which is exceedingly beneficial in perceiving tangible accomplishments, as opposed to aspiring unrealistically and achieving naught.

E Kim: Subsequent to college, I was employed as a secretary for years, frequently remaining silent in meetings despite dissent, inhibited by timidity. Ultimately, I marshaled the fortitude to articulate my perspectives. Notwithstanding, during my initial foray into politics, I had never addressed an audience and would tremble excessively. I would admonish myself, 'Do not be so absurd; individuals engage in this routinely, thus you are equally capable.' I also discovered utility in noting key points for reference, akin to a psychological security object. I contend that no one is entirely unperturbed when speaking publicly. The quintessential secret to confidence resides in incessantly reiterating to oneself, 'Nothing is impossible.'","Confident individuals might give the impression of being innately self-possessed, yet most will confide that it is a proficiency they have acquired out of exigency. Nina Hathway probes five individuals on their methodologies for achieving this.

A Jenny: Having departed from school, I was profoundly reticent and harbored the belief that this would be a permanent state. Around the age of twenty-five, I was entreated to contribute at my daughter's educational institution. Certain of my incapacity to manage, I astounded myself by excelling, which led to a recommendation that I pursue a university curriculum. On the occasion of my first lecture, I was beset by intense apprehension, but my self-assurance burgeoned progressively, culminating in a more gregarious disposition. In hindsight, my engagement at the school proved to be the catalytic juncture that enabled the harmonious integration of other life elements.

B Michaela: The genesis transpired four years ago upon my father's illness, which compelled me to assume control of the familial enterprise. So inundated with fear was I that I manifested undue aggressiveness and impatience, misconceiving these traits as hallmarks of confidence. Gradually, I apprehended that authentic confidence is predicated on self-conviction. When occupational demands become overly burdensome, I eschew self-recrimination by postponing a subset of tasks. In the face of daunting challenges, I affirm that there is nothing to be forfeited. It is dread that instigates a paucity of confidence; consequently, I perpetually engage in sotto voce self-discourses to abnegate those fears.

C Lisa: While I am regarded as exceedingly self-assured, in reality, the more placid my exterior, the more petrified I am internally. I have been obliged to hone the faculty of projecting confidence, as it is paramount in the television industry. Conducting interviews has afforded me the insight that the overwhelming majority, if not entirety, of people become anxious in pivotal situations and experience alleviation when interacting with someone who is sincerely congenial. The most superlative guidance I ever received emanated from my mother during my adolescent anguish over sartorial appropriateness; she vehemently declared, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too engrossed in fretting over their own appearance.' I have ascertained that this adage is exceedingly worthy of retention. Moreover, I augment my confidence by undertaking endeavors that intimidate me, such as my driving examination, which I surmounted despite trepidation, after which I felt convinced that I would never again experience such profound fear, a supposition that has been validated.

D Barbara: My confidence derives intrinsically from a deep-seated relish for my occupation, albeit it is a quality I have meticulously constructed over the years. By persisting and deriving edification from any missteps, one's confidence is augmented in subsequent iterations. I exert myself assiduously and am well-regarded in the restaurant, yet it is conceivable that a decile of individuals holds an unfavorable opinion of me. I preclude this from influencing me; one must cherish oneself for one's inherent attributes, not endeavor to fulfill others' expectations. My enterprise conducts a plethora of training seminars, and my attendance has substantially bolstered my self-regard. The company further incentivizes employees to establish feasible objectives, which is inestimably advantageous in discerning palpable achievements, as opposed to striving for unattainable ideals precipitously and culminating with mere vacuity.

E Kim: After concluding college, I was employed as a secretary for an extended period, frequently occupying meetings in silent dissent, too timorous to vocalize my views. Eventually, I mustered the audacity to commence articulating my standpoint. Nevertheless, during my initial tenure in politics, I had never orated publicly and would invariably tremble markedly. I would remonstrate with myself, 'Do not be so preposterous; people engage in this daily, hence there is no rationale for your incapability.' I also found it efficacious to inscribe a few annotations for consultation, analogous to a psychological comforter. I posit that no individual is entirely unflappable when addressing a public assembly. The veritable secret to confidence lies in the perpetual reaffirmation to oneself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
133,"THE SHELL ARTIST

At the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.

There are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list. For the moment though, he will stick to the skill that he has been delighted to perfect over the past ten years: making delicate and unusual objects out of shells.
'Tell me if I am boring you,' he says, as he leads me round his apartment showing me his work. There is a fine line between being a bore and being an enthusiast, but Cooke need not worry: he fits into the latter category, helped both by his charm and by the beauty of the things he makes.
He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. 'I shan't be at all bothered if people don't buy them because I have got so used to them, and to me they're adorable. I never meant to sell my work commercially. Some friends came to see me about five years ago and said, ""You must have an exhibition - people ought to see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery"".' The result was an exhibition in London, at which 70 per cent of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the enormous prices the pieces command - around PS2,000 for the ornaments an empty space above the fireplace would seem a small sacrifice for Cooke to make.
There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at PS225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists that he has nothing to do with the prices and is cheerily open about their level: he claims there is nobody else in the world who produces work like his, and, as the gallery-owner told him, 'Well, you're going to stop one day and everybody will want your pieces because there won't be any more.'
'I do wish, though,' says Cooke, 'that I'd taken this up a lot earlier, because then I would have been able to produce really wonderful things - at least the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing the best I can now, I'm more limited physically than I was when I started.' Still, the work that he has managed to produce is a long way from the common shell constructions that can be found in seaside shops. 'I have a miniature mind,' he says, and this has resulted in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.
Cooke has created his own method and uses materials as and when he finds them. He uses the cardboard sent back with laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker ('If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!') and washing-up liquid to wash the shells. 'I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,' he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, colour gradations and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.
Cooke's quest for beautiful, and especially tiny, shells has taken him further than his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa and the Philippines, to name but a few of the beaches where he has lain on his stomach and looked for beauties to bring home. He is insistent that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who write him letters accusing him of stripping the world's beaches. 'When I am collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why should I not collect them?' If one bases this argument on the amount of luggage that can be carried home by one man, the sum beauty of whose work is often greater than its natural parts, it becomes very convincing indeed.",B2,"Peter Cooke is 83 years old. He makes art from shells. He makes small things like boxes and flowers. He shows his work in his home. He had an exhibition in London. Many people bought his art. His art is expensive. Some things cost £2,000. He uses shells from beaches in many countries. He only takes shells that are not alive. He is happy with his work.","Peter Cooke is 83 and very good at making art from shells. He creates delicate objects like shell-covered ornaments and flowers. He enjoys showing his work to visitors. He did not plan to sell his art, but friends suggested an exhibition. His first exhibition sold 70% of the pieces. His second exhibition is now open. The prices are high, up to £2,000, but he does not set them. He wishes he started earlier. He uses simple materials like cardboard and glue. He collects shells from beaches around the world but only dead ones to protect nature.","At 83, Peter Cooke has mastered the art of creating delicate objects from shells. He is enthusiastic about his work and enjoys sharing it with others. Initially, he did not intend to sell his pieces, but after friends encouraged him, he held an exhibition in London where 70% were sold. His second exhibition has just opened, with prices reaching around £2,000. Cooke regrets not starting earlier, as physical limitations now affect his work. His creations, such as shell-covered boxes and realistic flowers, are unique. He develops his own methods using materials like cardboard and special glue. He collects shells from international beaches, insisting he only takes dead shells to avoid harming marine life.","THE SHELL ARTIST

His inadvertent foray into commercial exhibitions, instigated by acquaintances, culminated in substantial sales, with his second showcase now inaugurated. Cooke exhibits nonchalance towards the exorbitant valuations of his work, which can approximate £2,000, while lamenting his belated artistic inception due to burgeoning physical limitations. His idiosyncratic methodology entails ad hoc material selection and meticulous attention to detail, yielding creations far surpassing commonplace shell crafts.

134,"Five-star luxury meets up-to-date technology
The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of considerable research into customer requirements and nearly two years' work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike.
At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel.
Though the system cost PS250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers.
For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences.
Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort. Guests have the opportunity to change the temperature themselves within three degrees either side of the normal l8degC but, in addition, each individual room can be adjusted by any amount between 14degC and 25degC at the front desk.
For guests, though, it is the other technology offered in their rooms which is most likely to find favour. This is particularly true for the business user, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five per cent of his business will come from this part of the market. To provide the best service for such needs, the hotel has taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms. Each one has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.
Technology changes so quickly these days that the hotel has had to try to forecast possible improvements. Extra cables have been laid to handle whatever scientific advances may occur. The televisions are rented rather than bought, so that they can be replaced with more up-to- date models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.
Despite the presence of all this very up-to-the-minute equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried hard not to make guests feel threatened by technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms, large and well-furnished, are both comfortable and welcoming. There are, of course, a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars and two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the heart of it all.
As at all luxury hotels, the food that is offered to guests must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he agreed to move his restaurant business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel site has huge benefits, both for him and the hotel itself. He has been able to design a new kitchen and take it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at the previous address, too. From the hotel's side, they are able to offer a popular and successful place to eat, with no financial risks attached. Aided by technology and a highly capable staff, the Merrion looks likely to succeed.

","The Merrion Hotel, a newly inaugurated five-star establishment in Dublin, is the culmination of extensive research into customer needs and nearly two years spent renovating four substantial eighteenth-century residences. This innovative approach facilitated the integration of state-of-the-art technology, enhancing efficiency for personnel and comfort for patrons alike. General Manager Peter MacCann mandates that staff address guests by name, yet relies on the hotel's sophisticated computer system to meticulously track individual preferences, thereby enabling exceptionally tailored treatment for returning visitors commensurate with five-star standards. Despite the £250,000 installation cost, MacCann asserts the system will prove cost-effective over time, lauding its operational efficacy and the array of amenities it affords. For example, the guest-history functionality allows staff to input diverse predilections, such as musical tastes, ensuring that preferred CDs are available upon subsequent stays. Additionally, a high-tech climate control system manages room temperature; guests may fine-tune it within a three-degree range of 18°C, while the front desk can calibrate it anywhere from 14°C to 25°C. The in-room technology, particularly appealing to business clients—projected to constitute up to sixty-five percent of the clientele—includes three telephones, dual phone lines, a multifunctional fax machine serving as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities, effectively transplanting the traditional business centre into private quarters. In anticipation of rapid technological evolution, the hotel has preemptively installed surplus cabling and opted to lease televisions, permitting seamless upgrades to newer models and DVD recorders as needed. Notwithstanding the proliferation of cutting-edge apparatus, MacCann emphasizes efforts to ensure the 145 spacious, elegantly appointed bedrooms remain inviting and non-intimidating, complemented by amenities such as a swimming pool, gymnasium, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a central garden. Culinary excellence is upheld by Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who relocated his two-Michelin-star restaurant to the premises, capitalizing on a custom-designed, modernized kitchen and superior parking facilities, thereby mitigating financial exposure for the hotel while offering a distinguished dining experience. Bolstered by advanced technology and a proficient workforce, the Merrion Hotel exhibits strong prospects for triumph.","The Merrion Hotel, an emergent five-star luxury venue in Dublin, represents the fruition of meticulous consumer research and a two-year transformation of four expansive Georgian townhouses, enabling the seamless incorporation of cutting-edge technological systems designed to augment both staff operational efficiency and guest experiential quality. Under the stewardship of General Manager Peter MacCann, personnel are expected to cultivate personal rapport by addressing guests nominatively, while the hotel's advanced computational infrastructure assiduously records and retrieves individual proclivities, facilitating a bespoke service paradigm for repeat patrons that aligns with the exacting standards of a five-star establishment. Although the initial outlay for the system amounted to £250,000, MacCann projects its amortization over time, extolling its unparalleled efficiency and the comprehensive suite of facilities it engenders. Illustratively, the guest-history module permits the logging of myriad preferences—such as specific musical genres—ensuring that curated CDs are preemptively available for returning visitors. Moreover, an sophisticated environmental control system governs room thermostasis; guests retain autonomy to modulate temperature within a three-degree variance of 18°C, with further adjustments possible from 14°C to 25°C via the front desk. The in-room technological array, which is particularly salient for business travellers—estimated to comprise up to sixty-five percent of the market segment—encompasses three telephones, dual dedicated phone lines, a multifunctional apparatus combining fax, photocopier, and printer functionalities, and video-conferencing provisions, effectively decentralizing the conventional business centre into individual accommodations. In cognizance of the relentless pace of technological advancement, the hotel has implemented redundant cabling infrastructures and adopted a leasing model for televisions, thereby ensuring facile upgrades to state-of-the-art models and DVD recorders as innovations emerge. Despite the pervasive integration of avant-garde equipment, MacCann underscores a concerted endeavor to preserve an ambiance of warmth and accessibility within the 145 capacious and sumptuously appointed bedrooms, which are supplemented by amenities including a swimming pool, fitness centre, six conference suites, two bars, two restaurants, and an idyllic central garden. Gastronomic distinction is assured by Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who transplanted his dual-Michelin-starred restaurant to the hotel, leveraging the opportunity to devise a contemporaneous kitchen and enhanced parking provisions, thus affording the hotel a preeminent culinary offering without attendant financial liabilities. Fortified by technological sophistication and an adept cadre of staff, the Merrion Hotel is unequivocally positioned for resounding success."
135,"The kingfisher

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers,feeding on fish.
Old trees overhang the stream, half shading shallow water. Soft greens, mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours, as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast, a slice of light and motion so striking you almost feel it. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers, its power out of proportion to its size.
Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. A sure sign of his depth of feeling for this little bird is his inability to identify just what it is that draws him to it. After all, it is the stuff of legend. Greek myth makes the kingfisher a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another tale tells how the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body took on the blue of the sky,while its underparts were scorched by the sun.
There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue.
This is why a kingfisher may appear to change from bright blue to rich emerald green with only a slight change in the angle at which light falls on it. It's small wonder that some wildlife photographers get so enthusiastic about them. Couple the colours with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of direct human approach, can be easy to watch from a hideout, and you have a recipe for a lifelong passion.
Charlie Jame's first hideout was an old blanket which he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favourite spot. The bird came back within minutes and sat only a metre away. But it took another four years, he reckons, before he got his first decent picture. In the meantime, the European kingfisher had begun to dominate his life. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream.
The trouble was, school cut the time available to be with the birds. So he missed lessons, becoming what he describes as an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only member of its cosmopolitan family to breed in Europe, was getting noticed.
At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman. What he'd really like to do now is make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech,just beautiful images which say it all,' he says. 'I'm attracted to the simple approach.

As a child, he saw one and was very happy. He spent a lot of time watching them, even missing school. Later, he worked for a nature magazine and became a filmmaker. He wants to make a film with only images of the kingfisher to show its colors and beauty.","The kingfisher is a striking blue-green bird found near streams, where it feeds on fish. Wildlife photographer Charlie James has a deep passion for kingfishers, dating back to his youth. He was so captivated that he often skipped school to observe them, which affected his studies. Despite this, his dedication led to a career in nature photography and filmmaking. He now aims to create a film about kingfishers using only visuals to express their beauty, as words cannot fully capture his connection to these birds.","The kingfisher

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher: a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers,feeding on fish.
Old trees overhang the stream, half shading shallow water. Soft greens, mud browns and the many different yellows of sunlight are the main colours, as soft as the sounds of water in the breeze. The bird cuts like a laser through the scene, straight and fast, a slice of light and motion so striking you almost feel it. It has gone in a split second, but a trace of the image lingers, its power out of proportion to its size.
Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers at an early age. A sure sign of his depth of feeling for this little bird is his inability to identify just what it is that draws him to it. After all, it is the stuff of legend. Greek myth makes the kingfisher a moon goddess who turned into a bird. Another tale tells how the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body took on the blue of the sky,while its underparts were scorched by the sun.
There is some scientific truth in that story. For despite the many different blues that appear in their coats, kingfishers have no blue pigment at all in their feathers. Rather, the structure of their upper feathers scatters light and strongly reflects blue.
This is why a kingfisher may appear to change from bright blue to rich emerald green with only a slight change in the angle at which light falls on it. It's small wonder that some wildlife photographers get so enthusiastic about them. Couple the colours with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of direct human approach, can be easy to watch from a hideout, and you have a recipe for a lifelong passion.
Charlie Jame's first hideout was an old blanket which he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favourite spot. The bird came back within minutes and sat only a metre away. But it took another four years, he reckons, before he got his first decent picture. In the meantime, the European kingfisher had begun to dominate his life. He spent all the time he could by a kingfisher-rich woodland stream.
The trouble was, school cut the time available to be with the birds. So he missed lessons, becoming what he describes as an 'academic failure'. But his interest in this, the world's most widespread kingfisher and the only member of its cosmopolitan family to breed in Europe, was getting noticed.
At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. Work as an assistant to the editor followed, then a gradual move to life as a freelance wildlife film cameraman. What he'd really like to do now is make the ultimate kingfisher film. 'No speech,just beautiful images which say it all,' he says. 'I'm attracted to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings ...'
The sentence trails off to nothing. He's thinking of those colours of the bird he's spent more than half his life close to, yet which still excites interest. The photographs succeed in communicating something of his feelings. But, as Charlie knows, there's so much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can ever show.","The kingfisher, a resplendent blue-green avian species inhabiting riparian zones, preys predominantly on fish. Charlie James, an accomplished wildlife photographer, developed an profound affinity for kingfishers in his formative years. His intense fascination compelled him to prioritize birdwatching over academic pursuits, resulting in what he terms academic failure. Nonetheless, his expertise garnered professional opportunities, including roles at a nature periodical and subsequently as a freelance cinematographer. James aspires to produce an evocative film centered on kingfishers, eschewing narration in favor of imagery that conveys the ineffable allure and chromatic brilliance of these birds, which continues to inspire him profoundly.","The kingfisher, an exquisitely hued bird of azure and verdant tones, frequents streamside habitats, subsisting on piscine prey. Charlie James, a preeminent wildlife photographer, harbors an abiding devotion to kingfishers, kindled in his youth. This ardor led him to neglect scholastic duties in favor of avian observation, a choice he retrospectively deems academic failure. His specialized knowledge, however, precipitated a career trajectory encompassing advisory roles for nature publications and evolution into freelance wildlife cinematography. James's current ambition is to craft a cinematic masterpiece on kingfishers, employing a minimalist aesthetic devoid of dialogue, whereby the visual splendor and dynamic iridescence of the birds articulate the profundity of his enduring, yet incompletely communicable, rapport with the species."
136,"Five-star luxury meets up-to-date technology

The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of considerable research into customer requirements and nearly two years' work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike.
At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel.
Though the system cost PS250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers.
For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences.
Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort. Guests have the opportunity to change the temperature themselves within three degrees either side of the normal l8degC but, in addition, each individual room can be adjusted by any amount between 14degC and 25degC at the front desk.
For guests, though, it is the other technology offered in their rooms which is most likely to find favour. This is particularly true for the business user, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five per cent of his business will come from this part of the market. To provide the best service for such needs, the hotel has taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms. Each one has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.
Technology changes so quickly these days that the hotel has had to try to forecast possible improvements. Extra cables have been laid to handle whatever scientific advances may occur. The televisions are rented rather than bought, so that they can be replaced with more up-to- date models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.
Despite the presence of all this very up-to-the-minute equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried hard not to make guests feel threatened by technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms, large and well-furnished, are both comfortable and welcoming. There are, of course, a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars and two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the heart of it all.
As at all luxury hotels, the food that is offered to guests must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he agreed to move his restaurant business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel site has huge benefits, both for him and the hotel itself. He has been able to design a new kitchen and take it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at the previous address, too. From the hotel's side, they are able to offer a popular and successful place to eat, with no financial risks attached.

137,"Film Critic

Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page.
Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff.
At first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable.
It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time: a new newspaper, and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. In fact, the first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of my reviews appeared, I didn't know where to look.
Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film.
The luxury of this way of working suits me well. I wouldn't have been interested in the more standard film critic's role, which involves considering every film that comes out. That's a routine that would make me stale in no time at all. I would soon be sinking into my seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What insulting rubbish must I sit through now?' - a style of sigh that can often be heard in screening rooms around the world.
The space I am given allows me to broaden my argument - or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. There is also such a thing as loyalty to 'type' or its opposite. It can only rarely happen that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story addict avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say.
So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument.

Prior to this, he had engaged in sporadic reviewing—novels for various newspapers, films for a magazine, and assorted assignments for radio—leading to his acquaintance with Tom Seaton, the inaugural arts editor, who recruited him. Tom's initial conception involved a cadre of critics addressing art forms devoid of specialized knowledge, such as literature, television, theatre, cinema, and radio, with convivial weekly luncheons to deliberate on coverage. At the time, Mark perceived it as quasi-utopian, marred by his own insecurities and skepticism regarding the newspaper's viability in a saturated market. Regrettably, the collaborative scheme never materialized; operations were conducted telephonically, and public inclination favored reviewers specializing in singular domains, prompting Mark's dedication to film. Absent Tom's impetus, the current modus operandi—wherein he produces an extensive weekly critique typically centered on one film—would scarcely have ensued. This luxurious approach aligns with his predilections, eschewing the conventional critic's duty of evaluating every release, which he deems monotonous and enervating. He posits that cinematic choices are predominantly influenced by stellar casts, promotional efforts, or directorial repute, with reviews seldom altering entrenched preferences. Consequently, he disavows any consumer guidance or judicial function, instead advancing nuanced arguments in his critiques.","Mark Adams engages in a retrospective analysis of his decade-long career as a film critic for The Front Page, which marked his entry into professional journalism. Preceding this, he had undertaken intermittent reviewing endeavors—encompassing novels for disparate newspapers, cinematic works for a periodical, and miscellaneous radio commissions—culminating in his encounter with Tom Seaton, the publication's founding arts editor, who enlisted him. Tom's original stratagem envisaged an ensemble of critics presiding over art forms not necessitating esoteric expertise, including literary works, television, theatrical productions, film, and radio, with weekly gastronomic assemblies intended to foster sociability and curate content. During that nascent phase, Mark regarded the enterprise as almost phantasmagorical, compounded by his profound self-doubt and incredulity at the newspaper's incursion into an overcrowded marketplace. However, this collaborative framework failed to coalesce; interactions devolved to telephonic exchanges, and public proclivities gravitated towards reviewers with singular specializations, thus cementing Mark's focus on film. Devoid of Tom's initial impetus, the extant paradigm—wherein he authors a protracted weekly exposition generally concentrating on a solitary film—would have been improbable. This opulent methodology resonates with his sensibilities, precluding the orthodox critic's obligation to appraise every release, a regimen he considers stultifying and conducive to creative atrophy. He contends that audience selections are principally dictated by star power, promotional stratagems, or auteur affiliations, with critical assessments rarely subverting ingrained antipathies or allegiances. Ergo, he repudiates any pretense of consumer advisement or adjudicatory capacity, instead proffering erudite polemics in his critiques."
138,"Fun at the Dentist's?

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch which patients sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.'.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. 'We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. 'One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself', he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder. The surgery seems more like an elegant beauty parlour than a mainstream dental practice.",B2,"A dentist in Glasgow is different. His office has nice pictures and a blue couch.

After researching in the USA, he advocates a patient-centred approach to make dentistry less formal. Patients receive personalised care, such as tea and video choices, making the experience feel more like a beauty parlour than a traditional dentist.","Fun at the Dentist's?

Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.'.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. 'We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. 'One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself', he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder. The surgery seems more like an elegant beauty parlour than a mainstream dental practice.","Upon entering W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in central Glasgow, one encounters vibrant modern paintings and a stylish blue couch where patients recline during examinations. Jerome observes that half the populace only seeks dental care when in pain, primarily due to fear, and he has deliberately cultivated an environment to alleviate this anxiety. Eschewing the white coat, which he identifies as a symbol of distress, his ethos prioritises relaxation, engagement, and enjoyment in dental treatment. This approach is startling for those accustomed to associating dentistry with discomfort or clinical formality. He employs virtual-reality headsets, a pioneering technique in British practice, allowing patients to immerse in underwater documentaries during initial assessments, followed by a visual exploration of their oral cavity via a camera. The surgery's ambiance is enhanced by fragrances such as orange, countering the alarming scent of surgical spirit. Despite his reputation as a fashionable dentist, Jerome underscores the paramount importance of treatment quality, utilising advanced methods like warm water sprays for non-invasive cleaning. His patient-centred philosophy, informed by research in the United States, champions a shift towards informality in the conservative field of British dentistry, exemplified by offerings of herbal or regular tea and personalised video selections, transforming the experience into one reminiscent of an elegant beauty parlour.","In the heart of Glasgow, W. Lloyd Jerome's dental practice defies conventional expectations with its contemporary artworks and plush blue seating for patients. Jerome notes that a significant proportion of individuals defer dental visits until compelled by pain, a behaviour rooted in trepidation. To mitigate this, he has engineered an ambiance devoid of traditional fear-inducing elements, such as forgoing the white coat, which he perceives as an emblem of suffering. His overarching philosophy advocates for dental interventions within a milieu of tranquillity, intellectual stimulation, and paramount enjoyment, a notion that challenges entrenched associations of dentistry with agony or sterile clinical encounters. Innovative relaxation methodologies include virtual-reality headsets, introduced as a British first, whereby patients view aquatic documentaries during examinations, subsequently transitioning to an intraoral visual tour. The olfactory environment, imbued with scents like citrus, deliberately contrasts with the anxiety-provoking odour of antiseptics. While renowned for his avant-garde approach, Jerome emphasises the primacy of therapeutic excellence, employing modalities such as thermohydraulic instrumentation for gentle cleansing. His patient-centric paradigm, refined through stateside research, posits that facilitating patient comfort concurrently simplifies procedural execution, heralding a gradual departure from formality in the traditionally conservative domain of British dentistry. This is manifest in bespoke amenities like beverage offerings and curated media, culminating in an experience that evokes the refinement of a high-end aesthetic salon rather than a mundane dental clinic."

If you're thinking of taking children to a theme park, there are dozens to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to test the best.
Fun Island - The Burns family
Last year we went to a huge theme park in the US and we thought that Fun Island might seem dull by comparison. In fact, we were impressed. The park tries hard to cater for younger children, so our three-year-old didn't feel left out. The kids all loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There's a special dodgems ride for the very young kids, which was a great success. For older children, there are scarier rides, such as Splash Out, where you end up jumping in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to call it a day, but the children objected because they were having such fun. Our only criticism would be that the park is slightly lacking in atmosphere, and the scenery leaves something to be desired. But the staff are extremely helpful and we felt it was clean, well organised and very security-conscious.
Wonderland - The McMillan family
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn't know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he adored it. He was in heaven on the Mountain Train, and particularly liked Little Land, with its small replicas of famous buildings that were at his level! The older children enjoyed the ferris wheel, and loved driving the toy cars on a proper road layout. We spent six hours there and were glad that there were places where you could put your feet up. The landscaping is perfect and the staff very helpful and friendly. And there's something for everyone, adults included.
Adventure World - The Jeffree family
After seven hours we felt there was still a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a fantastic trapeze act and kept us on the edge of our seats. We went on the Terror Line and, although the girls were rather scared and kept their eyes shut most of the time, they said they'd enjoyed it. Their favourite ride was Running River, where you think you're going to get soaked, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The children had a look at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we breathed a sigh of relief when they found that they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even queuing for rides isn't too boring. It's spotlessly clean, and the staff are great. On one ride I couldn't sit with both girls, so a member of staff offered to go with one of them.
The Great Park - The Langridge family
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a super theme park for younger children because the rides aren't too terrifying. I'm a real coward but even I enjoyed myself. We all adored Exotic Travels, a boat ride which starts off quite tamely and then becomes terrific fun. We queued for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over before we knew it! I wouldn't go on the Big Leap, but if you have the nerve, it looked great. If the children had been a little older, they might have found it a bit tame, but they were all in the right age group and they loved it.
Fantasy World - The Break-all family
According to the park's advertising there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we certainly felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, dominates the skyline, and Ben thought it was the most terrifying of the rides, although Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 metres above the ground, was even worse! There are a dozen or so main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for a couple of them, but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff attitudes were mixed. Some of them were great with the younger children, but the welcome wasn't always as warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn't have dared tell the kids we were going home early.

","When contemplating a visit to a theme park with children in Britain, a plethora of choices exist. Five families were enlisted to assess premier parks. The Burns family, having previously visited a large American theme park, were pleasantly surprised by Fun Island. It adeptly accommodates younger children with attractions such as the Crocodile Ride and a specialized dodgems ride, while older children relish more exhilarating options like Splash Out. Although the park excels in cleanliness, organization, and security, it falls short in atmospheric depth and scenic appeal. The McMillan family, novices to theme parks, found Wonderland enchanting. Their son Oscar was enthralled by the Mountain Train and Little Land, featuring scaled replicas of famous structures, and older children delighted in the ferris wheel and toy car circuits. The park's meticulous landscaping and amiable staff enhanced the experience. At Adventure World, the Jeffree family discovered an abundance of attractions, including a gripping Big Top Circus with a trapeze act and rides such as Running River that provided excitement without drenching participants. The park's design minimizes queue boredom, and the staff's willingness to accompany children on rides underscored their dedication. The Langridge family appreciated The Great Park for its suitability to younger children, with rides like Exotic Travels offering gradual thrills. However, the early 5 p.m. closure was a disappointment. Fantasy World, as visited by the Break-all family, boasts formidable rides like the Rocket and the Hanger, though staff attitudes were inconsistent. Despite this, the children's enjoyment was paramount, necessitating a full day for comprehensive exploration.","For those deliberating over theme park excursions with children in Britain, an extensive array of establishments is available. Five families were commissioned to trial the most esteemed parks. The Burns family, drawing comparisons to a prior visit to a monumental American theme park, found Fun Island commendable; it assiduously caters to younger demographics with features like the Crocodile Ride and a bespoke dodgems attraction, while adolescents are engaged by more daunting rides such as Splash Out. Notwithstanding its impeccable cleanliness, organizational prowess, and security vigilance, the park is somewhat deficient in ambiance and scenic grandeur. The McMillan family, unacquainted with theme parks hitherto, were captivated by Wonderland; their progeny Oscar was transported by the Mountain Train and Little Land's miniature architectural replicas, and elder children savored the ferris wheel and toy vehicle conduits. The park's exquisite landscaping and cordial, supportive staff significantly augmented the visit. At Adventure World, the Jeffree family encountered a profusion of diversions, including a riveting Big Top Circus with an acrobatic trapeze performance and rides like Running River that tantalize with the prospect of immersion yet abstain from saturation. The park's architectural ingenuity alleviates the tedium of queues, and the staff's proactive assistance, such as accompanying solitary children, was particularly noteworthy. The Langridge family esteemed The Great Park for its appropriateness for younger children, with attractions like Exotic Travels escalating from placid to exhilarating; however, the premature 5 p.m. closure proved a letdown. Fantasy World, as evaluated by the Break-all family, is dominated by Europe's preeminent roller-coaster, the Rocket, and the inverted Hanger, though staff demeanor was variable. The children's fervent participation on myriad rides dictated that a full diurnal period was indispensable for thorough enjoyment."

Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.
With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently. She now employs an extra gardener but, despite the need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.",B2,"Susan Shepherd is an artist.

A harmonious interplay of colour, form, and structure characterises the dual elongated flower borders flanking the paved transversal path, a legacy largely attributable to the prior proprietors, ardent horticulturists who bequeathed flora that resonated with Susan. She likewise inherited the gardener, Danny, with whom she cultivated an amicable rapport; initially, he expressed reservations regarding certain incorporations, yet upon learning of her artistic intentions, he apprehended her vision. Susan's proclivity leans towards meticulous examinations of singular specimens rather than panoramic garden vistas, though she occasionally renders groups in situ; typically, she harvests them for her studio, eschewing comprehensive setups in favour of a cumulative approach that may span years. The zenith of her annual activity coincides with spring and early summer, during the efflorescence of tulips and poppies, yet she is equally captivated by the gradual senescence, observing how tulips, for instance, metamorphose into distinctive configurations upon hydration. Her enduring botanical interest, rooted in scholastic botany and erstwhile foraging of wildflowers—which she once esteemed as authentically natural—now embraces cultivated varieties, with her garden hosting exotic species that thrive as if native. She adopts a laissez-faire disposition towards the garden, akin to a benevolent aunt permitting untrammelled play, and despite impending exhibitions constraining her horticultural engagement, she engages manually to preserve an intimate bond with her muse, notwithstanding additional gardening assistance.","Susan Shepherd, an artist distinguished for her intricate floral oeuvre, derives much of her subject matter from the expansive garden that encircles her domicile, replete with her favoured blossoms, predominantly tulips and poppies, some of which exhibit a propensity for spontaneous proliferation. The two protracted flower borders, which delineate the paved path traversing the garden longitudinally, evince a sophisticated consonance of chromatic, morphological, and structural elements, a testament to the horticultural zeal of the antecedent owners, who curated a collection that captivated Susan. She also assimilated the services of the gardener, Danny, fostering a congenial relationship; his initial scepticism towards certain proposed additions was mitigated upon comprehending her artistic impetus. Susan's methodology prioritises exhaustive analyses of individual flora over holistic garden representations, albeit she intermittently depicts assemblages in their native milieu; more conventionally, she excises specimens for her atelier, eschewing instantaneous compositions in favour of an incremental technique that may necessitate biennial durations. Her most exigent seasonal interval is spring and early summer, marked by the simultaneous anthesis of tulips and poppies, yet she is equally enthralled by the inexorable process of decay, noting how tulips, for example, undergo remarkable transformations—unfurling into fantastical shapes—post-hydration. A lifelong fascination with botany, cultivated through academic study and the collection of wildflowers, which she once deemed uniquely genuine, now extends to cultivated varieties, with her garden incorporating species of remote provenance that acclimatise seamlessly. Her philosophical approach to gardening is one of benign indulgence, reminiscent of an affectionate aunt countenancing unbridled juvenile exuberance, and despite the exigencies of preparing for dual forthcoming exhibitions, she insists on manual horticultural engagement to sustain an intrinsic connection with her subjects, notwithstanding supplementary gardening personnel."

She now employs an extra gardener but, despite the need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.",B2,"Susan Shepherd is an artist.

She says you must work in the garden to understand it.","Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden has many flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wild in the garden. The flower borders have nice colors and shapes. The previous owners were gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. They got on well. At first, Danny did not like some of her ideas, but he understood when she said she wanted to paint them. Susan prefers to paint detailed pictures of single plants, not the whole garden. She often picks flowers and takes them to her studio. She paints one flower at a time, which can take days, and adds others slowly. Sometimes a painting takes years to finish. Spring and early summer are her busiest times. She finds it interesting how flowers decay and change shape in water. Susan studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She thought garden flowers were not real, but wild ones were special. Now, her garden has plants from faraway places. She has a relaxed attitude, like an aunt who lets children play freely. With two exhibitions coming, she has little time for gardening. She has an extra gardener but knows she must work in the garden to stay connected to her art.","Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and her large garden provides many subjects. It is filled with her favourite flowers, particularly tulips and poppies, with some plants growing wildly. The two long flower borders along the paved path show a harmony of colour, shape, and structure, partly due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also inherited the gardener, Danny, and they had a good relationship. Initially, he was sceptical about some of her ideas, but he understood when she explained her painting intentions. Susan focuses on detailed studies of individual plants rather than the entire garden, though she occasionally paints groups in place. More often, she picks flowers and takes them to her studio, building up paintings gradually by adding one flower at a time over days or even years. Her busiest period is spring and early summer when tulips and poppies bloom. She is fascinated by the decaying process of flowers, noting how tulips change shape in water over time. Susan has always been interested in plants, having studied botany and collected wild flowers as a child, when she preferred them over garden flowers. Now, her garden includes plants from distant regions, and she has a come-what-may attitude, similar to a permissive aunt. With two upcoming exhibitions, she finds little time for gardening and employs an extra gardener, but she believes getting hands dirty is essential to maintain her connection with her subjects.","An eye for detail

Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.
With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently. She now employs an extra gardener but, despite the need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, 'you have to get your hands dirty'.","Renowned for her floral artworks, Susan Shepherd derives much of her inspiration from the extensive garden enveloping her residence, which abounds with her preferred blossoms, notably diverse tulips and poppies, some of which propagate unrestrainedly. Aesthetic consonance in hue, form, and composition characterises the dual elongated flower borders flanking the east-west paved traverse, a legacy from the prior proprietors, ardent horticulturists who bequeathed flora that resonated with Susan. She likewise retained the services of the gardener, Danny, with whom she fostered an amicable rapport; initially, he expressed reservations regarding certain of her horticultural incorporations, yet apprehended her artistic vision upon learning of her painterly objectives. Susan predominantly concentrates on meticulous examinations of singular specimens rather than panoramic garden vistas, albeit she intermittently depicts plant assemblages in situ. Typically, she harvests blossoms and transports them to her atelier, incrementally constructing her compositions by isolating and painting individual flowers over protracted durations, occasionally spanning years. The zenith of her artistic endeavours occurs during spring and early summer with the efflorescence of tulips and poppies. She is captivated by the gradual senescence of flora, observing, for instance, how tulips, once placed in aqueous mediums, undergo morphological transformations, evolving from initial banality to dynamic configurations. Susan's perennial botanical interest stems from scholastic botany studies and erstwhile foraging of wildflowers, which she esteemed for their tenacity in adverse habitats, in contrast to cultivated varieties she once deemed artificial. Presently, her garden hosts exotic species from remote locales, assimilated seamlessly, and she maintains a laissez-faire disposition, analogous to an indulgent aunt permitting juvenile liberty. Confronted with dual imminent exhibitions, temporal constraints impede her gardening pursuits, necessitating an auxiliary gardener; nonetheless, she upholds the imperative of manual engagement to sustain her profound nexus with her thematic essence.","Eminent artist Susan Shepherd is predominantly celebrated for her exquisite floral paintings, with the capacious garden encircling her domicile serving as the principal provenance for her subjects, replete with her favoured blossoms, most notably an assortment of tulips and poppies, some of which exhibit a propensity for untrammelled proliferation. The two protracted flower borders, which delineate the paved pathway traversing the garden from east to west, evince a symphonic interplay of colour, morphology, and structure, largely attributable to the antecedent owners, who were devoted horticulturists and bequeathed a selection of plants that captivated Susan. Concomitantly, she inherited the gardener, Danny, with whom she cultivated a highly congenial relationship; initially, he would demur at certain of her proposed additions, deeming them inconsequential, but upon her elucidating her painterly aspirations, he discerned her conceptual framework. Susan's proclivity leans towards intricate analyses of individual flora as opposed to holistic garden representations, though she does on occasion render groups of plants in their native milieu. More customarily, she culls specimens and conveys them to her studio, eschewing comprehensive setups in favour of a sequential approach wherein she isolates a single flower for depiction over several days, progressively amalgamating additional elements, a process that may extend over biennial periods. The apogee of her creative industry coincides with the vernal and early estival seasons, marked by the simultaneous blossoming of tulips and poppies. She is profoundly engrossed by the incremental process of floral decay, noting, for example, how tulips, upon immersion in hydrous environments, undergo idiosyncratic conformational shifts, transmuting from an initial state of insipidity to spectacular, undulating forms. Susan's enduring fascination with botany originated from academic pursuits and habitual collection of wildflowers from rural environs, during which epoch she disdained cultivated varieties as ersatz imitations, venerating instead the resilience of wild species thriving in inhospitable niches. In her contemporary garden, which integrates flora indigenous to distant territories such as China and the Himalayas, she espouses a philosophical stance of acquiescence, reminiscent of a benevolent aunt countenancing juvenile exuberance provided no substantive detriment ensues. With two forthcoming exhibitions impending, temporal exigencies have recently precluded extensive horticultural engagement, prompting the employment of an additional gardener; nevertheless, she cognises the indispensability of manual labour in preserving an intimate connection with her artistic motifs."

Five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys.
A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to get back there as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes.It never matters what the weather is like, or what time of the year it is, it is always enchanting. Out of the other window are some of the best back gardens and residences in the whole of France. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.
Raj Patel - Explorer
I have enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if I had to pick a favourite it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in my youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park. I was regarded as being too young and troublesome and was sent off to an aunt. When I came to live in England as a teenager, I still hadn't travelled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I ever saw and its great glass dome filled me with wonder.
Betty Cooper - Novelist
I am indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. It was on the train that my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was absolutely wonderful. Someone happened to mention that pink was good for the brain, and I've never stopped wearing the colour since. What I remember about the journey itself, however, is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Ll,!XOrI.t was, without a doubt, the perfect way to wind down after all the wedding preparations.
Martin Brown - Journalist
We were working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way we could continue our journey was to take what was affectionately known as the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We also heard that, in any case,the driver would often wait for days to depart if he knew there were people still on their way. When it appeared, there was a sudden charge of what seemed like hundreds of people climbing into and onto the carriages - people were even allowed to travel on the roof free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like travelling across the moon.

I imagine most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not my case. I was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains began to dominate my life. I made a film which featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, disused stretch of the line which had been lovingly maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we took every opportunity to have a ride on the train, and, when I went back last year, it was as if time had stood still. Everything was still in place, even the gas lights on the station platform!

","Five distinguished personalities divulge to Andrew Morgan their most cherished recollections of railway expeditions. Andrea Thompson extols a regional train departing from Cannes, meandering along the coastline into Italy, which perpetually enthralls with its magnificent seascapes and affords voyeuristic vistas into the opulent estates of the affluent, all amidst a convivial amalgamation of itinerants and residents. Raj Patel, an explorer, singles out the Nile Valley Express traversing the northern Sudanese desert as his paramount journey, lamenting a missed familial rail excursion in his South African youth due to perceived juvenility and later marveling at London Waterloo's grandiose architecture upon his relocation to England. Betty Cooper, a novelist, expresses indebtedness to the Blue Train for ferrying her and her spouse on their nuptial voyage across France en route to Egypt, where the bestowal of a pink dress—inspired by its purported cerebral benefits—and the serene progression up the Nile constituted an idyllic post-nuptial repose. Martin Brown, a journalist, recounts utilizing the Desert Express in an African nation's arid region for a globetrotting assignment, characterized by an erratic schedule and a frenetic embarkation of multitudes, including roof passengers, while the nocturnal passage unveiled surreal, lunar-esque terrains. Arisu Mezuki, an actress, clarifies that her ardor for railways was cultivated not in childhood but during adolescent filming in Yorkshire on a meticulously conserved, disused line, where immersive experiences aboard a steam locomotive fostered a timeless appreciation.","Five eminent figures impart to Andrew Morgan their most esteemed reminiscences of railway peregrinations. Andrea Thompson, a newsreader, venerates a provincial train originating in Cannes, which skirts the littoral into Italy, invariably enchanting with its sublime marine panoramas and providing clandestine glimpses into the resplendent domains of the elite, all shared among an animated cohort of wayfarers and indigenes. Raj Patel, an explorer, privileges the Nile Valley Express coursing through the northern Sudanese desert above all other rail journeys, reflecting on a forgone familial expedition from Cape Town to Kruger National Park in his South African boyhood—owing to his deemed precocity—and his inaugural encounter with London Waterloo's majestic vitreous dome upon adolescent emigration to England. Betty Cooper, a novelist, acknowledges a profound debt to the Blue Train for conveying her and her consort on their matrimonial sojourn across France to embark for Egypt, where the presentation of a pink raiment—spurred by its alleged cognitive virtues—and the tranquil voyage up the Nile epitomized an impeccable denouement to nuptial preparations. Martin Brown, a journalist, delineates employing the Desert Express in an African nation's desolate expanse for a circumnavigational series, noting its capricious timetable and the tumultuous influx of passengers, including those availing complimentary rooftop passage, whilst the nocturnal traverse revealed ethereal, almost oneiric topographies. Arisu Mezuki, an actress, elucidates that her fervor for locomotives was not nascent in youth but burgeoned during an adolescent cinematic endeavor on a defunct Yorkshire railway, fastidiously upheld by enthusiasts, where recurrent rides on a vintage steam train engendered an enduring, immutable passion."
143,"Miss Rita Cohen, a tiny, pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be some six years older, came to his facto1y one day. She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes, and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She was so tiny, so young that he could barely believe that she was at the University of Pennsylvania, doing research into the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
Three or four times a year someone either phoned Seymour or wrote to him to ask permission to see his factory, and occasionally he would assist a student by answering questions over the phone or, if the student struck him as especially serious, by offering a brief tour.
Rita Cohen was nearly as small, he thought, as the children from Marie's third-year class, who'd been brought the 50 kilometres from their rural schoolhouse one day, all those years ago, so that Marie's daddy could show them how he made gloves, show them especially Marie's favourite spot, the laying-off table, where, at the end of the process, the men shaped and pressed each and every glove by pulling it carefully down over steam-heated brass hands. The hands were dangerously hot and they were shiny and they stuck straight up from the table in a row, thin-looking, like hands that had been flattened. As a little girl, Marie was captivated by their strangeness and called them the 'pancake hands'.
He heard Rita asking, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'How many? Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She continued taking notes as she asked, 'They come direct to your shipping department?'
He liked finding that she was interested in eve1y last detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material and they make it into the right kind of weather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery right here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started working in the business. Ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you've got to go to a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I'll set that up for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. The technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't that different from what you'd have seen hundreds of years ago. Awful work. It's said to be the oldest industry of which remains have been found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old relics of tanning found somewhere Turkey, I believe.

Attired in utilitarian overalls and substantial footwear, her countenance was accentuated by a profusion of wiry hair; despite her seemingly tender age, she asserted seniority over Seymour's daughter and was engaged in scholarly research on the leather sector at the University of Pennsylvania for her master's qualification. Periodically, Seymour accommodated academic inquiries, and upon discerning Rita's earnest dedication—evidenced by her meticulous queries regarding consignment volumes and tannery operations—he reflected on a paternal memory involving his daughter Marie's captivation with the 'pancake hands,' steam-heated brass implements employed in the final glove-shaping phase. Rita's vivacious intellect and inquisitiveness evoked parallels to Marie's academic fervor, prompting Seymour to proffer an exhaustive demonstration of the glove fabrication continuum, culminating in a solicitation of her glove dimensions.","Miss Rita Cohen, a diminutive and pallid-complexioned young woman whose appearance belied her actual age—purportedly exceeding that of Seymour's daughter, Marie, by approximately six years—made an appearance at his glove factory. Clad in overalls and unappealingly large footwear, her visage was encircled by a bush of wiry hair; her stature was so slight and juvenile that Seymour scarcely credited her enrollment at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was conducting research into New Jersey's leather industry for her master's degree. Annually, Seymour received several entreaties for factory access, and he occasionally indulged serious students with telephonic responses or abbreviated tours. Rita's petite form evoked recollections of Marie's third-grade classmates, who had journeyed fifty kilometers to witness the glove-making process, particularly the laying-off table with its perilously heated, slender brass hands—denominated 'pancake hands' by the enthralled young Marie. As Rita interrogated him on shipment quantities and tannery logistics, Seymour appreciated her exhaustive curiosity, recounting his familial tannery heritage and the antiquity of tanning, exemplified by six-millennia-old artifacts. Her ingenuous yet spirited demeanor, coupled with an intellect reminiscent of Marie's scholastic absorption, inspired Seymour to orchestrate a comprehensive glove-manufacturing exposition, inquiring as to her requisite glove size."
144,"It's true - we're all getting too big for our boots
Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'
For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.
This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.
Nevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.
As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.
The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.
However, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, members of the human race were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have got slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.
",B2,"Chris Greener is very tall. He is Britain's tallest man. People in Europe are getting taller. Long ago, people ate many different foods. Then, farming started. People ate only a few plants. This made people smaller and sick. Now, in some countries, people eat better and are taller. But tall people have problems. Beds and seats are too small. Scientists think people will not get taller forever. Also, the world is getting hotter. This might make people smaller.","Chris Greener is Britain's tallest man. When he was young, he was already very tall. People in Europe are growing taller each decade. This is because diets are improving. In the past, people were hunter-gatherers and ate many wild plants. But after farming began, people ate mostly wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet made people unhealthy and shorter. Now, in places like Europe and the US, people eat better and are taller. However, tall people face issues like small beds and seats on planes. Scientists say people may stop growing taller soon. Also, global warming could make people smaller in the future.","Chris Greener, Britain's tallest man, was very tall even as a teenager. On average, people in Europe are becoming taller by about one centimetre every ten years. This increase is due to better nutrition, which is helping humans return to the height of our Cro-Magnon ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Historically, hunter-gatherers had diverse diets with many plants, but the shift to agriculture led to reliance on just a few crops like wheat and rice, causing poor health and reduced height. Although agriculture supported more people, it resulted in widespread malnutrition. Today, improved diets in wealthy nations are reversing this trend, but taller stature brings challenges such as inadequate bed sizes and limited legroom in transport. Scientists predict that average height may peak around 193 cm this century, but global warming could cause humans to become smaller over time.","It's true - we're all getting too big for our boots
Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'

","Chris Greener, who stands at 228 cm, is Britain's tallest individual, a status foreshadowed in his youth. The average height in Europe is incrementally increasing by one centimetre per decade, a trend attributed to enhanced nutritional standards that are enabling humans to approximate the stature of Cro-Magnons from 40,000 years ago. Historically, hunter-gatherers subsisted on a wide array of wild plants, but the advent of agriculture approximately 9,000 years ago precipitated a reliance on calorie-dense staples like wheat, rice, and maize, culminating in deleterious health outcomes and stunted growth. While agriculture facilitated population expansion, it engendered chronic undernourishment. Contemporary dietary improvements in affluent regions are ameliorating these effects, yet rising heights pose logistical issues, including outdated bed dimensions and cramped transportation seating. Experts project a potential ceiling for human height at 193 cm within this century, though anthropogenic climate change may induce a gradual reduction in size as an adaptive response to warming conditions.","Chris Greener, Britain's preeminent giant at 228 cm, exhibited prodigious height from adolescence, as noted by his careers teacher. The mean stature in Europe is escalating by a centimetre per decade, reflecting a resurgence towards the physical dimensions of Cro-Magnon humans, owing to superior nutrition that counteracts millennia of dietary impoverishment. Ancestral hunter-gatherers exploited a diverse phytological repertoire, but the Neolithic Revolution instigated a dependence on triumvirate cereals—wheat, rice, and maize—which precipitated nutritional deficits and compromised physiognomy. Although agrarian systems sustained demographic surges, they perpetuated widespread malnutrition, only recently addressed in developed nations. Consequently, heightened statures in regions like Europe and the US introduce ancillary complications, such as antiquated bed lengths and constricted vehicular accommodations. Scholarly projections posit an asymptotic limit to human height around 193 cm this century, yet anthropogenic global warming may instigate a diminutive trend, offsetting gains through thermoregulatory adaptations."

","There is a verifiable trend of increasing human stature, exemplified by Chris Greener, Britain's tallest individual.

Contemporary improvements in diet within affluent regions are enabling a return to ancestral height potentials. Nonetheless, this growth poses practical issues, including mismatches with standard bed lengths and cramped transportation seating. Experts suggest a ceiling for human height may be approached this century, although global warming could induce a countervailing trend toward diminution in stature.","The escalation in human height is an indisputable reality, epitomized by Chris Greener, who holds the distinction of being Britain's tallest man. This progression signifies a reversal of the deleterious effects imposed by millennia of inadequate nutrition; whereas prehistoric humans benefited from a heterogeneous diet procured through hunting and gathering, the Neolithic revolution precipitated a reliance on a limited array of carbohydrate-rich crops, culminating in widespread malnutrition and stunted growth.

Four people talk about their jobs.
Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum
I'm responsible for putting temporary exhibitions together. This includes planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. I have to read up about the subject of the exhibition beforehand and then talk to important people in the area so that I can establish the main themes and aims of the exhibition, and plan what objects and pictures should be displayed. I have to make sure the public can understand the thinking behind the exhibition, which means planning interactive displays, workshops and theatre. I also have to bring in engineers and electricians to make sure the final display is not dangerous to visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write the brochures and leaflets that we'll use to tell people about it.

Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers
The first thing I do when I get here at 7.30 a.m. is check the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents need to be produced in order to learn the 'runs' or routes necessary to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, working out how to make the journeys. They work out the most direct route, using the correct one-way streets, and right- and left- hand turns. I get involved when there's a difference of opinion - like whether you can do a right turn at a particular junction. When they're close to the test, I'll give them a simple route and no matter what way they say they'll go, I'll tell them they have to use another route because the road is closed. The next student will have to find a third route and again I'll come up with a reason why they can't go that way. It's just to make them think.

Sarah - Marine Conservationist
I live by the coast and work from home. This involves responding to telephone enquiries, producing educational resources and setting up training courses. Occasionally, I go into our main office but generally I am on the coast. I also work with schools and study centres and run courses for coastal managers and those involved in making decisions about the fate of the seas.I do things like take them out to sea in a boat in an attempt to make them think more about the life underneath them. This often changes their views as it's very different from making decisions using a computer screen. I am extremely lucky because conservation is my hobby, so the job has many highs for me. The downside of the job is that I work for a charity, so there is a constant need for more money. This means I'm always looking for more resources and I'm not able to achieve everything I want.

Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
My work is pretty varied. I have to make sure that the publishing programme matches market requirements, and ensure that we keep stocks of 300 or so of the books that we publish. We have very high standards of information and content. We receive many letters from readers on issues such as the representation of international boundaries and these in particular require a careful response. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work as part of an enthusiastic group which makes the job that much more enjoyable. The negative side, as with many jobs, is that there is far too much administration to deal with, which leaves less time to work on the more interesting tasks such as product development and design.

","Four individuals elaborate on their respective careers. Lisa, serving as an Exhibition Programmes Organiser at the Science Museum, oversees the curation of temporary exhibitions, encompassing their planning, design, and promotion. She conducts preliminary research on the subject matter and engages with key figures in the field to delineate the principal themes and objectives, subsequently determining the selection of artifacts and imagery for display. To facilitate public understanding, she orchestrates interactive exhibits, workshops, and theatrical elements, while enlisting engineers and electricians to mitigate any potential hazards to visitors. In the pre-opening phase, she contributes to the design and composition of informational brochures and leaflets. Janet, an instructor for London taxi drivers, commences her day at 7:30 a.m. by reviewing financial accounts. She then generates requisite maps and documents for students mastering the 'runs' or routes essential for passing the licensing examination. By midday, approximately 50 pupils are engaged in devising the most efficient itineraries, incorporating correct one-way systems and turning maneuvers. Janet intervenes in instances of discord, such as debates over permissible turns at specific junctions. As examinations approach, she assigns straightforward routes and arbitrarily imposes simulated road closures, compelling candidates to conceptualize alternative pathways, thereby enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. Sarah, a marine conservationist, operates from her coastal residence, managing telephone inquiries, developing educational resources, and instituting training programmes. She sporadically attends the central office but predominantly conducts her activities along the shoreline, collaborating with educational institutions, study centres, and coastal managers. She facilitates maritime excursions to provide firsthand exposure to subaquatic ecosystems, which frequently reshapes stakeholders' decision-making paradigms. Sarah derives immense satisfaction from her vocation, as conservation aligns with her personal interests, though the charitable underpinnings necessitate perpetual fundraising, constraining the realisation of her aspirations. Chris, a publisher of maps and atlases, encounters considerable variety in his role, ensuring that the publishing agenda corresponds with market exigencies and maintaining inventories for roughly 300 publications. He adheres to stringent standards of accuracy and content, meticulously addressing reader correspondence, especially concerning the depiction of international boundaries. He deliberates on forthcoming initiatives and current sales metrics with co-publishers, finding the collaborative dynamics with an ardent team particularly gratifying. Conversely, the profusion of administrative responsibilities encroaches upon time allocated for more stimulating endeavours such as product innovation and design.","Four professionals expound upon their occupational endeavors. Lisa, in her capacity as an Exhibition Programmes Organiser at the Science Museum, is charged with the assemblage of transient exhibitions, entailing meticulous planning, design, and promotional strategies. She undertakes exhaustive preliminary research into the thematic content and consults with eminent authorities to crystallize the core themes and aims, thereby orchestrating the exhibition of pertinent objects and visual materials. To ensure public accessibility to the underlying concepts, she devises interactive installations, workshops, and theatrical performances, while coordinating with engineers and electricians to preclude any potential perils to attendees. Preceding the inauguration, she aids in the conceptualization and drafting of brochures and leaflets for dissemination. Janet, an educator for London taxi drivers, initiates her diurnal routine at 7:30 a.m. by scrutinizing financial accounts. Subsequently, she produces necessary cartographic and documentary resources for aspirants acquainting themselves with the 'runs' or routes imperative for licensure. By midday, a cohort of approximately 50 students is immersed in calculating the most expedient trajectories, incorporating appropriate unidirectional thoroughfares and turning maneuvers. Janet intercedes in contentious scenarios, such as disputes regarding the feasibility of specific turns at intersections. As candidates approach examination, she allocates elementary routes and contrives fictitious road closures, irrespective of proposed directions, thereby obliging them to formulate alternative itineraries and cultivate adaptive reasoning. Sarah, a marine conservationist, operates from her littoral abode, addressing telephonic inquiries, generating pedagogical materials, and establishing instructional curricula. She intermittently frequents the principal office but predominantly executes her duties along the coastline, engaging with scholastic institutions, research centres, and coastal administrators. She conducts nautical expeditions to immerse policymakers in the marine milieu, frequently precipitating a paradigm shift in their perspectives, distinct from computer-based decision-making. Sarah considers herself fortunate, as conservation constitutes her avocation, imbuing the role with numerous gratifications; however, the philanthropic nature of her employment necessitates incessant fundraising, thereby impeding the full actualization of her objectives. Chris, a publisher of cartographic works and atlases, encounters a heterogeneous array of responsibilities, ensuring the publishing schedule aligns with market dynamics and sustaining inventories for approximately 300 volumes. He upholds exacting standards of informational integrity and content, assiduously responding to epistolary communications from readers, particularly those pertaining to the representation of international demarcations. He engages in discourse with co-publishers regarding prospective ventures and extant sales figures, deriving considerable enjoyment from the fervent collective ethos. On the contrary, the surfeit of administrative duties detracts from more intellectually stimulating pursuits such as product evolution and design."

The restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef.
I believe everyone's given a chance in life. My son, Gary, was given his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I rushed over to look at the place. It was in a really bad state. It was perfect for what I had in mind.
Coming into this business made me recall my childhood. I can remember my mother going out to work in a factory and me being so upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We want time for family life.' My wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived over the restaurant in those days, and we always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. It's paid dividends with our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. Also, from a very early age they would come down and talk to our regular customers. It's given both of them a great start in life.
Gary was quite a lively child when he was really small. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven he thought he'd jump into it like a swimming pool, and he knocked himself out. When he was older he had to work for pocket money. He started off doing odd jobs and by the age of about ten he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had loads of money at school. He had discipline. He used to be up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out.
Gary wasn't very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. By the age of 15 he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair. So when he came to me and said, 'Dad, I've got to do work experience as part of my course at school,' I sent him to a friend of mine who's got a restaurant.
Gary recently took up playing the drums and now he has his own band. Goodness knows what will happen to the cooking if the music takes off. My advice to Gary would be: if you start chasing two hares, you end up catching neither, so chase the hare you know you're going to catch. He understood when I said to him: 'Gary, if you're going to get anywhere in life, you've got to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.'
Gary went to catering college at the age of 17, and on his first day he and the other new students -they're normally complete beginners - were given what's supposed to be a morning's work. But within an hour Gary had chopped all his vegetables, sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son for you! In the end, he was helping other people out.
None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you've got to work jolly hard for it, because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he's been given and grabbed hold of it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten per cent of what you've told them, you've got to be happy with that.

He believes that everyone receives an opportunity in life; for Gary, it was cooking, and for John, it was operating a restaurant. Upon hearing about the opportunity, John quickly inspected the place, which was in a poor state but ideal for his plans. Entering the business reminded him of his childhood, when his mother worked in a factory and he felt distressed from being left alone. With this in mind, John prioritized family time. His wife dedicated herself to childcare and accounting, while he ran the business. They resided above the restaurant and stressed the importance of shared meals, which benefited their children, Gary and Joe, making them confident.

He posits that each individual is afforded a chance in life; Gary's manifested in culinary arts, whilst his own entailed managing a restaurant. Upon learning of the opportunity, John expediently surveyed the premises, which were in a dilapidated condition yet perfectly aligned with his vision. Immersing himself in this venture evoked recollections of his youth, when his mother labored in a factory, leaving him disconsolate in solitude. Consequently, John resolved to safeguard family life, with his wife devoting herself to nurturing their children and overseeing accounts, as he steered the business. Residing above the establishment, they consistently emphasized communal meals, a practice that has yielded dividends in their offspring, Gary and Joe, who exude confidence. Moreover, from a tender age, they engaged with patrons, furnishing them with an exceptional commencement. Gary exhibited vivacity as a youngster; at approximately seven, he endeavored to leap into a corner bath as if it were a swimming pool, resulting in temporary unconsciousness. To procure pocket money, he commenced with miscellaneous chores and by the age of ten was routinely laboring in the kitchen on weekends, thereby amassing considerable funds and displaying discipline by awakening prematurely. John derived satisfaction from Gary's contributions to the familial enterprise. Despite academic limitations, Gary radiated proficiency in the kitchen; by fifteen, he paralleled the competence of seasoned staff and was periodically entrusted with supervision, orchestrating over a hundred meals, whence John discerned his innate flair for catering. When Gary necessitated work experience for his scholastic curriculum, John facilitated his placement at an associate's restaurant. Recently, Gary has embraced drumming and established his own band. John admonished that chasing dual pursuits risks accomplishing neither, urging Gary to focus on the assured path and attain success by thirty. At catering college, Gary executed a morning's assignment within an hour and proceeded to aid peers. The phenomenal success of Gary's televised cookery series is scarcely credible to the family, and John is profoundly proud, having perpetually inculcated the ethos that aspirations demand arduous effort. Gary has capitalized on his opportunity, and John acquiesces that even partial assimilation of paternal counsel suffices.","John Moore, the restaurateur, elucidates his rapport with his progeny Gary, the distinguished television chef, asserting that every person is endowed with a life opportunity; Gary's was culinary prowess, and his own was the stewardship of a restaurant. Upon apprisal of the prospect, John hastened to examine the locale, which was in an abysmal state yet impeccably suited to his aspirations. Engaging in this enterprise conjured reminiscences of his puerility, when his mother was employed in a factory, engendering in him a profound sense of desolation from solitude. Ergo, John was determined to prioritize familial cohesion, with his wife assiduously attending to child-rearing and fiscal management, while he administered the business. Inhabiting the premises above the restaurant, they invariably accentuated the significance of convivial repasts, an investment that has reaped substantial rewards in their sons, Gary and Joe, who are remarkably self-assured. Furthermore, from an early juncture, they would descend and converse with habitués, thereby securing an auspicious inception. Gary was an exuberant juvenile; at around seven years of age, he attempted to vault into a corner bath as though it were a swimming pool, rendering himself unconscious. To obtain discretionary funds, he initiated with sundry tasks and by the age of ten was consistently toiling in the kitchen on weekends, thus accruing ample pecuniary resources and exemplifying discipline by rousing before his father. John derived gratification from Gary's ancillary role in the family concern. Although not academically inclined, Gary evinced exceptional aptitude in the kitchen; by fifteen, he was on par with the adult personnel and was occasionally deputized to oversee operations, producing in excess of a hundred repasts, whereupon John recognized his inherent panache for gastronomy. When Gary required practical experience for his academic syllabus, John orchestrated his placement at a confidant's restaurant. Latterly, Gary has undertaken drumming and constituted his own ensemble. John imparted the adage that pursuing two hares culminates in capturing neither, exhorting Gary to concentrate on the certain quarry and achieve eminence by the age of thirty. At catering college, Gary consummated a morning's labor within an hour and subsequently assisted his cohorts. The prodigious success of Gary's televised culinary series is scarcely conceivable to the kin, and John is exultantly proud, having perpetually espoused the tenet that desiderata necessitate indefatigable exertion. Gary has adroitly seized his prospect, and John concedes that even a fractional incorporation of paternal wisdom is commendable."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean.
Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teach- ing, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots.'They are used to these conditions, which mean they can't stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. Adive can last for 16hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button.' The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. 'No one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.'
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but Ido it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"".' This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. 
The relief was incredible - we were still alive!'
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had

149,"Young Shoppers
Supermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar- coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff and, anyway, if I agree to their demands I feel I've been persuaded against my better judgement and I feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Yet I hate myself for saying no all the time, and I get cross and defensive in anticipation as we leave home. I do my best to avoid taking them shopping but then I worry that I'm not allowing them to have the experience they need in order to make their own choices. I can't win.'
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. More than PS150 million a year is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. That figure is likely to increase and it is in the supermarket aisles that the investment is most likely to be successful. For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up the difference.",B2,Shopping with children is hard. Children want many things. They see sweets and toys. They ask for them. Parents say no. Parents feel bad. They do not want to buy bad food. But children see ads on TV. Ads make children want things. Parents talk to children about food. Sometimes parents buy things for themselves but not for children. This is not fair. Supermarkets can help. They can move sweets away. They can have places for children to play.,"Shopping with children is difficult. Children often ask for things like sweets, cereals, or toys. Parents feel guilty if they say no or if they buy unhealthy items. Research shows children ask for something every two minutes in shops. A lot of money is spent on ads for children on TV. These ads make children want products. Parents try to teach children about healthy food, but it is hard. Some parents feel they always say no. Others are not consistent; they buy treats for themselves but not for their kids. Supermarkets could reduce problems by removing sweets from checkouts or adding play areas for children.","Shopping with children can be very stressful. One mother describes it as 'absolute murder' because her children constantly request items such as sugary cereals, Disney videos, or comics. She feels torn between refusing their demands and worrying about denying them necessary experiences. Studies indicate that children make purchase requests every two minutes during supermarket trips. Advertising aimed at children, mostly on television, spends over £150 million annually, influencing their desires. Parents often struggle to explain financial limits or health concerns, as ads are more persuasive. Experts note that parents compete with advertising, leading to frequent disappointments. While TV ads cannot directly tell children to ask parents to buy products, their goal is the same. Some parents manage by educating their children critically about ads, reducing conflicts. However, many admit to inconsistency, buying indulgent items for themselves while refusing similar treats for their children. Supermarkets could help by eliminating sweets at checkouts or providing childcare, potentially attracting more customers despite lower spending per trip.","Young Shoppers

For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up the difference.","Supermarket excursions with children are described by one mother as 'absolute murder,' owing to their incessant demands for products like sugar-coated cereals, Disney videos, and comics. She grapples with the dilemma of acquiescing to their requests against her better judgment or persistently refusing, which evokes guilt and anticipatory defensiveness. Research reveals that children solicit purchases every two minutes during shopping trips, with over £150 million annually allocated to child-targeted advertising, primarily on television, which proves highly effective in supermarket aisles. Children often fail to comprehend parental financial constraints or health rationales, finding them less compelling than emotionally charged advertisements. According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, while parents are generally concerned about providing healthy nourishment—albeit sometimes misinformed—they resent competing with the advertising industry and repeatedly disappointing their offspring. Although the Independent Television Commission bans explicit prompts for children to solicit purchases, the fundamental aim of advertising remains persuasive. A significant stressor for parents is the mental exertion required to adjudicate requests consistently. One mother mitigates conflict by critically discussing advertisements and product labels with her son, effectively reducing his demands. Nonetheless, parents frequently acknowledge inconsistency and hypocrisy, such as denying children sweets while indulging in luxuries themselves, often influenced by their mood. Supermarkets could ameliorate these tensions by removing confectionery from checkout areas or instituting supervised play facilities, potentially offsetting reduced expenditure with increased customer attraction from hassle-free shopping experiences.","The ordeal of supermarket shopping with children is characterized by one mother as 'absolute murder,' stemming from their relentless entreaties for items such as the latest sugar-coated breakfast cereals, Disney videos, and comics. She is ensnared in a paradox: yielding to their demands induces guilt over contravening her principles and purchasing suboptimal nourishment, while perpetual refusals foster self-reproach and preemptive irritability. Empirical studies indicate that children initiate purchase requests bimonthly during such excursions, with annual expenditures exceeding £150 million on advertising directed at juveniles, predominantly via television, which achieves peak efficacy within supermarket corridors. Juveniles often find parental elucidations regarding fiscal limitations or dental health unpersuasive when juxtaposed with the allure of emotionally manipulative marketing campaigns. Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance observes that although parents are typically conscientious about dietary health—albeit occasionally misguided—they deplore the adversarial dynamic with the advertising sector and the inevitability of recurrently disillusioning their progeny. The Independent Television Commission proscribes advertisers from explicitly instructing children to solicit purchases from parents; however, as Dibb notes, the intrinsic objective of advertising is to engender consumer desire, thereby achieving analogous outcomes. A principal source of parental strain is the cognitive labor involved in discerning which entreaties to countenance and which to deny. One mother has cultivated her son's skepticism toward advertisements through discursive analysis of products and labeling, thereby minimizing supermarket altercations. Conversely, parents frequently concede to capriciousness and duplicity, exemplified by proscribing sweets for their offspring while procuring indulgences like double cream and chocolate for themselves, often contingent upon their subjective disposition. Supermarkets possess the capacity to mitigate these conflicts by expurgating confectionery from checkout vicinities or establishing supervised recreational zones, which, notwithstanding potential decrements in per-customer expenditure, would likely augment patronage by facilitating unencumbered shopping endeavors."

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners.
This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m: to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says.
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.'
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now.
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m. Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.",B2,"Sarah works in France. She is a chalet girl.

This entailed forsaking their social circle, yet they have been fortunate in preserving these bonds, with numerous friends undertaking visits. Katherine Goodison, subsequent to a five-year stint as a company lawyer, established her own enterprise crafting hats for private clientele from her London flat.

154,"There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport overseas to discover that your baggage has been left behind. At best you will have to put up with wearing the clothes you stand up in for hours or days, until the airline reunites you with your luggage. At worst, you may be in a different climate zone, thousands of miles from home and forced to wear wholly unsuitable clothes.
Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. Even the best airlines slip up from time to time, and it is impossible for any carrier to guarantee that a passenger's checked luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when a journey calls for one or more changes of aircraft. 
The system works like this. Airlines insist on exaggerated check-in times (which require passengers to report to the airport at a given time before departure) designed to allow sufficient time for baggage to pass through the airport and be loaded on to the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time it takes to transfer between two flights. These, too, are exaggerated to allow for baggage transfers. 
In normal circumstances the system works well. But extra security checks at airports and problems with air traffic combine to cause delayed flights. All this can cause the baggage system to fail. Then there is the possibility of human error, or an accident in which the destination label is torn off. 
These problems can become severe at large transfer airports, known as 'hubs', because of the large number of bags that are processed. Last year, for example, London's Heathrow airport handled more than 41 million passengers, of whom nine million were changing planes. British Airways alone handled two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with most making the one-mile transfer between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European 
flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). 
Even efficient transfer airports, such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore and Zurich have their bad days. The risk of baggage being lost when changing planes is higher than average at certain airports. Even the United States has problems - Miami airport is well known for luggage going missing when transatlantic passengers make immediate connections for destinations in Latin America. 
You should choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If a change of plane is unavoidable, or makes your flight less expensive, then try to fly the same airline throughout. Try to allow more connecting time by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure you label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses. Don't forget to include the flight numbers. 
If, after all this, your luggage still goes missing, you must contact the appropriate airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report (PIR). This must be done before leaving the airport.

Airlines tell you to come to the airport early. This helps with bags. But sometimes, flights are late. People make mistakes. Labels on bags can come off. Big airports have many bags.

Airlines sometimes lose luggage, even if they are good. This can happen when you change planes during your journey. Airlines ask passengers to check in early to give time for baggage handling. They also set minimum connecting times for transferring between flights. Usually, this system works, but delayed flights, security checks, or human errors can cause problems. At large transfer airports, many bags are processed, so issues are more common.

","There is nothing more disheartening than arriving at an international airport only to find that your baggage has been misplaced. At best, you will endure wearing the same attire for an extended period until your luggage is recovered; at worst, you may find yourself in an unfamiliar climate, thousands of miles from home, clad in entirely inappropriate garments. While airlines seldom disclose the frequency of lost luggage, it is an inevitable occurrence for frequent flyers. Even the most reputable carriers occasionally err, and it is unfeasible for any airline to assure that checked baggage will accompany the passenger on the same aircraft, particularly on itineraries necessitating one or more plane changes. The operational framework entails exaggerated check-in and minimum connecting times to facilitate baggage handling through the airport system. Under normal conditions, this mechanism functions effectively; however, factors such as heightened security protocols, air traffic disruptions, and human fallibility can precipitate systemic failures. At major hub airports, the volume of processed baggage exacerbates these issues. To mitigate risks, passengers should prioritize direct flights, adhere to early check-in, maintain a single airline for connections, allocate ample transfer time, and ensure luggage is labeled internally and externally with addresses and flight details. Should luggage still go astray, it is imperative to liaise with airline personnel in the baggage reclaim area and submit a property irregularity report prior to departure from the airport.","There is nothing more dispiriting than arriving at a foreign airport to discover that one's baggage has been inadvertently left behind. In the most favourable scenario, one must tolerate donning the same garments for hours or even days until the airline effects a reunion with the luggage; in the least favourable, one might be situated in a disparate climatic zone, myriad miles from home, compelled to wear wholly unsuitable attire. Although airlines infrequently divulge the incidence of lost luggage, it is an incontrovertible reality that seasoned travellers will inevitably be parted from their belongings. Even the most exemplary carriers occasionally falter, and it is impracticable for any airline to guarantee that a passenger's checked baggage will invariably travel on the identical flight, especially when the journey necessitates one or more aircraft changes. The system operates on the principle of exaggerated check-in times and minimum connecting times, engineered to afford sufficient interval for baggage to traverse the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Under standard circumstances, this apparatus functions adeptly; nevertheless, augmented security measures, air traffic complications, and the potential for human error or mishaps such as detached destination labels can culminate in systemic breakdowns. At extensive transfer hubs, the prodigious quantity of processed baggage amplifies these predicaments. To ameliorate the hazard, passengers ought to elect non-stop flights whenever feasible, check in considerably antecedent to the stipulated time, endeavour to utilise a singular airline throughout the itinerary if connections are unavoidable, allocate more generous connecting time by selecting an earlier flight to the transfer point, and meticulously label luggage both internally and externally with domiciliary and destination addresses, inclusive of flight numbers. If, despite these precautions, luggage nevertheless goes missing, it is obligatory to engage the pertinent airline official in the baggage hall and complete a property irregularity report before egressing from the airport."
155,"A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. In this article we consider the move to a second job. We are not concerned with those looking for a second temporary position while hunting for a permanent job. Nor are we concerned with those leaving an unsatisfactory job within the first few weeks. Instead, we will be dealing with those of you taking a real step on the career ladder, choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions now that you have learnt your way around, acquired some skills and have some idea of where you want to go. 
What sort of job should you look for? Much depends on your long-term aim. You need to ask yourself whether you want to specialise in a particular field, work your way up to higher levels of responsibility or out of your current employment into a broader field. 
Whatever you decide, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. 
This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious [line 26: beginning] career planning. Most important, it should [line 26: end] extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility. Incidentally, if the travel bug is biting, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see [line 34: beginning] that you have got it out of your system, and [line 34: end] are not likely to go off again.

","A plethora of guidance is available for college leavers commencing their inaugural employment; however, this article deliberates upon the shift to a secondary position. We are not concerned with those pursuing an interim role whilst seeking permanent employment, nor with individuals exiting an unsatisfactory job precipitously. Instead, our focus is on those effecting a substantive progression on the career ladder, electing a role consonant with their aspirations now that they have acclimated, honed certain competencies, and formulated a clearer vocational direction. What manner of employment ought one to seek? This is largely contingent upon one's long-term ambitions. It is imperative to introspect regarding whether one desires to specialise in a particular domain, ascend hierarchically to echelons of greater responsibility, or transition from current employment into a more expansive field. Irrespective of one's resolution, the selection of a second occupation warrants meticulous consideration, with an intention to remain therein for a duration of two to three years. This position will be subjected to rigorous examination when one submits applications for subsequent roles; it should evince deliberate career strategizing. Crucially, it must serve to extend one's capabilities, foster professional growth, and confer escalating responsibilities. Incidentally, should the wanderlust prove compelling, the present juncture is opportune for embarking upon travels. Upon return, one can undertake temporary engagements, recommence one's career trajectory, and subsequently secure a second position. Prospective employers will be assuaged to observe that one has satiated the propensity for peregrination and is improbable to abscond anew. Juliette Davidson devoted her initial post-collegiate year to employment with three solicitors. It constituted an ideal inaugural role in that the individuals were exceedingly supportive; she was incrementally initiated into the duties, mastered office protocols, and augmented her word processing proficiencies. Nonetheless, opportunities for advancement were nonexistent. Eventually, she tendered her resignation, procured an air ticket, and journeyed for a annum. Presently, Juliette serves as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. Over the course of two and a half years, she has augmented her competencies substantially, and her responsibilities have burgeoned. From the inception, her superior was fervently dedicated to her development. Although her official designation remains unaltered, her functions have transmuted from predominantly clerical tasks such as typing and telephony to encompassing the majority of correspondence and budgetary management. Additionally, she addresses a spectrum of inquiries, ranging from those posed by chairmen of substantial corporations to individuals inquiring about entrepreneurial inception. Brenda integrates her into all her undertakings while also delegating specific projects and events for her to orchestrate.","An abundance of counsel is proffered to college graduates embarking upon their initial professional engagements; this treatise, however, contemplates the transition to a subsequent employment. We eschew consideration of those procuring a second provisional post whilst in pursuit of a permanent vocation, as well as individuals departing from an unsatisfactory situation within the nascent weeks. Rather, we address those effectuating a veritable ascent on the career trajectory, selecting a role that dovetails with their ambitions subsequent to having familiarised themselves with the professional milieu, acquired a repertoire of skills, and crystallised their vocational aspirations. What genre of occupation ought one to pursue? This is predominantly predicated upon one's long-term objectives. One must engage in introspection to ascertain whether the aim is to specialise within a particular sphere, ascend to strata of heightened accountability, or diverge from current employment into a more expansive domain. Regardless of one's determination, the election of a second position mandates scrupulous deliberation, with an envisaged tenure of two to three years. This role will be subjected to meticulous scrutiny upon submission of applications for ensuing employments; it should manifest evidence of assiduous career orchestration. Paramountly, it ought to challenge one's capacities, catalyse professional evolution, and bestow incrementally greater responsibilities. Parenthetically, if an insatiable desire for travel prevails, the present constitutes a propitious moment to decamp and journey. Upon repatriation, one can engage in interim labour, resume one's professional course, and thereafter secure a secondary position. Prospective employers will be gratified to discern that one has exorcised the impetus for itinerancy and is improbable to decamp anew. Juliette Davidson allocated her inaugural annum post-graduation to employment with three solicitors. It epitomised an exemplary initial role insofar as the personnel were exceedingly supportive; she was gradually inducted into the responsibilities, mastered office protocols, and refined her word processing acumen. Nevertheless, scope for advancement was absent. Ultimately, she rendered her notice, acquired an air passage, and sojourned for a twelvemonth. Currently, Juliette functions as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. Over a span of two and a half years, she has substantially augmented her capabilities, and her remit has undergone significant expansion. From the outset, her superior was ardently committed to her professional cultivation. Although her titular designation remains invariant, her duties have evolved from principally comprising typing and telephonic functions to encompassing the bulk of correspondence and fiscal planning. Furthermore, she adjudicates a panoply of inquiries, emanating from chairmen of major corporations to aspirants seeking guidance on entrepreneurial inception. Brenda immerses her in the entirety of her endeavours whilst also entrusting her with discrete projects and events to coordinate."
156,"Bitter water hits the big time

Chocolate, which has its origins in South America, is now part of a multi-million pound worldwide business. 

At Easter, British people spend over PS230 million on chocolate. A massive eight per cent of all chocolate is bought at this time. 
Only at Christmas do people eat more of the cocoa-based foodstuffs. Although the large-scale industrial production of chocolate began in the last century, the cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec and Mayan civilisations of Central America over three thousand years ago. 
The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant which is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is melon-sized and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried they become cacao beans, which can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans. 
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also used them to make a drink called xocoatl. This is from the word in the Aztec language, Nahuatl, meaning 'bitter water'. In Aztec times the chocolate drink was flavoured with spices and used on ceremonial occasions and for welcoming visitors. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe did not spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. 
Until the last century, the chocolate drink was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten of the Netherlands invented chocolate powder. This was made by extracting most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. 
The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to produce a solid block that you could eat. A Swiss company then introduced milk solids to the process which gave us milk chocolate. 
At the turn of the century, the British chocolate market was dominated by French companies. In 1879 the English company Cadbury even named their Birmingham factory Bournville (ville is the French word for town) in the hope that a little French glamour would rub off. But then came Cadbury's famous Dairy Milk bar which began life as Dairymaid in 1905. Clever advertising which associated it with the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside quickly established the bar as a rival to the more decadent French brands. 
It seems that, for the time being at least, chocolate intake in Britain has stabilised at about four bars each week. This has forced manufacturers to look for new ways to attract customers.
The latest marketing trick is the so-called 'extended line'. This is when the humble chocolate bar becomes an ice cream, a soft drink or a dessert, to tempt chocoholics who have grown tired of conventional snacks. 
At the other end of the production process, cacao farmers are still feeling the effects of a crash in cocoa bean prices at the end of the 1980s. As most cacao farmers operate on a very small scale, many were forced out of business. Perhaps you could spare a thought for them as you munch your next chocolate bars. ",B2,"Chocolate comes from South America. It is a big business all over the world. People in Britain buy a lot of chocolate at Easter. They buy even more at Christmas. The cacao plant is a tree. It grows in hot places. Its fruit has seeds. The seeds are used to make chocolate. Long ago, the Aztecs used the seeds as money. They made a drink from them. The Spanish added sugar to the drink. Later, people made chocolate powder. Then, they made solid chocolate bars. Milk chocolate was made in Switzerland. In Britain, Cadbury made a popular chocolate bar. Now, people eat about four chocolate bars each week. Companies make new things like chocolate ice cream to sell more. Cacao farmers have problems because seed prices are low.","Chocolate started in South America and is now a huge global industry. At Easter, British people spend over £230 million on chocolate, and only Christmas sees more chocolate sales. The cacao tree grows in tropical regions like Africa and Central America. Its fruit contains seeds that become cocoa beans for making chocolate. Historically, the Aztecs used these beans as currency and made a bitter drink called xocoatl. The Spanish improved the drink by adding sugar, and it spread to Europe. In the 19th century, chocolate powder and solid bars were invented, leading to milk chocolate. In Britain, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar became popular through advertising. Today, people in Britain eat around four chocolate bars per week, so companies create new products like chocolate desserts. However, cacao farmers struggle due to low bean prices.","Chocolate, originating in South America, is now a multi-million pound global business. In Britain, over £230 million is spent on chocolate at Easter, accounting for eight percent of annual sales, with only Christmas exceeding this consumption.

The Aztecs used these beans as money and made a ceremonial drink called xocoatl, meaning 'bitter water'. The Spanish adapted it with sugar, and it later spread across Europe. Key developments include the invention of chocolate powder in 1826 and the first solid chocolate bar in 1847, followed by milk chocolate. In Britain, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar rivaled French brands through effective marketing. Currently, chocolate consumption has stabilized, prompting manufacturers to innovate with products like chocolate ice cream, while cacao farmers face challenges from price crashes.","Bitter water hits the big time

At Easter, British expenditure on chocolate surpasses £230 million, representing a significant eight percent of annual sales, eclipsed solely by Christmas consumption. The cacao tree, an evergreen tropical plant initially cultivated by Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations over three millennia ago, bears melon-sized fruits harboring 20-40 seeds that, upon drying, become cocoa beans—the quintessential ingredient for chocolate production. Historically, the Aztecs utilized these beans as monetary units and prepared a ceremonial libation called xocoatl, from the Nahuatl term meaning 'bitter water', which the Spanish ameliorated with cinnamon and sugar, though its proliferation throughout Europe was delayed by a century. The late 17th century witnessed the advent of chocolate houses in European capitals. Transformative milestones encompassed CJ van Houten's 1826 invention of chocolate powder via cocoa butter extraction and the 1847 creation of the first edible solid chocolate bar by Fry and Sons, subsequently enhanced with milk solids by Swiss innovators. In Britain, Cadbury's strategic nomenclature of their Bournville factory and the launch of the Dairy Milk bar, promoted through advertising emphasizing pastoral health benefits, enabled it to rival more indulgent French marques. Contemporary chocolate intake in Britain has stabilized at roughly four bars per week, impelling manufacturers to devise 'extended line' products, such as chocolate-infused ice creams and desserts, to entice jaded consumers. Concurrently, cacao farmers endure the lingering effects of the late 1980s price crash, exacerbating challenges for small-scale cultivators."

On the very last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting to catch the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot more people waiting than I had expected. That airy, light, clean, polished feeling I generally got in the station had been lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage stuffed the benches, and swarms of college kids littered the floor with their bags.
A grey-haired man was walking around speaking to different strangers one by one. Well-off, you could tell: tanned skin, nice sweater, soft, beige car-coat. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I had been thinking I wouldn't mind talking to her myself. The man said, 'Would you by any chance be travelling to Philadelphia?'
'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?'
'No, New York, but I'll be ...'
'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and he moved toward the next bench.
Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to
Philadelphia?' When the woman told him, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say a thing, just marched on down the row to one of the matched-luggage couples. I straightened up from my pillar and drifted closer, looking toward the platform as if I had my mind on the train.
Well, I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't, of course.
No doubt, I struck him as unreliable. He just glanced quickly at me and then swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. By now he was looking seriously stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!'
She lowered her book. She was thirtyish, maybe thirty-five - older than I was, anyhow. A school- teacher sort. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Why, yes, I am.'
'Then could I ask you a favour?'
I stopped several feet away and frowned down at my left wrist. (Never mind that I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could sense how she went on guard. The man must have sensed it too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!'
They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples hauling their wheeled bags behind them like big pets on leashes. Next I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. So I put her on a train this morning, stopping for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife in a state. She hardly said ""hello"" to me. You see my daughter'd forgotten her passport. She'd telephoned home from the station in Philadelphia; didn't know what to do next.'
The woman clucked sympathetically. I'd have kept quiet myself. Waited to find out where he was heading with this.
'So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get somebody here to carry up her passport.'
A likely story! Why didn't he go himself, if this was such an emergency?
'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked him.
'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.'
This seemed like a pretty poor excuse, if you want my honest opinion. Also, it exceeded the amount of bad luck that one family could expect. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been the logical choice, but one of those padded envelopes the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked to be stapled shut besides. Watch yourself, lady, I said silently.",B2,"It was the last day of a bad year. I was in a train station in Baltimore. I was waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were many people. An old man with grey hair was talking to people. He had nice clothes. He asked a woman with long blond hair if she was going to Philadelphia. She said no. He asked an old lady. She said no. I was going to Philadelphia, but he did not ask me. I think he thought I was not good to help. He looked worried. He asked another woman. She was reading a book. She said yes, she was going to Philadelphia. He asked her for a favor. He said his daughter was in Philadelphia. She forgot her passport. He wanted the woman to take the passport to her. He said his wife was in a wheelchair, so he could not go. I thought his story was not true. The envelope was big and padded. I was worried for the woman.","On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station, leaning on a pillar and waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. The station was very crowded with many people, including old couples and college students. A well-dressed, grey-haired man was walking around and asking strangers if they were going to Philadelphia. He did not ask me, probably because I seemed unreliable. He looked stressed. Finally, he found a woman who was going to Philadelphia and asked her for a favor. He explained that his daughter had forgotten her passport in Philadelphia and was flying abroad. He could not go himself because his wife was in a wheelchair. He gave her a padded envelope to take to his daughter. I thought his story might not be true and felt concerned for the woman.","On the final day of a difficult year, I was standing by a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting to board the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. The station was unusually crowded, losing its usual clean and airy atmosphere. A tanned, well-dressed man with grey hair was approaching various strangers, inquiring if they were traveling to Philadelphia. He skipped me, likely judging me as untrustworthy. After several refusals, he found a woman in her thirties who confirmed she was headed to Philadelphia and asked her for assistance. He recounted that his daughter had left her passport in Philadelphia before an international flight and that he couldn't deliver it himself due to his wife's wheelchair confinement. He handed her a stapled, padded envelope. I remained skeptical of his story and grew wary for the woman's safety.","No Title

The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been the logical choice, but one of those padded envelopes the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked to be stapled shut besides. Watch yourself, lady, I said silently.","On the concluding day of an adverse year, I found myself leaning against a pillar within the Baltimore railway station, anticipating the 10:10 departure to Philadelphia. The station was inundated with an unexpected multitude, diminishing its typically pristine and luminous ambiance. A affluent-appearing, grey-haired gentleman, characterized by his tan complexion and refined attire, was systematically interrogating strangers about their destination to Philadelphia. He deliberately avoided me, presumably deeming me unreliable. His demeanor grew increasingly agitated until he encountered a woman in her mid-thirties, who affirmed her Philadelphia-bound itinerary. He solicited her aid, elucidating that his daughter had inadvertently left her passport in Philadelphia prior to an overseas academic endeavor and that his wife's immobility in a wheelchair precluded his personal intervention. He proffered a securely stapled, padded envelope, arousing my profound suspicion and concern for the woman's welfare.","On the ultimate day of a calamitous year, I was reclining against a pillar in the Baltimore railway terminus, awaiting the 10:10 service to Philadelphia. The concourse was thronged with an unanticipated assembly, effacing its customary ethereal and polished aura. A gentleman of advanced years, evidencing affluence through his bronzed skin and sartorial elegance, was meticulously canvassing disparate strangers to ascertain their travel to Philadelphia. He conspicuously eschewed engaging me, likely inferring my unreliability. His countenance betrayed mounting distress until he accosted a woman of approximately thirty-five years, who corroborated her Philadelphia destination. He implored her assistance, expounding that his daughter had omitted her passport in Philadelphia before an imminent international scholarly sojourn and that his wife's confinement to a wheelchair obviated his direct involvement. He tendered a meticulously stapled, cushioned envelope, inciting my profound skepticism and apprehension for the woman's security."
158,"Where I get my energy

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the full to tell us how they do it. 

A. Jeanette Kupfermann

Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning, I get tremendous energy. Anything to do with rhythm gives me energy, too - at the moment I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive and energising. I think you can feel drained if you're bored, maybe feeling life is pointless. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' 

B. Linda Kelsey

Magazine editor: 'I have so much work to do but I enjoy it all - I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even though you may be feeling tired. I need a fair bit of sleep so when I do get it I feel really good. When I'm 
running at six hours' sleep a night, I feel a bit wet. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's finding the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and I try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've done exercise, my spirits rise amazingly. I get very low patches in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's probably good to eat something then.' 

C. Annie Nightingale

Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives, grab the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You've got to achieve things and set yourself various goals. I enjoy what I do and the last two years have been very exciting. In my line of business there are lots of lively young people and you can't help being affected by that. I love tearing around the place on jobs, having a mad life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photographs but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them processed and can't wait to get them back. 
I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and it's a good release for my mind when I'm doing a lot of travelling.' 

D. Floella Benjamin

Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family and I think that being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids, they give out so much and have an inbuilt resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered off by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill you get when they smile back. It's far better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' 

E. Deborah Moggach

Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything in the world is making a garden out of complete wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I smashed up all the concrete and dug in loads of soil. It was far better than any amount of workouts or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing that somebody wants to read what I'm writing - I find it difficult to write in a void. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm found, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private property,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' 

F. Katherine Monblot

Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be a member of various committees and resented the demands they made on my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so direct it into the things that are most important to you.' 

",B2,Emma Marsden asked six women how they get energy. Jeanette Kupfermann: I get energy from new things and dance. Linda Kelsey: I get energy from work and exercise. I need sleep.

","Emma Marsden inquired of six accomplished women regarding the sources of their vitality. Jeanette Kupfermann, a journalist and author, posits that her energy stems from exhilaration derived from confronting challenges and acquiring new knowledge; she finds rhythmic activities like flamenco dancing particularly invigorating and contends that boredom can lead to depletion, whereas efficacy, even in minor endeavors, fosters energy. Linda Kelsey, a magazine editor, derives substantial energy from her professional engagements, which she does not perceive as burdensome. She acknowledges the necessity of adequate sleep and the energizing effects of exercise, such as yoga and home workouts, which ameliorate her mood, though she occasionally experiences afternoon slumps mitigated by snacking. Annie Nightingale, a disc jockey, ascribes her vigor to innate enthusiasm and an optimistic disposition, eschewing negativity. She advocates for seizing the moment, setting goals, and immersing oneself in dynamic environments; her pastimes include photography and composing song lyrics as mental diversions during travel. Floella Benjamin, an author and children's television presenter, attributes her energy to heartfelt involvement in her work and familial interactions, emphasizing the positive impact of communication and resilience in children. While she maintains healthy habits, she forgoes structured exercise, preferring active play. Deborah Moggach, an author and playwright, experiences heightened energy through transformative gardening endeavors and the anticipation of an audience for her literary works; she also indulges in clandestine explorations of natural settings, appreciating the childlike thrill. Katherine Monblot, a therapist, asserts that energy is optimized by focusing on respected interests and avoiding draining commitments, as she learned from previous committee involvements that squandered her vitality.","Emma Marsden solicited insights from six women who lead fulsome lives on the origins of their dynamism. Jeanette Kupfermann, a journalist and author, elucidates that her energy is galvanized by intellectual stimulation and novel challenges; she finds profound vitality in absorptive learning and rhythmic pursuits such as flamenco dancing, which she describes as expressive and energizing. She theorizes that ennui and a sense of purposelessness can be draining, whereas making even minuscule contributions to the world invigorates her. Linda Kelsey, a magazine editor, professes an ardent enjoyment of her professional duties, which precludes them from being onerous. She underscores the indispensability of sufficient sleep and the paradoxical challenge of mustering energy for exercise, yet attests that yoga sessions and workout regimens remarkably elevate her spirits, counteracting afternoon lethargy that she alleviates with nutritional intake. Annie Nightingale, a disc jockey, attributes her indefatigability to an intrinsic zeal and a resolutely positive mindset, disdaining negativism. She embraces a carpe diem philosophy, advocating for goal-setting and reveling in the vibrancy of her industry's youthful milieu; her avocations include photography and whimsical songwriting, serving as cerebral outlets during peripatetic episodes. Floella Benjamin, an author and children's television presenter, derives energy from deeply held convictions in her vocational and domestic roles, highlighting the synergistic effects of positivity and interpersonal exchanges, such as reciprocal smiling. Although she adheres to salutary habits, she eschews formal exercise regimens, finding vigor in playful interactions with children. Deborah Moggach, an author and playwright, experiences an effusion of energy from metamorphic gardening projects and the motivational impetus of an engaged readership; her proclivity for trespassing into bucolic settings evokes a juvenile exuberance that she cherishes. Katherine Monblot, a therapist, posits that energy conservation and enhancement necessitate a focus on esteemed pursuits and the eschewal of perfunctory obligations, as evinced by her prior disenchantment with committee work that dissipated her reserves."
159,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE 

When you first enter the Model Village it is hard to imagine that a few short years ago this was a piece of waste ground, flat and completely overgrown with brambles. For years it had been considered a worthless piece of land. The careful planning and hard work of one man, supported unfailingly by his wife, turned this piece of ground into the masterpiece you see today. 
Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved during the construction of the village to change a flat site into the sculptured landscape you see today. Although bulldozers and digging machines helped to transform the land, it also involved an enormous amount of hard labour. Once shaped, approximately 1,000 tonnes of top soil were brought in and laid over it to create the lawns, flower-beds and rockeries. 
In the creation of the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These had to be carefully selected for the area. Only those plants which were able to tolerate the salt-laden atmosphere so close to the sea could be used. They also had to stand up to the severe winter gales in this very exposed position. Most of the plants were provided by local garden centres but some came from as far away as Canada and New Zealand. 
The whole village was conceived by Colin Sims and the models, over 100, were individually made by him over a period of nine years from when the village was first opened, in 1972. The models are constructed from a variety of materials - stone, concrete, specially treated wood and plastics - to withstand all kinds of weather. Initially, Colin had to seek considerable assistance from experts who explained to him how various materials would stand up to years of changing weather. But very soon he became an expert himself.
You will soon notice that a constant scale has been strictly adhered to and that attention has been paid to even the smallest detail on the models. This has been achieved by patience and the development of unique construction techniques. The Model Village has proved to be a very popular attraction and is noted for its high standard of workmanship and maintenance. The techniques used to construct such true-to-life models have since been used in other model villages around England and have even been included in some courses at colleges where modelling can be studied. 
All model buildings you will see in the village portray traditional British architectural forms and are not based strictly on one particular place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. This is a typical 13th century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls. It is based on the style of manor houses commonly found in the West Country. As you walk round the village you will also notice the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo and mini golf course, the latter being the most recent addition to the village.
We ask you to keep to the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; a slip on your part can result in hours of repair work for us. Photography is allowed from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. To further your enjoyment of the Model Village, you will see buttons mounted in front of some of the working models. Press these and you will make the models operate. 
At the end of your visit we would welcome any comments you might have. New models are being planned all the time and any new ideas will help us design a more varied and interesting display. We would also like to know which models, if any, you thought were not up to the standard of the rest of the village. We are continually replacing and updating the models and we need to know which ones require some attention. We hope you enjoy your visit and we look forward to seeing you another day.

Don't forget to tell your friends about it. ","Upon entering the Model Village, it is scarcely conceivable that merely a few years prior, this site constituted a derelict tract of land, level and densely overgrown with brambles, long deemed valueless. Through meticulous planning and arduous labor by one individual, steadfastly supported by his spouse, this terrain was metamorphosed into the exquisite masterpiece presently on display. The construction entailed the relocation of many thousands of tons of soil and clay to transmute the flat expanse into the intricately sculpted landscape observable today, facilitated by bulldozers and excavating machinery, yet also demanding prodigious manual effort. Subsequent to shaping, approximately 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were imported and deployed to establish lawns, flower-beds, and rockeries. In the village's creation, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, meticulously chosen for their capacity to endure the salt-saturated maritime atmosphere and resist the violent winter gales characteristic of this exposed locale. While the majority of flora originated from local garden centres, some specimens were procured from as distant as Canada and New Zealand. The entire village was conceptualized by Colin Sims, who fabricated over 100 models individually over a nine-year period commencing in 1972, utilizing an assortment of materials—including stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—engineered to withstand diverse meteorological conditions. Initially, Colin solicited substantial guidance from specialists regarding material resilience, but he rapidly attained expertise autonomously. Observers will note that a uniform scale has been rigorously maintained, with scrupulous attention devoted to minutiae, accomplishments derived from perseverance and the evolution of distinctive construction methodologies. The Model Village has garnered significant popularity and is acclaimed for its superior craftsmanship and upkeep; the techniques employed have subsequently been implemented in other model villages across England and incorporated into academic curricula for modelling studies. All edifices within the village epitomize traditional British architectural styles, eschewing strict replication of any singular structure. Among the most imposing is the Manor House, a quintessential 13th-century stone edifice featuring a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by West Country manorial designs. Additionally, the village encompasses a castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, the latter being the most recent augmentation. Visitors are enjoined to remain on designated paths and refrain from contacting the models, as inadvertent mishaps could necessitate extensive restorative work. Photography is sanctioned exclusively from the pathways, and canines are permitted provided they are on short leads. To augment visitor engagement, buttons positioned before operational models may be activated to initiate their functions. Concluding the visit, we solicit any commentary or suggestions, as new models are perpetually in development, and insights aid in crafting a more diverse and captivating exhibition. We also seek identification of any models perceived as substandard, facilitating ongoing replacement and refinement. It is our earnest hope that you derive pleasure from your sojourn and anticipate your future return; kindly disseminate your experience to acquaintances.","Welcoming you to the Model Village, it is scarcely imaginable that a mere few years ago, this locale was an expanse of waste ground, uniformly flat and profusely overgrown with brambles, perennially regarded as an inconsequential parcel of land. The transformation into the present masterpiece was effected through the fastidious planning and indefatigable labor of one man, unwaveringly bolstered by his spouse. This endeavor necessitated the displacement of many thousands of tons of soil and clay to reconfigure the topographically inert site into the artistically contoured landscape now evident, a process augmented by bulldozers and excavatory machinery yet concomitantly reliant upon an immense quantum of manual exertion. Post-shaping, approximately 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were introduced and meticulously laid to cultivate lawns, flower-beds, and rockeries. In the village's genesis, hundreds of trees and shrubs were implanted, assiduously selected for their tolerance to the saline-laden atmosphere proximate to the sea and their resilience against the severe winter gales endemic to this exposed situation. While the preponderance of vegetation was supplied by local garden centres, certain specimens were sourced from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. The entire conception of the village is attributable to Colin Sims, who individually fabricated over 100 models over a nine-year span initiating in 1972, employing a panoply of materials—stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—designed to endure all climatic vicissitudes. Initially, Colin availed himself of considerable expert consultation regarding the durability of various materials under protracted exposure to the elements, but he expeditiously attained autodidactic mastery. A consistent scale has been scrupulously adhered to, with meticulous attention conferred upon even the most minuscule details, achievements predicated upon patience and the development of idiosyncratic construction techniques. The Model Village has proven to be a perennially popular attraction, esteemed for its exemplary workmanship and maintenance; the methodologies devised have since been extrapolated to other model villages throughout England and integrated into certain collegiate curricula where modelling is studied. All architectural representations within the village encapsulate traditional British forms, eschewing strict adherence to any particular edifice or locale. Among the most arresting structures is the Manor House, a prototypical 13th-century stone construction featuring a brick tower and stone walls, predicated on the stylistic conventions of manor houses prevalent in the West Country. As one perambulates the village, additional features include a castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, the latter constituting the most recent adjunct. We implore visitors to confine themselves to the pathways and abstain from contacting the models, as an inadvertent lapse could precipitate hours of restorative labor. Photography is permitted solely from the pathways, and canines are welcome provided they are restrained by short leads. To further enrich your experience, buttons mounted before operational models may be engaged to actuate their mechanisms. Upon concluding your visit, we earnestly solicit any commentary or novel ideas, as new models are incessantly in the planning stages, and such input facilitates the design of a more variegated and intriguing display. We are also keen to ascertain which models, if any, are perceived as not commensurate with the village's overall standard, as we are perpetually engaged in replacing and updating exhibits. It is our fervent hope that you relish your visit and that we may have the pleasure of your company on a future occasion; do not neglect to apprise your acquaintances of this attraction."
160,"HAPPY HUNTING GROUND 

We're 'animal people' who enjoy the company of all kinds of creatures. Consider this typical chain of events, leading to total confusion, which began one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at work with the news that she had found a wonderful pine snake. 
'Can we keep him?' she cried. I said 'Yes, but only overnight.' We had set up a special tank for just such passers-through, overnight being long enough to admire and look them up in our well-used natural history book. 
I was late getting home. I hurriedly put a pot on to boil just as screams of 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' came from my sons' bedroom. I leapt to it. 
The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day present. (I've [line 23: beginning] heard that some mothers get [line 23: end] perfume.) Domino, with mouse feet waving from his jaws, ran round and round the bedroom that was crowded with furniture and children. 
Looking for a way out so he could enjoy his catch, Domino had so far avoided the forest of waving arms. I threw myself into the confusion and promptly tripped over something or someone to find myself on the floor. 
As I thought about dropping my full weight on Domino when he next came past, my eyes locked on the snake. It had escaped - or, more correctly, was escaping. It was pouring itself up and out and off the table and all over the floor. I crouched like a rabbit at the approach of its bullish head, and long powerful body. 
The snake and I were now both being jumped over by cat/mouse/kids in a screaming, leaping, hissing mass - the snake striking at every moment, the dog barking wildly. 
The pot boiled over in the kitchen and I raced to shut off the gas, returning to the battle with new strength. This time I successfully captured Domino by the tail, and pulled the small, damp and miraculously uninjured mouse from his growling jaws. Incidentally, the same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times during its lifetime, but eventually died of old age. 
[line 60: beginning] Encouraged by my success with the [line 60: end] cat, I looked the snake over for weak points. It didn't have any. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking backwards and forwards, but without a flute. Gradually the snake relaxed enough to drop its head on to its piled-up body, but its eyes still shone with suspicion. I eventually ever-so-slowly eased my hands beneath the piled-up snake and gradually raised myself to a kneeling position, then I stood up and walked to the very end of the garden where I gave the snake the choice of living happily ever after on the garden shed by pointing it in the direction of a handy tree. 
But when I finally gathered enough courage to release the snake's head - fully expecting it to swing instantly around to crush my face in its powerful jaws - it slid away from the tree and up over my shoulders where, like a colourful leathery shawl, it gave every sign of making itself comfortable for the winter. 
We stood in the gathering dusk, four young children, Mum and the snake. DJ, my eldest, broke the heavy silence with a scientific explanation: 'You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and fat and warm, and the shed isn't.' I had the children gather at the snake's tail end and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly and unwillingly it did so. Without a backward glance, the snake travelled smoothly up the wall to disappear over the now night-shadowed roof. 
As the last tiny bit of tail disappeared from our property, three-year old Clay sighed and said it for all of us: 'Boy, that was one big snake!' 
",B2,"We like animals. One day, my daughter called me. She found a snake. She asked, 'Can we keep it?' I said, 'Yes, but only for one night.' We have a tank for animals that stay for a short time. I came home late. I started to cook. Then I heard my sons shout, 'Help!' I ran to their room. The cat had a mouse in its mouth. The cat ran around the room. I tried to catch the cat, but I fell. I saw the snake. It was getting out of its tank. The snake moved on the floor. I was scared. The cat, mouse, kids, and snake were all moving fast. The dog was barking. The pot on the stove was boiling over. I turned off the stove. I went back and caught the cat. I took the mouse from the cat. The mouse was okay. Later, the cat caught the mouse three more times, but the mouse died when it was old. Then, I looked at the snake. I sat on the floor and moved slowly. The snake became calm. I picked up the snake carefully. I walked to the garden. I wanted the snake to go to a tree. But the snake went onto my shoulders. It looked like it wanted to stay there. My children and I were in the garden. My oldest child said, 'You are warm and fat, Mum. The shed is not.' I told the children to help move the snake. Slowly, the snake went up the wall and left. My young son said, 'That was a big snake!'","We are people who love animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She said she found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, 'Can we keep it?' I replied, 'Yes, but only for one night.' We have a special tank for animals that visit us for a short time. I came home late. I started to boil a pot of water. Suddenly, I heard screams from my sons' room: 'Mother, help! Do something!' I ran quickly to the room. The problem was with our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the crowded room. I tried to catch Domino but tripped and fell. Then I saw the snake. It had escaped from its tank and was moving across the floor. I felt afraid as it came near me. In the room, the cat, mouse, children, and snake were all moving and making noise. The dog was barking loudly. The pot in the kitchen boiled over, so I ran to turn off the gas. I returned and caught Domino by the tail. I pulled the mouse from his mouth; it was wet but not hurt. Later, the cat caught that mouse three more times, but the mouse died when it was old. Feeling brave, I looked at the snake to find a way to catch it. I sat on the floor and rocked slowly. The snake relaxed and put its head down. I slowly put my hands under the snake and stood up. I carried it to the garden and pointed it towards a tree. But when I let go, the snake slid over my shoulders instead. It seemed to want to stay there for warmth. My children and I stood outside as it got dark. My oldest son, DJ, said, 'Mum, you are nice and warm, but the shed is cold.' I had the children help me encourage the snake to leave. It slowly went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. My three-year-old son, Clay, sighed and said, 'That was one big snake!'","We are animal lovers who enjoy being around all sorts of creatures. Consider this typical series of events that led to complete chaos one afternoon. My daughter phoned me at work to announce she had discovered a wonderful pine snake. She excitedly asked, 'Can we keep him?' I agreed but said only for the night. We have a special tank set up for such temporary visitors, as overnight is sufficient to admire them and look them up in our well-used natural history book. I arrived home late and hurriedly put a pot on to boil. Just then, screams of 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' came from my sons' bedroom. I rushed in immediately. The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse, which had been given to me as a Mother's Day present. Domino had the mouse's feet visible from his jaws and was running circles around the furniture-filled room, trying to avoid the children's waving arms so he could enjoy his catch. I threw myself into the confusion but tripped over something or someone and ended up on the floor. As I considered dropping my weight on Domino when he passed by, I noticed the snake. It had escaped—or more accurately, was in the process of escaping—pouring itself off the table and onto the floor. I crouched nervously as its bullish head and long, powerful body approached. The snake and I were both being jumped over by the cat, mouse, and kids in a screaming, leaping, hissing mass, with the snake striking repeatedly and the dog barking wildly. The pot boiled over in the kitchen, so I raced to shut off the gas and returned to the battle with renewed energy. This time, I successfully grabbed Domino by the tail and extracted the small, damp, and miraculously unharmed mouse from his growling jaws. By the way, that same mouse was caught by the cat three more times in its life but eventually died of old age. Encouraged by my success with the cat, I assessed the snake for vulnerabilities but found none. Eventually, I sat on the floor like a snake charmer, rocking back and forth without a flute. Gradually, the snake relaxed enough to rest its head on its coiled body, though its eyes remained suspicious. I slowly eased my hands under the snake, raised myself to a kneeling position, stood up, and walked to the far end of the garden. There, I directed the snake toward a handy tree, hoping it would choose to live happily ever after on the garden shed. However, when I released its head—fully expecting it to turn and attack me—it slid away from the tree and over my shoulders, settling like a colourful leathery shawl as if planning to stay for the winter. We stood in the gathering dusk: four young children, me, and the snake. DJ, my eldest, broke the heavy silence with a scientific observation: 'You know what it is, Mum?

Slowly and reluctantly, it did so, smoothly ascending the wall and disappearing over the now night-shadowed roof. As the last bit of tail vanished from our property, three-year-old Clay sighed and expressed what we all felt: 'Boy, that was one big snake!'","HAPPY HUNTING GROUND 

We're 'animal people' who enjoy the company of all kinds of creatures. Consider this typical chain of events, leading to total confusion, which began one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at work with the news that she had found a wonderful pine snake. 
'Can we keep him?' she cried. I said 'Yes, but only overnight.' We had set up a special tank for just such passers-through, overnight being long enough to admire and look them up in our well-used natural history book. 
I was late getting home. I hurriedly put a pot on to boil just as screams of 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' came from my sons' bedroom. I leapt to it. 
The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day present. (I've [line 23: beginning] heard that some mothers get [line 23: end] perfume.) Domino, with mouse feet waving from his jaws, ran round and round the bedroom that was crowded with furniture and children.

","As avid animal enthusiasts, we derive immense pleasure from the companionship of diverse creatures. Reflect upon this quintessential sequence of occurrences that culminated in utter pandemonium one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at my workplace, exultantly reporting her discovery of a magnificent pine snake. 'Might we retain him?' she implored. I acquiesced, stipulating solely an overnight stay. We maintain a designated enclosure for such transient guests, as a single night suffices for admiration and consultation within our extensively referenced natural history tome. My return home was belated; I hastily initiated the boiling of a pot when vociferous cries of 'Oh, Mother! Assist! Intervene!' emanated from my sons' chamber. I hastened thereto posthaste. The predicament entailed Domino, our feline, and Bianca, the albino murine presented to me as a Mother's Day offering. Domino, with the rodent's extremities protruding from his maw, circuited the chamber, replete with furnishings and progeny, endeavouring to evade the forest of gesticulating limbs to savour his quarry. I immersed myself in the tumult, only to stumble over an indeterminate obstacle or individual, prostrating myself upon the floor. Contemplating the imposition of my full mass upon Domino during his next transit, my gaze fixated upon the serpent. It had effected an egress—or, more precisely, was in the act of escaping—effusing itself from the table and disseminating across the floor. I assumed a crouched posture, akin to a rabbit confronting an advancing bullish cranium and formidable, elongated corpus. Both the ophidian and I were subjected to vaulting by a cacophonous, undulating aggregate of cat, mouse, and juveniles—the serpent striking intermittently, the canine vocalizing frantically. Concurrently, the culinary vessel effervesced over in the kitchen, compelling me to sprint and deactivate the gas, whereupon I rejoined the fray with invigorated resolve. On this occasion, I adeptly apprehended Domino by the caudal appendage and extricated the diminutive, sodden, and providentially unscathed mouse from his snarling jaws. Incidentally, that identical mouse was apprehended by the same feline on three subsequent occasions throughout its existence, ultimately succumbing to senescence. Emboldened by my triumph over the cat, I scrutinized the serpent for frailties, discerning none. Ultimately, I seated myself upon the floor in the manner of a serpent charmer, oscillating rhythmically albeit sans flute. Gradually, the reptile slackened sufficiently to repose its head upon its convoluted form, yet its ocular organs gleamed with wariness. I progressively and imperceptibly insinuated my digits beneath the coiled serpent, elevated myself to a genuflected stance, then arose and proceeded to the garden's extremity, where I proffered the snake the alternative of perpetual residence upon the garden shed by orienting it towards an adjacent arboreal feature. However, upon mustering the fortitude to liberate the serpent's head—anticipating an instantaneous pivot to constrict my visage within its potent mandibles—it glided away from the tree and ascended over my shoulders, where, resembling a polychromatic coriaceous shawl, it exhibited every indication of establishing a comfortable winter abode. We remained stationary in the accumulating twilight: four youthful offspring, myself, and the serpent. DJ, my primogeniture, ruptured the ponderous silence with an erudite exposition: 'Comprehend, Mother? You are pleasantly corpulent and thermal, whereas the edifice is not.' I directed the children to assemble at the serpent's caudal terminus and tenderly induce its departure. With palpable reluctance, it complied, seamlessly scaling the wall to vanish beyond the now nocturnally obscured roof. As the ultimate vestige of its tail ebbed from our demesne, Clay, aged three, exhaled profundly and articulated the collective sentiment: 'Boy, that was one big snake!'","We are unequivocally 'animal people,' deriving profound gratification from the fellowship of a myriad of creatures. Ponder this archetypal concatenation of events that precipitated absolute bedlam one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at my occupational venue, ecstatically proclaiming her unearthing of a resplendent pine snake. 'Might we perpetually harbor him?' she entreated. I concurred, albeit with the caveat of a solitary nocturnal sojourn. We have instituted a specialized vivarium for such ephemeral wayfarers, as an overnight interval affords ample opportunity for admiration and perusal within our assiduously utilized natural history compendium. My homecoming was tardy; I expeditiously commenced the ebullition of a pot when stentorian exclamations of 'Oh, Mother! Succor! Intercede!' issued forth from my sons' apartment. I propelled myself thither with alacrity. The imbroglio involved Domino, our domestic feline, and Bianca, the leucistic murine bestowed upon me as a Mother's Day benefaction. Domino, with the rodent's pedal extremities oscillating from his maxillae, circumambulated the chamber, congested with accoutrements and progeny, endeavoring to elude the phalanx of undulating appendages to relish his capture. I immersed myself in the maelstrom, only to precipitately trip over an indeterminate entity or personage, finding myself supine upon the floor. As I deliberated the application of my entire corporeal mass upon Domino during his subsequent perambulation, my ocular faculties became transfixed upon the serpent. It had achieved egress—or, more accurately, was in the process of effecting escape—effusing itself from the table and disseminating across the floor. I assumed a cowering posture, reminiscent of a leporine creature confronting an advancing taurine cephalic structure and formidable, elongated torso. Both the ophidian and I were subjected to transilience by a vociferous, undulating conglomeration of feline, murine, and juveniles—the serpent delivering intermittent strikes, the canine emitting frenzied vocalizations. Simultaneously, the culinary vessel underwent effervescent overflow in the kitchen, impelling me to sprint and terminate the gas supply, whereupon I reintegrated into the conflict with rejuvenated vigor. On this occasion, I dexterously apprehended Domino by the caudal extremity and disengaged the minuscule, humidified, and miraculously uninjured mouse from his growling oral cavity. Incidentally, that selfsame mouse was apprehended by the identical feline on three additional instances throughout its lifespan, ultimately expiring due to geriatric decline. Fortified by my success with the cat, I meticulously evaluated the serpent for vulnerabilities, discerning an utter dearth thereof. Ultimately, I assumed a seated position upon the floor in the guise of a serpent charmer, engaging in rhythmic oscillation albeit bereft of a wind instrument. Gradually, the reptile attenuated its tension sufficiently to repose its head upon its convoluted form, yet its orbicular organs scintillated with mistrust. I progressively and imperceptibly insinuated my manual appendages beneath the coiled serpent, elevated myself to a genuflected posture, then arose and advanced to the garden's nether extremity, where I proffered the snake the election of perpetual residence upon the garden shed by orienting it towards a conveniently proximate arboreal feature. However, upon mustering the requisite intrepidity to emancipate the serpent's head—anticipating an instantaneous gyration to constrict my countenance within its potent maxillae—it undulated away from the tree and ascended over my shoulders, where, resembling a polychromatic coriaceous shawl, it manifested every indication of establishing a commodious winter domicile. We remained immobile in the accumulating crepuscule: four juvenile descendants, myself, and the serpent. DJ, my primogeniture, ruptured the gravid silence with a perspicacious exegesis: 'Apprehend, Mother? You are pleasantly adipose and thermal, whereas the edifice is not.' I orchestrated the children's assembly at the serpent's caudal terminus and tenderly impelled its departure. With manifest reluctance, it acquiesced, seamlessly ascending the wall to evanesce beyond the now nocturnally obfuscated roof. As the ultimate iota of its tail receded from our property, Clay, aged three, exhaled profundly and articulated the collective sentiment: 'Boy, that was one big snake!'"
161,"Behind the dolphin's smile

People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas, films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. 

Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. They are among the most intelligent animals we know, they are sensitive to human emotions, and they allow us to dream of wonderful freedom out in the wild seas. 
This love affair has been encouraged by TV. First there was Flipper, and now there's Darwin, the star of Seaquest. However, these happy portrayals hide the reality of life for dolphins in the polluted and overfished seas of the 
late twentieth century.
The population of North Sea harbour porpoises (one kind of dolphin) is estimated to have been reduced by up to 89,000. You may expect such popular animals to be protected by law and taken care of in special marine reserves. This is not the case, however, and the lack of plans to look after them may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our times. 
Forty different kinds of dolphins are recognised worldwide. In the waters of northern Europe, the greatest number of dolphins are the striped, the common, the bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two generally live far out in the open sea. They are normally seen only in small groups, flashing quickly past ships, and we know very little about them. 
The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises, on the other hand, were once a common sight near to European coasts. Bottlenoses are particularly social and used to be found on the Channel coast and in river mouths in Britain, including the Thames. Resident populations can nowadays be found only in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the skin injuries found on the few that still remain indicate that they are suffering from stress. 
The complicated habits of the dolphins make it difficult to decide on the exact reasons for this reduction in numbers. The overfishing which is dramatically reducing the world's fish stocks and which is threatening to destroy local fishing industries, also threatens porpoises and dolphins. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. 
They are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them. In many modern fishing methods, huge nets are left to float or are pulled at great speed through the sea. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have been washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks, ropes and cuts on their bodies show that the main cause of death was the fact that they had been caught by such nets. 
Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies. The females then produce milk that is rich in pesticides, thus passing the poison in a concentrated fashion on to their young. There is already one recorded case of a young dolphin being poisoned and killed by its mother's milk. 
But perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is the one posed by human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet 
understand. ",B2,"People like dolphins. We see them in the sea, on TV, and in movies. But dolphins are in danger. A group says dolphins need help. Dolphins are smart and friendly. They make us think of the free sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest show happy dolphins. But real dolphins live in dirty seas with less fish. Many dolphins have died. For example, in the North Sea, one type of dolphin lost many animals. You might think laws protect dolphins, but they do not. This could be a big problem for wildlife. There are many kinds of dolphins. In Europe, some dolphins live far in the sea and are hard to see. Others, like bottlenose dolphins, used to be near the coast. Now, they are only in a few places in Scotland and Wales. The dolphins there have hurt skin, which shows they are stressed. It is hard to know why dolphins are fewer. Fishing takes many fish, so dolphins have less to eat. Dolphins can get stuck in fishing nets and die. We see dead dolphins on beaches with net marks. Also, bad things in the sea, like poison from pesticides, can get into dolphins' bodies. This poison can go into mother's milk and kill baby dolphins. Noise from ships and oil wells is loud in the sea. This noise might bother dolphins, but we do not know how.","People love dolphins and enjoy watching them in coastal areas, films, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society reports that dolphins are in serious trouble. Dolphins are very intelligent and sensitive to human feelings, inspiring dreams of ocean freedom. TV programs like Flipper and Seaquest depict dolphins happily, but this hides the reality of polluted and overfished seas. For instance, the North Sea harbour porpoise population may have decreased by up to 89,000. Although you might expect dolphins to be protected by law or in marine reserves, this is not happening, and it could lead to a major wildlife disaster. There are about 40 dolphin species worldwide. In northern Europe, common types include striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and harbour porpoises. Striped and common dolphins usually live far out at sea and are rarely seen, while bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once common near coasts. Now, bottlenose dolphins are only found in places like Scotland's Moray Firth and Wales' Cardigan Bay, and they show skin injuries from stress. The reasons for their decline are complex. Overfishing reduces fish stocks, threatening dolphins' food supply. Dolphins can get caught in fishing nets, which are hard for them to see, leading to many deaths, as seen on beaches in France and Cornwall. Pollutants like pesticides accumulate in dolphins' bodies and can be passed to calves through milk, sometimes causing death. Additionally, noise pollution from ships and oil rigs travels well in water and may disturb dolphins in unknown ways.","People have a strong affection for dolphins, often seeking them out in seaside locations, films, and television programmes. Yet, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins face a desperate situation. They are highly intelligent creatures that respond to human emotions and symbolise freedom in the wild seas. This positive image is reinforced by media such as Flipper and Seaquest, but it obscures the harsh realities of life in polluted and overexploited oceans. For example, the North Sea harbour porpoise population is estimated to have declined by as many as 89,000 individuals. One might assume that such popular animals are safeguarded by legislation or managed in marine reserves, but this is not the case, and the absence of conservation plans could result in a significant wildlife catastrophe. Globally, there are forty recognised dolphin species. In northern European waters, the most numerous are striped, common, and bottlenose dolphins, along with the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two species typically inhabit the open ocean and are seldom observed, whereas bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were historically common along European coastlines. Nowadays, resident bottlenose populations are confined to areas like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, with skin injuries on remaining individuals indicating stress. The decline in numbers has complex causes. Overfishing, which severely depletes fish stocks and endangers local fisheries, also threatens dolphins by reducing their food availability. Dolphins are at risk of entanglement in fishing nets, which are believed to be undetectable to them; this has led to numerous strandings of dead dolphins with net-related injuries on French and Cornish shores. Furthermore, contaminants such as pesticides, which are fat-soluble, accumulate in dolphins' tissues and can be transferred to offspring via milk, with documented cases of fatal poisoning. Human disturbance, particularly noise pollution from vessels and oil installations, is another concern, as sound travels efficiently underwater and may disrupt dolphin behaviour in ways not fully understood.","Behind the dolphin's smile

understand. ","Dolphins occupy a cherished position in human affections, with people flocking to observe them in coastal marinas, cinematic productions, and television series. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society highlights their precarious plight, underscoring a severe decline in populations. Renowned for their exceptional intelligence and sensitivity to human emotions, dolphins evoke ideals of untamed oceanic liberty. This admiration is cultivated by media portrayals, from Flipper to Seaquest's Darwin, yet these idyllic depictions mask the grim realities of existence in the polluted and overfished marine environments of the late twentieth century. Illustratively, the North Sea harbour porpoise population is estimated to have diminished by up to 89,000 individuals. While one might anticipate robust legal protections or dedicated marine sanctuaries for such iconic species, such measures are lacking, potentially culminating in one of the era's most significant wildlife calamities. Approximately forty dolphin species are identified globally, with northern European waters hosting prominent varieties such as the striped, common, and bottlenose dolphins, alongside the harbour porpoise. The former two generally inhabit pelagic zones, appearing fleetingly in small pods and remaining poorly understood, whereas bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were historically prevalent along European littorals. Presently, resident bottlenose populations are restricted to locales like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, with dermal lesions on survivors suggesting physiological stress. The multifactorial etiology of their decline complicates mitigation efforts. Overfishing, which precipitously reduces global piscine stocks and imperils artisanal fisheries, concurrently endangers cetaceans by depleting their prey base. Dolphins are susceptible to bycatch in fishing gear, purportedly imperceptible to them; high-velocity trawls and static nets have resulted in substantial mortality, evidenced by necropsies of stranded carcasses in France and Cornwall displaying characteristic injuries. Additionally, marine pollutants, including lipophilic pesticides, bioaccumulate in adipose tissues and are lactationally transmitted to progeny, with documented instances of lethal toxicosis in calves. Perhaps the most contentious threat stems from anthropogenic disturbance: as highly social beings reliant on acoustic communication, dolphins are adversely affected by underwater noise pollution from vessels and industrial activities, which propagates with quadruple the efficiency of aerial transmission, potentially inducing behavioural disruptions that remain inadequately elucidated.","Dolphins are esteemed in the human psyche, with enthusiasts congregating at seaside marinas and consuming media depictions in films and television programmes. Notwithstanding this adulation, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society delineates a dire predicament for the species, reporting a precipitous decline. These cetaceans are celebrated for their cognitive sophistication and empathic responsiveness to human sentiments, embodying aspirations of unbridled freedom in the marine wilderness. This veneration is perpetuated by televised narratives such as Flipper and Seaquest, yet these sanguine representations obfuscate the harsh verities of survival in the contaminated and overexploited oceanic realms of the contemporary era. For instance, the North Sea harbour porpoise populace is conjectured to have suffered a reduction approximating 89,000 individuals. One might presuppose that such charismatic fauna would be assiduously protected under statutory frameworks or harboured in specialised marine reserves; however, this presumption is unfounded, and the dearth of concerted conservation strategies portends one of the most egregious wildlife catastrophes of our epoch. Globally, taxonomists recognise forty distinct dolphin species, with northern European waters inhabited by predominant forms including the striped, common, and bottlenose dolphins, as well as the diminutive harbour porpoise. The initial two species are predominantly pelagic, manifesting ephemerally in modest cohorts and remaining enigmatic to science, whereas the gregarious bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were formerly ubiquitous along European coastlines. Contemporary populations of bottlenose dolphins are now circumscribed to enclaves such as the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, with integumentary injuries observed on the residual individuals indicative of chronic stress. The decline is attributable to a confluence of intricate factors: overfishing, which catastrophically diminishes global ichthyic biomass and jeopardises regional fisheries, concomitantly menaces dolphins by compromising their trophic resources. These marine mammals are imperilled by incidental capture in fishing apparatus, hypothesized to be acoustically cryptic to them; the deployment of expansive, rapidly towed nets has precipitated significant mortality, as corroborated by post-mortem examinations of stranded specimens on French and Cornish shores exhibiting telltale lacerations and entanglement marks. Moreover, xenobiotics such as lipophilic pesticides undergo bioaccumulation in cetacean adipocytes and are transmittable via lactation, resulting in hyperconcentrated exposure to neonates, with attested cases of lethal intoxication. Arguably the most polemical hazard is anthropogenic disturbance: dolphins, as eusocial entities dependent on sonic perception for environmental interpretation, are susceptible to acoustic pollution from maritime traffic and hydrocarbon extraction infrastructures, which propagates with quadruple the efficacy of aerial transmission, potentially inducing cryptic behavioural alterations that remain insufficiently comprehended."
162,"Careers Advice 

You're not happy in your job at the moment, but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. 

 
The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. A summary of the findings is then given and various careers are suggested, as well as the possible retraining needed. 
I decided to try out Career Analysts, one of the largest organisations giving career advice. Taking the careers test was like being back in my science exams. I was with a group of about ten people and we were answering questions against the clock. I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometrics would give an accurate picture of me. They involved things like picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching up similar shapes in a set. 
I then had a long chat with an adviser and from this, plus the results of the test, he produced a report giving his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the adviser's conclusions, though I was a little dismayed to find out that I had done quite badly in the scientific, technical and practical tests. I am sure that a lot of sick people are glad that I never became a nurse. It was reassuring, though, to be told that I had made the correct decisions as far as journalism was concerned. 
Rethinking your career needn't involve a massive change of direction. Last March, after working as a marketing manager with a large insurance company for five years, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. 'Losing my job was the perfect opportunity for me to take a step back and look at my career to date. I wanted to re-examine the skills and interests I have,' says Donna. Some of the results were surprising. 'I hadn't realised that I had such a gift for design. But in the end I had to balance the cost of retraining in design against my financial commitments,' she says. Other suggestions were put forward, such as taking a year off and working in the Far East. 
'I decided to use the skills I already had and move into something more suited to me than insurance. I am now working as a Public Relations officer. I am sure I would have got to this point without Career Analysts but they helped me realise, objectively and independently, what I definitely wanted to do. I have sent half a dozen friends there, who are all happy with the service.' 
There are those who feel that they definitely would not have got to that point without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make some life-changing decisions. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I decided my job was dull and I needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I went to Career Counselling Services with a completely open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was taped, which I found very useful, as you forget many of the things you say. After the fourth meeting, having listened carefully to what the results of the tests were telling me, I made the decision that I wanted to do geology and I plan to start a degree course in it later this year. I think that the advice given by Career Counselling Services was well worth the fee. I'm a lot happier now and far more positive.' 
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I had reached a stage in my career where I didn't know where to go. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something I had never thought of. Although I was given a host of new ideas, I rejected them as they either required a substantial drop in salary or considerable retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't know/ she says. 'You have to provide the adviser with an enormous amount of personal information and I just felt that if I had told a friend the same thing, they would have given me similar advice.'

","For individuals discontented with their current employment yet uncertain about effecting a change, careers advisers offer a viable solution. The process entails composing a succinct personal history and undergoing a series of psychometric assessments. Subsequently, a summary of the findings is provided, along with recommendations for alternative careers and any requisite retraining. The author recounts her experience with Career Analysts, where she participated in timed tests in a group setting, reminiscent of scientific examinations, involving tasks such as detecting inaccuracies in lists and correlating analogous shapes. She expressed skepticism regarding the tests' capacity to yield an accurate portrayal of her aptitudes. Following an extensive consultation, the adviser generated a report with observations and recommendations, with which she largely concurred, albeit with chagrin over her subpar performance in scientific, technical, and practical domains, while finding solace in the affirmation of her journalistic inclinations. Donna Laney, upon losing her position as a marketing manager, engaged Career Analysts and uncovered an unforeseen proclivity for design; however, she weighed the financial implications of retraining against her obligations and ultimately transitioned to public relations, leveraging her extant skills and valuing the objective guidance. Juliet Greene, seeking respite from a monotonous banking career, consulted Career Counselling Services; psychometric evaluations indicated a scientific bent, and after deliberative sessions, including a recorded one for reflection, she resolved to embark on a geology degree, deeming the investment in advice eminently justified by her enhanced contentment. Conversely, Amanda Margetts derived little benefit from careers advice, as the proffered ideas necessitated substantial salary reductions or extensive retraining, and she perceived that divulging copious personal information yielded insights no more profound than those from confidants.","When professional dissatisfaction prevails yet the trajectory for change remains nebulous, an increasing number of individuals are turning to careers advisers for elucidation. The methodology involves drafting a concise autobiographical sketch and submitting to a battery of psychometric evaluations, culminating in a synthesized report that delineates potential career paths and the imperative for any retraining. The author's foray into Career Analysts, a preeminent advisory entity, entailed participating in rigorously timed assessments amidst a cohort, evoking the rigors of scientific examinations through exercises such as discerning anomalies in nomenclatural and numerical sequences and identifying congruent geometric forms. She remained circumspect about the efficacy of these instruments in encapsulating her essence. A protracted dialogue with an adviser ensued, yielding a comprehensive report replete with astute observations and prescriptive recommendations; she accorded with the majority of the conclusions, though was disconcerted by her deficient performance in scientific, technical, and practical spheres, while deriving reassurance from the validation of her journalistic proclivities. Donna Laney, erstwhile marketing manager who faced redundancy, availed herself of Career Analysts' services and discovered an latent aptitude for design; nevertheless, she prudently equilibrated the fiscal exigencies of retraining against her monetary commitments, opting instead to transmute her extant competencies into a public relations role, crediting the impartial, objective insights for her felicitous transition. Juliet Greene, wearied by the banality of her banking vocation, sought counsel from Career Counselling Services; the psychometric revelations underscored a scientific predisposition, and after immersive sessions—one of which was recorded to mitigate mnemonic fallibility—she elected to pursue a degree in geology, adjudging the advisory fee a paltry sum for the profound augmentation of her existential satisfaction. In stark contradistinction, Amanda Margetts found the advisory process ineffectual, as the plethora of proposed alternatives mandated either a precipitous diminution in remuneration or considerable pedagogical endeavors, and she contended that the voluminous personal disclosures yielded no epiphanies beyond what amicable counsel might proffer."
163,"ICE SKATING 

Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes, skating was seen as an essential skill. 
In the early twentieth century, skating was stylish and reserved, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11- year-old Sonja Henie introduced a more athletic attitude which inspired a new wave of popularity. Nowadays art and athletics are combined and modern skating is both graceful and physically demanding. 
For the beginner, balance and control are all important and speed can only increase with proficiency. The position of your body plays a great part in balance. Legs slightly bowed and the knees bent keep the body weight centred; in effect the body leans slightly forward in this position. For skating, probably more than any other sport or recreation, relaxation is vital.
For the starting position, the heels should almost be touching and the feet should be turned outwards. While pushing forward with the back foot, you make a very small movement with the other foot. Fairly easy, isn't it? If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. 
Knowing how to fall must be learnt among the skater's first skills. Even the best of the professionals fall. In order to fall without injury, you should be as relaxed as possible. In this way the shock of hitting the ice is lessened. To get up, use your hands to get into a kneeling position, then stand. 
Once you have learnt to move on the ice with confidence, there are various styles to be practised - figure skating, free style, distance, speed, skating in pairs, and so on - but the basis of them all, and by far the best approach, is first to learn figure skating and then elementary freestyle. With proper guidance available at most of the ice rinks throughout the country, the basic figures can soon be learnt and the turns, jumps and spins of elementary free style will soon follow. 
If you look at any good or professional skater, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this an exercise programme should be regularly practised. It can be dangerous to skate with a stiff body and warm-up exercises should at least include those for the legs, back and shoulders, with special emphasis on the ankles and the knees. After a long or intense session, the same exercises should be used afterwards to avoid stiffness.

Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness. ","Ice skating boasts a millennia-old heritage, with archaeological evidence of bone skates preceding the advent of iron in Scandinavia circa 200 AD, where it was deemed an indispensable proficiency among the aristocracy. The early twentieth century witnessed a reserved elegance in skating, yet the 1924 Winter Olympics were transformative, as an 11-year-old prodigy introduced a dynamic, athletic ethos that catalyzed a resurgence in its appeal. Contemporary skating synthesizes aesthetic grace with rigorous physical exertion. Novices must prioritize equilibrium and command, facilitated by a posture with slightly bowed legs, flexed knees, and a forward inclination to centralize mass. Initiate movement from a stance with heels proximate and feet everted, executing minor propulsions. Acquiring the technique to tumble harmlessly is imperative, as professionals are not immune to falls; maintaining relaxation mitigates impact. Upon attaining assurance, diverse disciplines such as figure skating, freestyle, and speed skating can be pursued, with figure skating serving as the quintessential foundation. Optimal performance necessitates a regimen of preparatory and recuperative exercises targeting the legs, back, and shoulders, with emphasis on ankles and knees, to avert rigidity. Skating augments balance, coordination, and cardiopulmonary function, constituting a comprehensive fitness regimen when integrated with activities like swimming or jogging.","Ice skating's provenance spans millennia, with archaeological discoveries of osseous skates that persisted until iron's introduction into Scandinavia around 200 AD, wherein it was regarded as an essential competency among the patrician classes. The early twentieth century epitomized a staid and decorous form of skating; however, the 1924 Winter Olympics heralded a paradigm shift, as an 11-year-old luminary infused an athletic vigor that precipitated a renaissance in its popularity. In the modern era, skating is an amalgamation of artistic expression and physically exigent discipline. For neophytes, paramount importance lies in mastering balance and control, which are contingent upon a posture characterized by subtly arced legs, genuflected knees, and a slight anterior inclination to optimize center of gravity. Commence from a position with heels in near apposition and feet abducted, effectuating minuscule advancements via posterior propulsion. Proficiency in falling without incurring injury is an indispensable rudimentary skill, as even consummate professionals are susceptible; maximal relaxation attenuates the concussive force upon impact. Subsequent to achieving poise on the ice, one may engage in multifarious modalities—figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating—with figure skating constituting the foundational and most efficacious approach. To emulate the fluidity of adept skaters, a consistent exercise regimen is obligatory, incorporating pre-skating warm-ups and post-session stretches focused on the legs, back, and shoulders, with particular attention to the ankles and knees to forestall rigidity. Skating confers enhancements in equilibrium, motor coordination, and cardiopulmonary efficiency, and when synergized with pursuits such as swimming or jogging, it furnishes a holistic program for robust health and fitness."

Teenager with a taste for endurance 

WANTED: Sports-mad training partner for triathlete, preferably female. Chance to work with potential Olympic champion. Should be extremely keen on distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (addiction to winter training in cold rivers useful) and distance cycling (love of 1OOkm an advantage). Ability to do all three without a rest essential. 

The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds fascinated (and horrified) by athletes swimming 1500m, cycling 40km, then running 1Okm without stopping. Great for those watching, maybe, but what makes the triathletes want to punish their bodies so much? And what makes an attractive 17-year-old, with excellent academic results, give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers? 
Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes automatically use when asked similar questions. 'You swim for 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the 40km cycle ride is over, you have to run 1Okm, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,' she says. 
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. 'I won the junior section - but then I was the only junior taking part. It seemed so easy that I was waving at my team-mates as I went round.' Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. 'I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realised then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far. I cried all the way through the running.' 
But she did not give up and is determined that she never will. 'Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be [line 35: beginning] tempted to do it again.' Such doggedness draws [line 35: end] admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. 'I've just been testing her fitness,' he says, 'and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She had given it everything, but whereas most people step off when they realise they can't go any further, she just kept on.' 
Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with PS1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. 
But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.' What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? 'No, what sort of times they are achieving.' 
Where will all this single-mindedness end? Melanie has tried other events. She has had a go at the triathlon 'sprint', for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. 'The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,' she says. Funny, that. ",B2,"A girl named Melanie likes to do a hard sport.

Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. 'I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it.' She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike ('It's a special deal, with PS1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. 
But there is another price to pay. Her punishing training sessions have made her a bit of a recluse. 'I don't have a social life,' she says. 'I'm not a party animal anyway. After two hours' hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team.' What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? 'No, what sort of times they are achieving.' 
Where will all this single-mindedness end? Melanie has tried other events. She has had a go at the triathlon 'sprint', for example, where you only have to swim 750m, cycle 20km and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. 'The big trouble is, I have no one of my age to train with,' she says. Funny, that. ","What motivates a schoolgirl to endure the grueling sequence of swimming 1500 meters, cycling 40 kilometers, and running 10 kilometers consecutively? For Melanie Sears, the answer is sheer enjoyment. This endurance-focused teenager embarked on her triathlon journey at 14, securing a junior victory by default as the sole participant. However, during the National Championships, a navigational error led her to cycle an additional 20 kilometers, reducing her to tears mid-run, yet her resolve remained unshaken. Her tenacity earns admiration from coaching director Steve Trew, who notes her exceptional effort on a treadmill that ultimately ejected her. As the leading junior in the European Triathlon Championships, Melanie recognizes her cycling as a weakness and is persuading her parents to invest in a high-performance bicycle to compete in national races. Her intense training regimen has rendered her somewhat reclusive, with social interactions limited to discussing athletic achievements with teammates. Aspiring to surpass even triathlon challenges, she laments the absence of a peer training companion.","What compels a schoolgirl to subject herself to the arduous trifecta of a 1500-meter swim, a 40-kilometer cycle, and a 10-kilometer run without intermission? Melanie Sears attributes it to an intrinsic sense of pleasure. This adolescent, with a proclivity for endurance, commenced her triathlon endeavors at 14, clinching a junior title merely by virtue of being the lone entrant. In the National Championships, despite posting commendable swim and run times, she faltered due to a navigational blunder, cycling an superfluous 20 kilometers and weeping throughout the subsequent run, yet her fortitude never wavered. Her indefatigable spirit elicits acclaim from Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director, who recounts an incident where her exertion on a treadmill was so intense it propelled her into a wall. Having emerged as the premier junior in the European Triathlon Championships, Melanie is acutely aware of her cycling deficiencies and is endeavoring to convince her long-suffering parents to procure a premium bicycle, facilitating her participation in national competitions. Her rigorous training has engendered a reclusive tendency, with social exchanges confined to deliberations on performance metrics with fellow athletes. Despite her aspirations to undertake even more formidable events, she bemoans the dearth of a contemporaneous training ally."

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival, and spends a nervous night in the forest. 

Adnan Ali smiled broadly as I presented him with his torn kite. 'You have to keep it,' he said, 'it's traditional - if the line breaks, finders are keepers ... and anyway, I've plenty more.' He indicated a pile of intricately decorated kites at his feet. All were precisely 120cm wide and long, and made of tissue paper and split bamboo. 
We sat down next to them in the shade of the whispering coniferous trees that are behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in the state of Kelantan, and looked out over Malaysia's biggest and most serious kite festival.
In the centre of the beach stood 10 platforms, where helpers held up the kites, and a row of tense competitors holding the lines of their kites waited for the countdown. On the blast of the whistle, the crowd roared and the kites rose into the air like rockets. 
More than 500 men and boys had registered for the competition, which runs for five days every year. Each had entered four different designs which were to be judged on decoration, stability in the air and flying efficiency. 
'Flying kites isn't so difficult,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' The invitation was one of five I'd received that day, and I decided to accept. 
Back in his house I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As dusk fell, he told me to come again the next day to start rebuilding his kite but my plans didn't allow it. 
Instead I explored the southern half of the state, pointing my car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur, into granite mountains dripping with luxuriant rainforest. I took a wrong turning and the smooth road ended suddenly at a river. 
A needle-shaped boat was waiting to ferry pedestrians across. Near it, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' 
Before setting off, it would have been useful to know that nearly all of this distance was uphill, steep and slippery. When I got to the track, however, I found a chap waiting with a flask of tea. 
This was Baba, who looked after a tented kitchen and a dozen or so bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, determined not to think twice about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 
Night was totally black, full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby and thousands of living things moved and squeaked. In the morning there was a tremendous view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon it rained. 
First wind, then lightning lashed the treetops. Seconds later I was wet through. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the scores of giant butterflies avoided the enormous drops. 
Other thoughts included the possibility of my car being swept away (it sometimes happens) and the likelihood of drowning if I opened my mouth. Fortunately the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 
No one is a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, everyone fired questions at me: 'Where are you from?' 'How old are you?' 
But in the asking there was nothing but friendliness. Kelantan might be best known for its kites but I remember it more for its human kindness. ",B2,"Paul Forster goes to a kite festival in Malaysia.

","Paul Forster journeys to Malaysia's Kelantan state for a kite-flying festival, where he presents Adnan Ali with a torn kite. Adnan, smiling broadly, insists Paul retain it, citing the tradition that finders keep broken kites and noting his ample supply of intricately decorated kites crafted from tissue paper and split bamboo, each precisely 120cm in dimensions. Seated in the shade of whispering coniferous trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons, they observe Malaysia's premier kite festival, featuring ten platforms where helpers assist competitors in launching kites that ascend rapidly upon a whistle blast. With over 500 entrants competing over five days, kites are evaluated on decoration, aerial stability, and flying efficiency. Adnan remarks that kite construction demands genuine skill and extends an invitation to his home, one of several Paul receives that day. Accepting, Paul visits Adnan's house, partaking of cold milky tea and fish crackers in a polished room, but declines a subsequent offer to rebuild the kite due to scheduling constraints. Instead, Paul explores southern Kelantan, driving inland towards Kuala Lumpur through granite mountains adorned with luxuriant rainforest. A navigational error leads him to a river terminus, where a needle-shaped boat awaits pedestrians; there, a sign for Jelawang Jungle prompts him to trek a steep, slippery three-kilometer uphill path. At the trail's end, he encounters Baba, who oversees a tented kitchen and bamboo huts, and opts to stay overnight. The night is impenetrably dark, resonant with the roar of a waterfall and the cacophony of nocturnal fauna. Morning reveals a breathtaking panorama of five verdant mountain ranges, but afternoon brings a tempest with wind and lightning that drenches Paul as he descends, pondering the survival of giant butterflies and potential hazards like car loss or drowning. Fortunately, his car remains, albeit mud-splattered, at the path's base. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, locals engage him with inquisitive yet amicable queries, leading Paul to reflect that while the region is famed for kites, its profound human kindness leaves a more indelible impression.","Paul Forster embarks on a Malaysian excursion, attending a kite-flying festival in Kelantan, where he hands Adnan Ali a torn kite. Adnan, beaming, exhorts Paul to keep it, invoking the customary practice whereby finders retain kites with severed lines and alluding to his abundant stock of exquisitely decorated kites, each uniformly 120cm in width and length, fashioned from tissue paper and split bamboo. They recline adjacent to these kites beneath the murmuring coniferous trees fringing the Beach of the Seven Lagoons, surveying Malaysia's most significant kite festival. At the beach's core, ten platforms host assistants supporting kites, while a row of anxious competitors clutch lines, anticipating the countdown; upon the whistle's blast, the assemblage erupts in acclamation as kites surge skyward like projectiles. Exceeding 500 males, both men and boys, have enrolled in the five-day competition, with each submitting four distinct designs assessed on decorative artistry, aerial stability, and flying proficiency. Adnan observes that while kite flying poses little challenge, their fabrication demands authentic expertise, and he proffers an invitation to his residence, which Paul accepts amid several received that day. In Adnan's abode, Paul savors chilled milky tea and fish crackers within a capacious, polished chamber. As twilight descends, Adnan bids him return the subsequent day to commence kite restoration, but Paul's itinerary precludes this. Diverting to the state's southern sector, he directs his vehicle inland on the Kuala Lumpur route, traversing granite massifs sheathed in opulent rainforest. An errant turn culminates abruptly at a riverbank, where a slender boat stands ready to transport pedestrians. Nearby, a diminutive sign captivates his attention, indicating a footpath into the forest labeled 'Jelawang Jungle 3 km.' Prior to departure, foreknowledge of the path's predominantly arduous, precipitous, and slick ascent would have been advantageous; upon arrival, however, he encounters Baba, who administers a tented kitchen and approximately a dozen bamboo huts. Resolving to lodge there, Paul steels himself against apprehensions of insects infiltrating his slender foam mattress. The nocturnal expanse is utterly lightless, saturated with a symphony of sounds: a proximate waterfall thunders, while myriad organisms rustle and vocalize. Dawn unveils a magnificent vista encompassing five serried ranges of emerald mountains. Afternoon precipitates a deluge, commencing with gusting winds succeeded by lightning lashing the arboreal canopy, swiftly saturating Paul. During his descent, he muses on the evasion tactics of scores of colossal butterflies confronting the voluminous raindrops, concurrently entertaining grim eventualities such as his automobile being inundated (a occasional occurrence) or the peril of asphyxiation were he to unseal his mouth. Providentially, the vehicle persists, albeit besmirched with mire, at the trail's terminus. In Kota Bahru, Kelantan's capital, anonymity proves ephemeral as denizens assail him with interrogatives regarding his origin and age, yet their inquiries radiate unadulterated amiability. Although Kelantan is renowned for its kites, Paul's recollection is more profoundly imprinted by the magnanimity of its inhabitants."
166,"What sort of shopper are you? 

Love it or hate it, we all go shopping. But there are different types of shopper. Do you know which kind you are? Abby Edwards asked around ... 

A. Melanie, 22, dancer

I'm an addict - I can't spend enough money! When I have the cash I'm out there and then I don't get miserable. I definitely have difficulty walking past sale signs. My boyfriend's exactly the same, so we often drag each other around the shops. We're an addicted couple! 

B. Brenda, 40, office manager

I'm a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he does the cooking and knows what he likes. I don't spend much time shopping for clothes ... I do take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter out to get clothes, but I don't enjoy that either, as we all have different tastes. I don't spend money on myself regularly, so when I do splash out I tend to feel guilty and rarely tell my husband how much I've spent - I always knock the price down a bit! The real price always sounds so shocking. 

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager

I only shop for essentials I hate shopping and only go when I really have to. When I do, I know what I want and I won't settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and there's always something I'd rather be doing. 

D. Anita, 35, TV producer

I like a good look round every now and then but I tend to know what I want, and where to find it. I don't waste time and I get in and out as quickly as I can. I do have hidden mistakes at the back of my wardrobe though so maybe I'm a careful shopper who sometimes gets particular purchases wrong! 

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary

I don't enjoy shopping in the least. I really dislike shopping for clothes as I can never find what I want, or anyone to help me look for it. The shops are too noisy, everything is disordered and I find it an absolute nightmare. Fortunately, I rarely have to shop for clothes as most of my clothes are given to me. As for food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and get it over and done with quickly! 

F. Lisa, 22, actress

I'm probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I'll go out for a look around the shops with my girlfriends - and we'll often end up spending. I don't usually go out with a certain item in mind, but if something catches my eye I'll buy it. 

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant

I'm a careful shopper - I like going, but I don't really buy very much. I usually know what I want and I seldom go crazy. I do sometimes shop to cheer myself up - but I usually end up feeling much worse because I've spent too much! 

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker 

I love shopping - but only on certain days and never on a Saturday, as it's far too busy. I'd say I'm a careful shopper ... I always set off with a fair idea of what I want, and I never snap things up immediately. I have to look in other shops, in case I can find a better bargain - I take ages! 

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager

I'm an unwilling shopper - maybe because I work in the city centre, the shops have lost their attraction for me. When I have to, I'll drag myself out - but I don't bother to try things on, it's far too much trouble.

Regardless of personal preference, shopping is a universal activity, yet distinct shopper types exist. Abby Edwards conducted interviews to explore this. A. Melanie, 22, dancer: I am a compulsive shopper, unable to curb expenditures when funds are available; sale signs are particularly irresistible. My boyfriend shares this tendency, so we frequently accompany each other on shopping excursions, forming an addicted pair. B. Brenda, 40, office manager: I am a reluctant participant in shopping; my husband predominately handles grocery purchases due to his culinary role. Shopping for my children's apparel is undertaken out of necessity, not pleasure, given our divergent tastes. Infrequent personal spending induces guilt, leading me to understate costs to my husband, as the actual amounts seem exorbitant. C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager: My shopping is confined to essentials; I detest the activity and engage only when imperative. I am decisive in my selections and refuse alternatives, finding the process fatiguing and preferring other pursuits. D. Anita, 35, TV producer: I occasionally enjoy perusing shops but generally have clear objectives and expedite the process. Nonetheless, I have erred in purchases, with mistakes concealed in my wardrobe, suggesting a generally cautious approach with occasional lapses. E. Lizzie, 41, secretary: I hold an intense aversion to clothes shopping, exacerbated by difficulties in locating desired items and a lack of assistance. The cacophony and disorder render it a dreadful experience; luckily, most attire is gifted. Grocery shopping is dispatched swiftly on a weekly basis. F. Lisa, 22, actress: I embody the happy shopper; outings with friends often culminate in purchases made on impulse rather than premeditation, with items that capture my attention. G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant: I am a prudent shopper; while I derive pleasure from browsing, acquisitions are infrequent and typically planned. Attempts to elevate my mood through shopping often result in remorse over expenditure. H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker: I relish shopping but eschew peak times like Saturdays. My approach is methodical; I commence with a general idea and meticulously compare options to secure bargains, prolonging the process. I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager: I am an unwilling shopper, perhaps due to overexposure from my city-centre employment. When compelled to shop, I forgo trying on items, accepting occasional misfits as preferable to the exertion involved.","Into which shopper archetype do you align? Irrespective of individual predilections, shopping constitutes a ubiquitous endeavor, yet it manifests in diverse behavioral patterns. Abby Edwards solicited insights from various individuals to delineate these distinctions. A. Melanie, 22, dancer: I exhibit addictive shopping tendencies, finding it impossible to moderate expenditures when financially able; promotional displays are particularly compelling. My partner harbors analogous inclinations, resulting in frequent joint shopping ventures that reinforce our compulsive dynamic. B. Brenda, 40, office manager: I approach shopping with reluctance; my spouse assumes primary responsibility for grocery procurement, aligning with his culinary expertise. Acquiring attire for my offspring is a duty I undertake without enjoyment, given our disparate aesthetic preferences. Sparing self-indulgence evokes guilt, prompting me to dissemble about costs to my husband, as the veritable sums appear disproportionately high. C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager: My engagement with shopping is strictly utilitarian; I abhor the activity and participate only under duress. I am resolute in my requirements and eschew compromises, deeming the process enervating and inferior to alternative occupations. D. Anita, 35, TV producer: I derive intermittent satisfaction from browsing retail environments but typically operate with defined intentions and efficiency. However, I have committed purchasing errors, evidenced by items sequestered in my wardrobe, indicating a generally judicious shopper prone to occasional miscalculations. E. Lizzie, 41, secretary: I experience profound antipathy towards apparel shopping, compounded by challenges in sourcing suitable items and inadequate assistance. The auditory and visual chaos renders it an ordeal; fortuitously, the majority of my wardrobe is procured through gifts. Provisions are obtained expediently during weekly supermarket visits. F. Lisa, 22, actress: I epitomize the contented shopper; social excursions with companions frequently lead to serendipitous acquisitions, driven by visual appeal rather than predetermined objectives. G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant: I am a circumspect shopper; while I enjoy the ambience of shopping, my purchases are restrained and typically premeditated. Endeavors to ameliorate my disposition through retail therapy often culminate in regret over fiscal imprudence. H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker: I delight in shopping but deliberately avoid congested periods such as Saturdays. My methodology is deliberate; I initiate with a vague conception and engage in extensive comparative analysis to optimize value, thereby protracting the duration. I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager: I am an involuntary shopper, potentially owing to desensitization from my proximate urban workplace. When necessity dictates, I abstain from fitting garments, tolerating occasional inaccuracies in sizing as a lesser evil compared to the rigors of the shopping process."
167,"Father and son start Gold Rush 

Terence and Chris Madden have travelled from Canada's frozen north to the heat of Africa in their search for nature's most desired metals. The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. 
After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced that they are just metres away from a five million dollar vein of gold. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to get a few more metres to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. 
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. Their search began after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town of the same name. While reading 19th century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the most promising area of land to study. 
Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. They then set about digging out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to form a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. 
Now they are running short of money. Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' 
As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started turning the heads of the inhabitants as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. 'It would encourage more people to come here if they are right,' said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, 'but if these two find gold I hope millions of people are not going to come and hack away at the hillside.' 
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s, when thousands were employed in hundreds of mines dotted around the countryside. One of the last remaining mines at Clogau-St David's, which produced wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. 
Now, however, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. 'Searching for gold is very emotional,' said Hall, 70. 'It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time.' ",B2,A father and son look for gold. They are from Canada. Now they are in Wales. They think there is a lot of gold in a mountain. They have dug for ten years. They need more money to dig deeper. People in the town hope they find gold. Gold is special. It can bring more people to the town.,"A father and son from Canada are searching for gold in Wales. They believe their mine has much gold. After ten years of digging, they are close to a big gold vein. They have spent their savings and need £50,000 to continue. The town's people are interested because gold could attract tourists. Gold mining in Wales was big in the past but has declined. Other people are also looking for gold now.","Terence and Chris Madden, a father and son from Canada, are hunting for gold in Wales. They think their mine could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After a decade of digging, they are just metres away from a valuable gold vein. They have used their savings and now require £50,000 from a backer to reach the gold. Local residents are cautiously optimistic, as a gold find might boost tourism. The Welsh gold industry has declined since the 1880s, but individual prospectors like George Hall are returning to search for gold.","Father and son start Gold Rush

Having exhausted their savings, they must secure £50,000 in funding to excavate further. The local community, reliant on tourism, views the potential discovery with cautious hope, wary of a gold rush. Meanwhile, the Welsh gold industry, which peaked in the late 19th century, has seen a resurgence with individual prospectors like George Hall renewing the search for hidden treasure.","Terence and Chris Madden, a paternal-filial team comprising an explorer and a mineral specialist, have journeyed from the frigid climes of Canada to the temperate Welsh highlands in pursuit of nature's most coveted metals. They are confident that their mine, situated on a mountainside in Wales, harbors up to 10,000 ounces of gold. Following a decade of arduous excavation, they assert that they are within mere metres of a gold vein valued at five million dollars, having devoted their existence to this endeavor after uncovering references to lucrative gold deposits in the Dolgellau gold belt within 19th-century mining archives. Having depleted their personal finances, they now face the imperative of persuading an investor to contribute £50,000 to facilitate the final descent to the gold's locus. As news of their dig permeated the valleys, it ignited the allure of gold among locals and prospectors alike, with residents expressing tempered optimism about potential tourism benefits, though concerns about environmental degradation persist. The Welsh gold industry, which experienced a zenith in the late 1880s with extensive employment, has undergone a precipitous decline, exemplified by the recent closure of the Clogau-St David's mine, yet a renaissance is underway as individual gold-diggers, such as George Hall, re-engage in the emotionally charged and adventurous quest for concealed treasure."

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business.
Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico, USA, and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. They are playing the ancient game of pichenotte, one which, they insist, is unlike any other.
Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer originally from Quebec, Canada, brought the game into the USA and introduced it to his family. It wasn't long before, on just about every weekend and holiday, the family were playing the game and, as Dave says, 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he'd made out of old wooden food crates, was not forgotten and they continued to play regularly. If visitors dropped by they were often fascinated, for the game was completely unknown in southern USA.
One day, three years ago, Dave set up the ancient pichenotte board and, realising how cracked and battered it had become, decided to make a new one. This turned out to be a beauty. A relative noticed and wanted one. Then a friend wanted another. Curious as to how great the interest might be, one night the brothers took one of Dave's new game boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People there started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and pretty soon you couldn't them up from the table!'
When people started asking about the origins of the game, Dave decided to do some research. The roots, he discovered, were probably in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. That was adapted into a game called 'squails' which was played in pubs in Britain and, a century ago, British people emigrating to Canada brought the game with them. Pichenotte is the name of the French-Canadian version of the game that developed in Quebec.
Pichenotte, which can be played by two to four people, is clearly a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. Three concentric rings around the hole are worth 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Eight tiny posts present obstacles. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
When they saw how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made a couple more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money changed hands and the game's popularity grew. So much so that championships began to take place and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. With word spreading more widely, the boards began to sell as fast as the brothers could make them. Eventually, they decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time.
They set up a workshop in the garage of their house and started turning out boards. More than 450 have been produced to date. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each weighs 12kg and is lcm thick. As Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of wear.' They are available, at $595 each, from the brothers' website.
As yet, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to produce pichenotte celebrities. Nonetheless, the day is not far off when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury Mercedes rather than a saw and piles of wood. Until then, they're happy to spend their off-duty hours playing the game they hope will make their fortune.",B2,"Two brothers, Dave and Norm, are from the USA. They play a game from their childhood.

When Dave crafted a replacement for the aged board, interest surged; a trial in a local sports bar revealed its appeal, leading to sales at markets and fairs. Pichenotte, derived from games like carroms and squails, involves skillfully flicking pucks on a board to accrue points via holes and concentric rings.

Upon moving to New Mexico, they perpetuated this tradition. When Dave, noting the deterioration of the original board, fashioned a superior replacement, it garnered immediate attention; an impromptu demonstration in a sports bar captivated spectators, swiftly converting skepticism into fervent participation.

169,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS 

How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects, the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity. Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. 
The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a
sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians.
Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which tends to concentrate on the essential subjects - English, maths, basic sciences and languages - although provision can be made for students who wish to study a wider range of subjects. All five British specialist schools are independent, classes are small by normal school standards, with a high teacher/pupil ratio. Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders, leaving home to live, eat and sleep full-time at school. This means they spend their formative years in the company of others with similar aims and interests. 
What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is the cost; the fees are high (PS12,000-PS17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance, to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, specially at a very early age. Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment. They stress, however, that their main aim is to turn out 'rounded and well-balanced individuals'. 
There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress. Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years, while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed.
In addition, while most former pupils at music school feel that they benefited enormously from the range of high-quality music teaching available, many express reservations about the wisdom of restricting the academic programme, which definitely takes second place to musical activities. Many musically gifted young people are also highly intelligent, well able to deal with academic pressure, and feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. For these reasons, it may be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education. 
Those who are equally gifted academically may do very well within a less specialised environment; for instance, at a school with a first class music department, or else by combining a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience. But this option is clearly not practicable for families living out of reach of London or other major centres. ",B2,"Some children are very good at music. It can be hard for parents to know how to help them. Sometimes, parents do not see that their child needs help. This can make the child unhappy. Most schools help children who are good at school subjects. But schools may not help children who are good at music. Special music schools can help these children. There are five special music schools in Britain. They are for children aged 7 to 18. The schools help children learn music with teachers who are musicians. Children at these schools spend a lot of time on music. They have lessons, play in groups, and practice. They also learn some school subjects like English and math. The classes are small. Most children live at the school. This means they are with other children who like music. But these schools cost a lot of money. The schools can give money to help some parents. Also, some parents do not want their young children to live at school. The schools watch the children to help them. Some children feel stressed. Their music skill may go away when they are older. Children at these schools learn a lot of music, but they do not learn many school subjects. This can be a problem for smart children. It might be better to wait until the child is older to go to a special music school. Some children can do well in a normal school with good music classes. They can also take music lessons on Saturdays. But this is not easy for families who live far from big cities.","When a child has great musical ability, parents may not know how to support them. Sometimes, parents do not notice the child's needs, which can lead to frustration and bad behavior. Most schools are good with children who excel in academic subjects, but they may not understand musically gifted children. Specialist music schools can provide the right environment for these children. In Britain, there are five such schools, which are fairly new. They offer a supportive place for gifted children aged 7 to 18 to develop their skills with professional musicians. At these schools, children spend much of their day on musical activities like individual lessons, orchestras, and practice. They also study basic academic subjects such as English, math, and sciences. The schools are independent, with small classes and high teacher attention. Most children are boarders, living full-time at school with others who share their interests. However, there are disadvantages. The fees are high, but scholarships can help. Some parents do not want to send young children to boarding school. School leaders worry about admitting very young children into a strict environment, but they aim to create well-rounded individuals. Separating gifted children early can cause stress, and musical talent might fade in teenage years. The schools monitor progress and offer support. Former students often value the music teaching but regret the limited academic program, which can frustrate intelligent children. It may be better to wait until the child can decide. Alternatively, gifted children might thrive in a normal school with a strong music department or with weekend music training, though this is not feasible for those living far from cities.","Dealing with a child who demonstrates exceptional musical talent can be challenging for parents, who may struggle to identify and nurture their gift, potentially leading to frustration and behavioral issues. While most schools are equipped to support academically gifted students, they often lack the specialized understanding required for musically talented children, especially in institutions where music is not a priority. Specialist music schools offer an alternative, providing an environment where gifted children aged 7 to 18 can fully develop their abilities under professional guidance. In Britain, there are five such schools, which are relatively recent establishments. Students devote a significant portion of their day to musical pursuits, including individual instrument lessons, ensemble participation, and practice sessions, while also following a condensed academic curriculum focused on core subjects. These independent schools feature small classes and high teacher-student ratios, with most pupils boarding to immerse themselves in a community of like-minded peers. Drawbacks include high costs, though financial aid is available, and reservations from some parents about boarding, particularly for young children. School directors acknowledge concerns about the intensity for early ages but emphasize their goal of fostering well-balanced individuals. Early separation can induce stress, and talent may diminish during adolescence, but schools closely monitor students and provide assistance. Alumni often appreciate the high-quality music education but criticize the limited academic offerings, which may not meet the needs of intellectually gifted students. Therefore, delaying enrollment until the child is older could be advisable. Other options include attending schools with excellent music departments or combining regular education with training at music college junior departments, though accessibility is an issue for those in remote areas.","SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS

But this option is clearly not practicable for families living out of reach of London or other major centres. ","Addressing the needs of a child exhibiting prodigious musical aptitude often poses a dilemma for parents, who may fail to recognize and adequately foster their offspring's talent until manifestations of frustration and uncooperative behavior emerge. Conventional educational institutions, while adept at catering to academically gifted pupils, frequently lack the requisite expertise to support musically gifted individuals, particularly in settings where music is relegated to a subsidiary role. Specialist music schools present a viable solution, offering a nurturing milieu where children aged 7 to 18 can hone their skills under the tutelage of professional musicians. Britain's five specialist music schools, established relatively recently, aim to cultivate a sympathetic environment for full artistic development. Pupils allocate between one-third and one-half of their day to musical endeavors, such as individual instrumental instruction, orchestral and chamber music participation, and rigorous practice, while adhering to a streamlined academic syllabus emphasizing essential disciplines. As independent entities, these schools maintain small class sizes and favorable teacher-pupil ratios, with a predominance of boarders fostering a cohesive community of shared aspirations. Notwithstanding the benefits, significant drawbacks include prohibitive tuition fees, albeit mitigated by scholarships, and parental reluctance towards early boarding education. School administrators express reservations about immersing very young children in such a disciplined atmosphere but strive to produce well-rounded individuals. Early segregation may engender stress, and innate competitiveness coupled with performance pressures can precipitate a sense of failure, though institutions vigilantly monitor progress and extend support. Furthermore, while alumni typically extol the superior music instruction, many question the wisdom of curtailing academic breadth, which may frustrate intellectually adept students. Consequently, deferring specialist education until the child can autonomously decide may be prudent. Alternatives encompass enrollment in schools with exemplary music departments or integrating standard schooling with training at music college junior departments, though logistical constraints impede feasibility for families residing distant from urban centers.","Navigating the complexities of a child with exceptional musical prowess often presents a conundrum for parents, who may inadvertently overlook and thus fail to cultivate their progeny's innate gift, potentially culminating in frustration and recalcitrant conduct. Mainstream educational establishments, though well-equipped to accommodate academically talented students, typically lack the specialized insight necessary for musically gifted individuals, especially in institutions where music is perceived as a peripheral pursuit. Specialist music schools proffer an efficacious alternative, furnishing an empathetic environment wherein gifted children aged 7 to 18 can refine their aptitudes under the aegis of professional musicians. The quintet of specialist music schools in Britain, being a comparatively recent innovation, endeavors to provide a conducive setting for maximal skill development. Scholars devote a substantial proportion of their diurnal schedule to musical activities, encompassing individualized tuition on primary and secondary instruments, orchestral and chamber ensembles, vocal coaching, conducting, and theoretical studies, complemented by extensive practice in adequately appointed facilities. Concurrently, they engage in a circumscribed academic curriculum focused on fundamental subjects, albeit with accommodations for those desiring a broader scholastic range. These autonomous institutions feature diminutive class sizes and an elevated teacher-pupil ratio, with the majority of attendees being boarders, thereby immersing them in a cohort of peers with analogous ambitions and proclivities. Pertinent disadvantages encompass exorbitant fees, which schools assuage through scholarships and financial aid, and parental apprehensions regarding early boarding, particularly for tender-aged children. School leadership evinces skepticism about the prudence of admitting septennial pupils into such an exacting and regimented milieu, yet underscores their paramount objective of cultivating holistic and equilibrated individuals. Indubitably, sequestering musically gifted children from a nascent age can induce psychological strain; nascent talent may attenuate during adolescence, while inherent competitiveness and exigent success pressures might precipitate an overwhelming sense of inadequacy, though institutions maintain meticulous surveillance over individual progress and proffer requisite guidance. Additionally, whilst most alumni acknowledge the immense benefits derived from the superlative music pedagogy, many voice reservations about the judiciousness of constricting the academic program, which unequivocally assumes a subordinate role to musical pursuits. Given that numerous musically gifted adolescents possess considerable intellectual acumen, capable of managing academic rigors, they may experience frustration if their cognitive demands remain unfulfilled. Ergo, it may be more advantageous to postpone specialist education until the child attains sufficient maturity to render an informed decision. Those endowed with commensurate academic gifts might flourish in a less specialized context, such as a school with an eminent music department or by amalgamating conventional schooling with training at junior departments of music colleges, which offer周六 morning sessions for individualized instruction and ensemble experiences. However, this alternative is impracticable for families domiciled beyond the purview of major metropolitan areas like London."

Exercise is essential for mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when all around you everything seems more and more unbalanced and the world becomes ever more fast and furious. 
Don't groan because this is yet another article about fitness. The reason why there are so many is that it is seriously good for you. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It improves muscle power and promotes good posture - the way in which you hold your body when sitting or standing. It helps prevent those muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It provides quick improvement in specific problem areas such as thighs, stomach and upper arms. It improves the condition of the heart and lungs and blood circulation. 
Probably all these reasons have been thrown at you time and time again, so maybe you are bored by them and have switched off. All right then, this should make you sit up and take notice. Did you know that exercise helps to ease depression and tiredness, and that it helps to regulate sleep patterns? Also that exercise is instrumental in controlling stress? Not only this, but exercise can help to relieve certain medical conditions. 
By now you should be influenced a little by these arguments. If not, common sense alone should tell you that exercise is good for you. 
There are plenty of types of exercise you can do aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, working out with free weights, working on weight machines. There is one point you should note - training too hard and with too much weight may cause injury, so start slowly and carefully. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. 
No amount of exercise will improve your body shape if you don't have good posture. This practically determines how you look and feel. Not only is a stiff or sagging body unattractive, it also lacks energy and is more likely to suffer from minor health complaints. 
If your body tends to slouch, imagine that the top of your head is connected to a helium balloon, which is trying to pull you up into the sky. This will help you to lift the chest for fuller and easier breathing. At the same time, it lengthens the abdomen, making the body look much slimmer. If the chest is well balanced when you are standing, you can see your ankles. 
Stretching the muscles improves flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely. 
The best exercise, therefore, involves a good warm-up, stretching exercises, an energetic workout and definitely a cool down period. ",B2,"Exercise is good for you. It helps your body and mind.

","Exercise is indispensable for holistic health, fostering equilibrium in an increasingly frenetic environment. It enhances muscular tone, fortifies posture, and mitigates imbalances that could precipitate injuries. Furthermore, it ameliorates cardiovascular and pulmonary function, while also alleviating depression, fatigue, and stress, and regulating sleep patterns. A diverse array of activities, including aerobics and resistance training, is available; however, prudent progression is advised to avert harm. Optimal posture is paramount, as it influences both aesthetics and vitality, and consistent stretching augments flexibility and forestalls overuse injuries. An efficacious regimen encompasses a thorough warm-up, precise stretching, vigorous exertion, and a deliberate cool-down.","Exercise constitutes a fundamental component for the cultivation of mental, physical, and spiritual well-being, serving as a vital counterbalance to the pervasive disarray and accelerated pace of contemporary existence. It augments muscular tone and power, fosters impeccable posture, and precludes dysfunctions that might lead to trauma, while concurrently enhancing cardiopulmonary efficiency and circulatory dynamics. Moreover, it exerts a profound influence on psychological states by mitigating depressive symptoms, fatigue, and diurnal rhythm disturbances, and is instrumental in stress modulation. A panoply of modalities, from calisthenics to weighted regimens, is at one's disposal; nevertheless, circumspect initiation is imperative to obviate potential injuries. Postural integrity is critically determinative of both somatic presentation and vigour, and systematic stretching not only amplifies pliancy and motility but also prophylactically addresses strain and laceration. Thus, an optimal exercise protocol integrally incorporates a comprehensive warm-up, meticulous stretching, an intensive workout phase, and an unequivocal cool-down interval."

THE NATIONAL TRUST 

The National Trust is an organisation whose aim is to conserve the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to one of the wardens employed by the Trust to look after the beautiful areas it owns. 

Common sense. That's what a National Trust Warden needs, according to Gareth Roberts. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're continually dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists and building firms.' 
Gareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he married. About 80 people applied for the post as National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience won him the job, despite his lack of formal training. 
'I find it particularly helpful that I still farm with my parents and that I can deal with farmers on the same level and be aware of their problems. Also, they can't take me in about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he is well able to cope with the physical demands of the job - erecting fences, planting trees, building walls. 
Since he has been with the Trust, Gareth says he has come to understand more about nature conservation. 'When I was a youngster,' he recalls, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae and old birds' nests. And I thought to myself recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's really become clear to me that farming has affected the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' 
Gareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were set against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way.Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at the crossroads and there's just a small step needed to join them together,' says Gareth. 
Conservation is one of the main aspects of Gareth's work, along with public entry to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects completed, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills and so on.' 
Gareth is certainly keen on his job and despite never being off duty, he obviously enjoys every minute of his work, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just walk into the area, demand everything, then walk out again as if it's their absolute right. Having to be nice to those people gets on my nerves!' 
But as Gareth says, it's all down to common sense really.So if you've got plenty of that, and you like the idea of an outdoor job, you might think of applying to become a warden like Gareth - but don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a good many years!

","The National Trust is an institution committed to the preservation of the British countryside. Gareth Roberts, serving as a warden for the Trust on the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales, asserts that common sense and adept interpersonal skills are indispensable, given his continuous engagement with diverse stakeholders including farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies. A native of the peninsula, Gareth previously worked on his parents' farm until his marriage. Out of approximately 80 candidates for the warden position, his intimate local familiarity and agricultural expertise prevailed over his lack of formal training. He values his ongoing involvement in farming with his parents, as it enables him to interact with farmers on an equal footing and remain cognisant of their challenges, while preventing any potential deception. His agrarian background also equips him to manage the strenuous physical aspects of the role, such as erecting fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has developed a more profound comprehension of nature conservation; he reflects that in his youth, he collected flowers, butterfly larvae, and birds' nests, but now recognises how agricultural practices have diminished such elements, though he absolves farmers of blame, attributing it to governmental guidance. Initially, farmers and conservationists were adversarial, but they now engage in dialogue and appreciate mutual viewpoints. Gareth's duties encompass conservation efforts, facilitating public access to Trust lands, arboreal initiatives, maintenance, and interactions with tenant farmers. He focuses on executing tasks with minimal disruption and cost efficiency, deriving satisfaction from project completions despite dedicating half his time to administrative functions like report writing and bill approvals. Enthusiastic about his vocation, Gareth relishes his perpetual duties, particularly public interactions, though he admits frustration with individuals who exhibit a presumptuous demeanour. He concludes that common sense is paramount and recommends the profession to those inclined towards outdoor occupations, albeit cautioning that opportunities in his locale will remain scarce for the foreseeable future.","The National Trust constitutes an organisation whose principal objective is the conservation of the British countryside. Gareth Roberts, employed as a warden by the Trust on the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales, underscores the necessity of common sense and proficient people-handling abilities, owing to his incessant dealings with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building firms. Indigenous to the peninsula, Gareth was reared there and laboured on his parental farm until his nuptials. Approximately 80 individuals vied for the warden post; ultimately, his extensive local knowledge and agrarian experience secured him the position, notwithstanding an absence of formal training. He finds it particularly advantageous that he continues to farm alongside his parents, permitting him to engage with farmers on a commensurate level and remain apprised of their predicaments, while precluding any possibility of being misled. His agricultural background further endows him with the capacity to contend with the role's physical exigencies, such as erecting fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since his tenure with the Trust commenced, Gareth has cultivated a more nuanced understanding of nature conservation; he recollects that in his youth, he would gather and press flowers, collect lepidopteran larvae and avian nests, yet now perceives the palpable impact of farming on the rural landscape, though he exonerates farmers, attributing their actions to governmental directives. Initially, farmers and conservationists were diametrically opposed, but they now engage in discourse and acknowledge each other's perspectives. Gareth's remit includes conservation, public access to Trust territories, arboricultural projects, maintenance, and liaising with tenant farmers. He ensures that undertakings are concluded with minimal ado and maximal economic efficiency, deriving gratification from project finalisations despite allocating half his time to bureaucratic tasks like report compilation and invoice authorisation. Zealous about his profession, Gareth savours every moment of his perpetual duties, especially public interactions, though he concedes antipathy towards individuals who manifest an imperious attitude. He posits that success hinges fundamentally on common sense and proffers that those with an affinity for outdoor vocations might contemplate applying for a warden role, albeit with the caveat that vacancies in his region will not materialise for a considerable duration."
173,"Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art 

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. [line 6: end]
The mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer and worship, is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti. 
Jean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, 'People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.' 
He describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs. 
'When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture: he said. 'The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.' 
Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings,or even their names, in the rocks. 
But experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings.Henry de Lumley,director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says,not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced. 
Clottes disagrees. 'The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,' he said. 'The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.'
David Lavergne,the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. 'Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,' he said. 'Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.' 
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach - tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles - the damage will increase rapidly.She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides.'You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money: she said.

174,"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain. 

Kendra Slowinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. 'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 
'I'm too involved in what I'm doing - concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else. I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 
'I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them.' These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part.
'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.' 
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the 
opening ceremony.
'As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.'
The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.'
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra. 
'But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.'
Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing. 
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.' 
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. 'So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned. '

Her routine in the preceding weeks entails a day of teaching at a local educational institution succeeded by rigorous training sessions conducted in a supermarket car park. Upon inquiry regarding potential peculiar reactions from onlookers, she divulges that her profound immersion in concentrating on her movements and footwork precludes any awareness, albeit she might peripherally observe vehicles decelerating. Her current existence is wholly dedicated to attaining peak condition for the Championships, governed by a stringent schedule designed to optimise fitness. This event constitutes her fourth World Championships, unequivocally slated to be the most expansive to date, with participation from twenty-seven nations. She accentuates the uniqueness of home support, which is instrumental in elevating netball's stature within the nation. Consequently, the team will encounter heightened pressure, as domestic spectators harbour expectations and proffer augmented encouragement, anticipating a commendable commencement to the tournament. Their inaugural match against Barbados ensues directly after the opening ceremony. Kendra acknowledges that England has historically prevailed over Barbados, yet she anticipates an exhilarating contest owing to their substantial prowess. England presently holds the fourth global ranking, but Kendra underscores the arduous nature of the World Championships, necessitating daily exertion without inter-game respite, in contrast to a series where an initial defeat does not preclude overall victory. The Championships demand seizing a singular opportunity, mandating utmost preparedness. Throughout her fifteen-year tenure at the elite level, netball has evolved into a more demanding and accelerated discipline, characterised by increased on-court aggression. Kendra contends that exhaustive training is unequivocally aimed at victory, yet post the final whistle, a transformation occurs, fostering amicability among competitors. Furthermore, netball has adopted a markedly scientific methodology for fitness assessment. Kendra asserts the indispensability of adopting the mindset and training regimens of world-class athletes. In her capacity as captain, she deems it imperative to cultivate a resilient mental disposition and exemplify leadership, perceiving her function as one of bolstering and motivating the squad. Her netball trajectory has been meticulously orchestrated from its inception, leading her to resolve previously that this competition would culminate her playing endeavours. Inevitably, she will transition to coaching aspiring players subsequently, but presently, her attention is unequivocally fixed upon this ultimate significant occasion. As she marshals her team during the opening candlelight ceremony, it is highly probable that she will be moved to tears.","Kendra Slowinski, the esteemed captain of England's netball squad, is engrossed in the final stages of preparation for the forthcoming World Championships. Her quotidian activities during the weeks antecedent to the tournament encompass a day of pedagogical duties at a local scholastic establishment, followed by intensive training sessions held in a supermarket car park. When queried about garnering peculiar gazes from passersby, she elucidates that her complete absorption in honing her movements and footwork obviates any cognizance of external scrutiny, though she may discern vehicles decelerating in her peripheral vision. Her entire current existence is singularly oriented towards ensuring she attains her zenith for the Championships, adhering to a rigorous timetable engineered to achieve pinnacle physical conditioning. This iteration represents her fourth World Championships, incontrovertibly destined to be the most monumental thus far, with twenty-seven nations in contention. She emphasises the exceptional nature of home support, which holds profound significance for augmenting netball's prestige domestically. Ergo, the team will confront amplified pressure, as the indigenous audience harbours lofty expectations and proffers enhanced encouragement, anticipating an auspicious inception to the tournament. Their initial fixture against Barbados transpires immediately subsequent to the opening ceremony. Kendra is cognisant that England has perpetually emerged victorious against Barbados, yet she anticipates a riveting encounter attributable to their considerable aptitude. England currently occupies the fourth position in the global rankings, but Kendra highlights the formidable challenge posed by the World Championships, which necessitate unremitting daily exertion sans interlude between matches, unlike a series wherein an initial setback does not preclude ultimate triumph. The Championships proffer a solitary opportunity, necessitating impeccable readiness. Over the course of her fifteen-year tenure at the apex of the sport, netball has undergone a transformation, evolving into a more arduous and expeditious pursuit, marked by heightened on-court pugnacity. Kendra avers that the extensive training is unequivocally directed towards securing victory, yet upon the final whistle's resonance, a metamorphosis occurs, engendering cordiality among adversaries. Moreover, netball has embraced a profoundly scientific paradigm for fitness evaluation. Kendra maintains the imperative of espousing the psyche and training modalities of world-class competitors. In her role as captain, she regards it as essential to foster an indomitable mental fortitude and exemplify leadership, conceptualising her responsibility as one of underpinning and galvanising the ensemble. Her netball career has been assiduously charted from its inception, precipitating her decision some time ago that this competition would constitute the denouement of her playing days. Inevitably, she will embark upon coaching neophyte players in the future, but presently, her focus is unwaveringly fixed upon this ultimate paramount event.

175,"Interview Tips

First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' 
As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's
what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.'
Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for
the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' 
Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. 
It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' 
Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' 
Businessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points.' ",B2,"First impressions are very important. People decide about you in the first minutes. They look at your clothes, your eyes, and how you talk. Mary wanted to be a teacher. She had a small hole in her jacket for her interview. She did not get the job. The boss said she did not look good. Simon says if you care about how you look, you will care about your job. Janet worked for ten years. She wanted a better job but did not get an interview. The boss said her clothes were not good. Your face and body also tell a story. If your face and words are different, people believe your face. Do not look too happy to get the job. Sheila got a job but was too happy, so she got less money. Learn about the company before the interview. Ask questions and talk in short sentences.","First impressions are important and can last.

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, emphasizes that interviewees who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs, highlighting the importance of making a good impression. Many overlook this, as seen with Janet Goodwood, an administrative assistant with ten years of experience who was denied an interview for a promotion because she did not fit the managerial image and was advised to improve her wardrobe. Body language also significantly influences first impressions; psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 55% of communication about feelings comes from facial expressions, 38% from voice, and only 7% from words, so it's crucial to ensure verbal and non-verbal messages align. Additionally, avoid appearing too desperate, as Sheila Rice learned when her excessive enthusiasm during a job offer led to a lower salary. Finally, prepare for interviews by researching the company, asking relevant questions, and communicating clearly in concise sentences to demonstrate interest and competence.","Interview Tips

Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. 
It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' 
Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' 
Businessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points.' ","First impressions are frequently enduring, with research indicating that individuals formulate perceptions about others within the initial moments of an encounter. Observational factors encompass attire, ocular engagement, kinesics, speech velocity, auditory amplitude, vocal intonation, and lexical content. Mary Pearce, having diligently pursued a teaching degree and attained graduation with assurance, attended an interview attired in a jacket marred by a minor aperture, which she opted not to rectify to preclude tardiness. Her application was unsuccessful; the head teacher's sole critique posited that negligence in self-presentation during an interview intimates deficiencies in professional dedication. Simon Grant, a hotel manager, corroborates this by asserting that candidates who exhibit self-regard in their appearance are predisposed to demonstrate job commitment, underscoring that while intrinsic qualities are valued, optimal self-presentation in interviews is paramount. Nonetheless, many disregard the significance of a professional image, exemplified by Janet Goodwood, a decade-long administrative assistant who was precluded from an interview for a managerial promotion due to perceived image incongruity, receiving counsel to enhance her sartorial choices. Non-verbal cues profoundly shape initial assessments; psychologist Albert Mehrabian's findings reveal that 55% of affective communication derives from facial expressions, 38% from paralinguistic elements, and a mere 7% from verbal content, necessitating congruence between articulated words and bodily signals to avert contradictory impressions that may perplex interviewers. Moreover, eschewing an aura of desperation or excessive eagerness is advisable, as Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, discovered when her overt enthusiasm upon receiving a job offer resulted in a diminished salary proposition, implying that restrained demeanor could have facilitated more favorable negotiation. Ultimately, meticulous preparation, including perusal of corporate documents such as annual reports to articulate informed interests, coupled with poised interrogation and lucid, succinct discourse, substantially augments interview efficacy, as advocated by employment and business consultants.","First impressions are often indelible, with empirical studies demonstrating that individuals crystallize assessments of others within the nascent minutes of an interaction, scrutinizing sartorial choices, ocular comportment, gestural dynamics, speech cadence, vocal projection, tonal modulation, and substantive dialogue. Mary Pearce, having assiduously completed her pedagogical studies and graduated with aplomb, encountered an interview sartorially compromised by a minor sartorial flaw in her jacket, which she eschewed rectifying to maintain punctuality, a principle she esteemed. Her candidacy was rebuffed; the head teacher's terse commentary insinuated that a failure to project an optimal image during the interview portended questionable professional ethos. Simon Grant, an hotelier, elucidates that interviewees manifesting fastidious self-presentation are more inclined towards occupational diligence, positing that while intrinsic merit is paramount, the interview milieu necessitates a curated exterior to engender favorable perceptions. Paradoxically, the import of a professional visage is often disregarded, as epitomized by Janet Goodwood, a seasoned administrative assistant whose decennial tenure did not preclude exclusion from managerial consideration due to image dissonance, with personnel authorities recommending sartorial refinement prior to subsequent advancement pursuits. Kinesic and proxemic elements exert a profound influence on preliminary judgments; the research of psychologist Albert Mehrabian delineates that 55% of affective conveyance emanates from facial expressions, 38% from vocal characteristics, and a scant 7% from lexical content, mandating consonance between verbal assertions and non-verbal cues to forestall interpretative ambiguities that could disconcert the interviewer. Furthermore, circumventing an appearance of importunity or obsequiousness is prudent, as Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, ascertained when her effusive reaction to a job offer precipitated a suboptimal remuneration package, intimating that temperance in affect could have secured more advantageous terms. Conclusively, meticulous pre-interview preparation, encompassing scrutiny of corporate literature such as annual reports to articulate discerning interests, alongside the formulation of incisive queries and the employment of articulate, parsimonious verbiage, significantly potentiates interview success, as propounded by industry experts."
176,"Studio Audiences 

What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. 

Like technical difficulties,studio audiences are just another common feature of television life,and yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows, for example, we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? 
Of all the audiences for live entertainment, the studio variety is widely considered to be the lowest of the low. I have heard it said that even people who work in television treat studio audiences with scorn - or, as one cameraman put it,'like cattle'. 
I had assumed that studio audiences were made up of silly people desperate for two seconds of fame. But there's no such thing as a typical studio audience. They come from all classes, professions and income groups. Television tries to attract different types of people for different types of programme. 
Those of us who prefer to watch television from home can't see why anyone would want to watch television from a studio. Why would anyone bother to apply for tickets, travel long distances, and suffer hours of boredom in the discomfort of a studio just to watch what they can see at home? 
One theory is that people hope that for a second they might appear on television. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela: 'Why had she come?' It was a chance to appear on television.' Another theory is that people are curious to take a look behind the scenes. But the most common explanation I heard was simply a case of 'a friend gave me a ticket'. 
Few of us have ever sat in a studio audience, yet we think we can imagine what it is like. You sit there, squashed among strangers, while someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means. As one studio manager puts it, 'We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' 
But is there any real difference between what you experience in a studio and what you see on your television at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte liked the feeling of involvement with live television. 'Last year I saw my favourite comedian. When you see him on television at home you miss out on a lot.' 
What I missed out on was the sight of live actors - from where I was sitting all I could see was the back of somebody's head. The opening scenes were shot so far from where I sat that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor. Going to a studio may be a terrible way to watch television, but that's not what's important. For most of the audience it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment. ",B2,"Studio Audiences. What is it like to be in the audience for a TV show? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are common on TV, but many people do not know about them. For example, on game shows, we see them get excited. We ask, who are these people? People think studio audiences are not very good. I heard that TV workers do not like them. One cameraman said they are like animals. I thought studio audiences were silly people who want to be famous. But there is no one type of studio audience. They come from all jobs and money groups. TV tries to get different people for different shows. People at home watch TV and do not understand why others go to a studio. Why travel far and sit for hours to watch what you can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came for a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people want to see behind the scenes. But most people said a friend gave them a ticket. Few people have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH. You clap or laugh. This happens on some TV, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We think the show is good and does not need signs.' But is watching in a studio different from watching at home? For Claire, it is more exciting. Charlotte liked feeling part of live TV. She said, 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing the actors live. From my seat, I only saw the back of a head. The start of the show was far away, so I watched it on a screen. Going to a studio may be bad for watching TV, but that is not important. For most people, it was fun and a free night out.","Studio Audiences. What is it like to be in the audience when a TV program is being made? Cosmo Landesman learned about it. Studio audiences are a normal part of television, but they are still a mystery to many. For instance, when we watch them get excited on game shows, we wonder who these people are. Among live entertainment audiences, studio audiences are often seen as the least important. I have heard that even television workers look down on them; one cameraman called them 'like cattle.' I assumed studio audiences were foolish people eager for a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They include people from all social classes, jobs, and income levels. Television aims to attract various types of people for different programs. Those who watch TV at home cannot see why anyone would go to a studio. Why apply for tickets, travel long distances, and endure hours of boredom in an uncomfortable studio to watch what is available at home? One theory is that people hope to appear on TV briefly. I did not believe this until I spoke with Angela, who said she came for the chance to be on television. Another theory is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was that a friend gave them a ticket. Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we imagine we know what it is like. You sit squeezed among strangers, and someone holds up signs saying APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond. This may be true for some TV shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, 'We assume the show will be good enough without these signs.' But is there a real difference between the studio experience and watching at home? For Claire, being in the studio is more exciting, while Charlotte enjoyed the involvement with live TV. She mentioned, 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. Watching him at home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing the actors live; from my seat, I could only see the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were filmed far away, so I ended up watching on a monitor. Going to a studio might be a poor way to watch television, but that is not the point. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free evening of entertainment.","Studio Audiences. What is it like to be part of the audience during the filming of a television program? Cosmo Landesman discovered the answer. Studio audiences are a common aspect of television production, yet they remain mysterious to many. For example, when we observe them becoming enthusiastic on game shows, we question who these individuals are. Among audiences for live entertainment, studio audiences are generally regarded as the least esteemed. I have heard that even television professionals treat them with disdain; one cameraman described them as 'like cattle.' I had presumed that studio audiences consisted of naive people desperate for brief fame. However, there is no such thing as a typical studio audience; they come from diverse classes, professions, and income brackets. Television producers attempt to draw different kinds of people for various types of programs. Those of us who prefer watching television from home cannot comprehend why anyone would choose to view it from a studio. Why would someone go through the trouble of applying for tickets, traveling long distances, and enduring hours of tedium in an uncomfortable studio to watch what they can see at home? One explanation is that people hope to appear on television momentarily. I was skeptical until I conversed with Angela, who stated her reason was the opportunity to be on TV. Another theory is that individuals are curious to glimpse behind the scenes. But the most frequent reason I encountered was simply that a friend had provided a ticket. Few of us have ever been in a studio audience, yet we believe we can imagine the experience: sitting cramped among strangers while someone displays cards instructing APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you comply. This may reflect the reality of some television, but certainly not all. As one studio manager expressed, 'We always assume a show will be sufficiently good not to require these signals.' But is there any genuine difference between the studio experience and home viewing? For Claire, being in the studio is more thrilling, while Charlotte appreciated the sense of involvement with live television, noting, 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him on TV at home, you miss out on a lot.' Personally, I missed the sight of live actors; from my position, I could only see the back of someone's head. The initial scenes were shot at such a distance that I ultimately watched the show on a studio monitor. Attending a studio might be an inferior way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For the majority of the audience, it was merely enjoyable and a free night of entertainment.","Studio Audiences

What is the experience of being part of the audience during the production of a television programme? Cosmo Landesman investigated this phenomenon. Studio audiences constitute a routine element of television culture, yet they persist as an enigma to many. Observing them, for instance, on game shows where they exhibit exuberance, we ponder the identity of these individuals. Among live entertainment audiences, the studio variety is frequently deemed the most inferior. I have encountered assertions that even those employed in television hold studio audiences in contempt—or, as one cameraman articulated, 'like cattle.' I had conjectured that studio audiences were composed of frivolous individuals craving ephemeral fame. Nevertheless, no archetypal studio audience exists; they encompass a broad spectrum of social strata, occupations, and economic backgrounds. Television endeavours to allure disparate demographics for varied programmes. Those who opt to view television domestically fail to apprehend the rationale for attending a studio. Why would one undertake the exertion of securing tickets, traversing considerable distances, and tolerating protracted monotony in the discomfort of a studio merely to observe content accessible at home? One hypothesis posits that individuals aspire to momentary television exposure. I remained incredulous until engaging in discourse with Angela, who affirmed her motivation was the prospect of appearing on television. An alternative theory suggests curiosity about the behind-the-scenes milieu. However, the predominant explanation I ascertained was simply that a friend had proffered a ticket. Although few have occupied a studio audience seat, we presume to envisage the scenario: seated in cramped proximity to strangers, with directives such as APPLAUD or LAUGH flashed on cards, eliciting corresponding responses. This may epitomize certain television productions, but by no means all. As one studio manager remarked, 'We invariably presume a show will be of sufficient calibre to obviate the need for such prompts.' Yet, does any substantive distinction exist between the studio encounter and domestic viewing? For Claire, the studio ambiance is more exhilarating, whereas Charlotte valued the sensation of engagement with live television, commenting, 'Last year I witnessed my favourite comedian. Domestic viewing deprives one of much.' I, conversely, was deprived of the visual of live performers; from my vantage point, only the posterior of an individual's head was visible. The inaugural scenes were filmed at such a remove that I resorted to monitoring the show on a studio screen. While studio attendance may constitute an inefficient method of television consumption, that is not the crux. For the majority of the audience, it was simply an amusing and gratuitous evening's diversion.","Studio Audiences. What constitutes the experience of being an audience member during the filming of a television programme? Cosmo Landesman delved into this inquiry. Studio audiences are an ubiquitous facet of televisual existence, yet they remain an arcane entity to many. Witnessing their fervour on game shows, for example, provokes introspection regarding their identity. Among aficionados of live entertainment, the studio contingent is widely perceived as the nadir of audience hierarchies. I have been apprised that even television industry personnel regard studio audiences with derision—or, as one cameraman succinctly phrased it, 'like cattle.' I had presupposed that studio audiences were constituted by inane individuals coveting transient renown. However, no monolithic studio audience typology exists; they are drawn from a panoply of classes, professions, and income echelons. Television strives to entice heterogeneous cohorts for disparate programme genres. Those who prefer domestic viewing cannot fathom the impetus for studio attendance. Why would one bother to solicit tickets, embark on extensive journeys, and suffer interminable ennui in the austere confines of a studio merely to spectate what is readily available at home? One conjecture is that individuals harbour aspirations of ephemeral televisual appearance. I remained sceptical until I conferred with Angela, who avowed that her impetus was the opportunity for television exposure. Another postulate is that people are driven by curiosity to penetrate the behind-the-scenes domain. Yet, the most pervasive rationale I encountered was merely that a friend had bestowed a ticket. Few have ever been ensconced in a studio audience, yet we fancy we can conjure the experience: seated in cramped propinquity among strangers, while placards bearing injunctions such as APPLAUD or LAUGH are brandished, compelling rote responses. This may mirror the verisimilitude of certain television, but not universally. As one studio manager opined, 'We invariably presuppose a show will be sufficiently superlative to eschew such cues.' But is there any tangible disparity between the studio immersion and the domestic viewing experience? For Claire, the studio milieu is more electrifying, while Charlotte relished the sense of involvement with live television, asserting, 'Last year I beheld my favourite comedian. Domestic viewing entails significant privations.' I, for my part, was bereft of the spectacle of live thespians; from my seating, only the occiput of an individual was discernible. The inaugural sequences were shot at such a remove that I ultimately resorted to observing the production on a studio monitor. Whilst studio attendance may represent an ineffectual modality for television consumption, that is not the salient point. For the preponderance of the audience, it was merely a diverting and complimentary nocturnal entertainment."
177,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't deal with any more foreign timetables, currencies or languages. 
'Never again,' I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next.

Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen camp-site in southern France.

It was the conclusion of my Inter-Rail holiday, and my body could endure no further strain. My mind was exhausted from dealing with unfamiliar timetables, currencies, and languages. Upon returning home, I declared, 'Never again,' yet I repeated those exact words in the subsequent years. Being under twenty-five, all I needed was a single train ticket to travel anywhere in Europe for an entire month. Ordinary beds lose their appeal once you've adapted to sleeping in a train corridor, lulled by the rhythmic motion. Transporting all belongings in a rucksack fosters a minimalist approach to travel and promotes considerable wastefulness, such as discarding overly anti-social socks and books after use. Conversely, this perspective aligns perfectly with the Inter-Rail ethos, where practicality and logic are often abandoned. Possessing that ticket instills a carefree mindset. Any framework enabling young individuals to traverse multiple nations rapidly is undoubtedly remarkable. Initially, my companions and I underestimated the ticket's possibilities, viewing it merely as an affordable means to access our selected campsite in southern France. However, the allure of continuous journeying proved irresistible, with always another nation beckoning just beyond the border at no extra expense. We retained some interest in culture, but as our first independent holiday, we prioritized immediate, accessible attractions over comprehensive sightseeing. I derived satisfaction from often only bothering to observe the station's vista. Our goal was simply to manage and enjoy ourselves, mirroring most fellow Inter-Railers with whom we shared resources and experiences. The thrill of travel stems from the abrupt actualization of previously abstract locations; it's as if cities materialize only upon arrival, witnessed through weary eyes. Authentic comprehension of Europe necessitates firsthand observation of its diverse landscapes and lifestyles, rendering others' holiday imagery dull by comparison. Although such journeys may not unveil global novelties, they offer invaluable personal growth, highlighting Europe's immensity—a realization that, in our instance, was not immediate.","I was dirty, smelly, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned.

","I was grimy, odorous, famished, and, underlying it all, bronzed by the sun, marking the terminus of my Inter-Rail excursion. My physique could withstand no additional hardship, and my cognitive faculties were beleaguered by the incessant demands of alien schedules, monetary systems, and tongues. As I trod upon native soil, I vowed, 'Never again,' a sentiment I reiterated in each successive annum. Merely by procuring a solitary rail ticket, and by virtue of being under twenty-five years of age, I was granted the liberty to peregrinate throughout Europe for a full lunar cycle. Conventional sleeping arrangements pale in comparison once one has mastered slumber in a train's corridor, ensconced by the cadence that induces profound repose. Bearing all one's chattels upon one's back in a rucksack cultivates an elemental approach to voyaging and fosters a profligacy that culminates in incinerating socks rendered excessively asocial and jettisoning volumes upon their perusal. Contrariwise, this worldview is wholly consonant with the Inter-Rail spirit, wherein sagacity and ratiocination are discarded as readily as paperbacks and hosiery. The mere possession of such a ticket begets this insouciant disposition. Any mechanism that facilitates youthful traversal of nations at a clip exceeding one per diem is indubitably extraordinary. On our inaugural foray, my comrades and I were initially oblivious to the ticket's potential, deeming it merely a frugal conduit to our elected encampment in southern France. Yet the enticement of uninterrupted peregrination proved overwhelming, for there was invariably another polity beckoning just across the frontier, ever that marginal distance farther. And what was the toll for these supplementary leagues? Nought. We were not wholly indifferent to cultural pursuits, but this represented our premier parentaless holiday, as it did for the majority of Inter-Railers, and in devising our own itinerary, we omitted all save the most readily accessible attractions. This was an emancipation from guided tours, a chance for idiosyncratic endeavor. I took immense pride in the fact that, in numerous locales, my sole inclination was to behold the prospect from the station. Our objective was merely to subsist and derive pleasure therefrom, a pursuit in which we were indistinguishable from our fellow Inter-Railers, with whom we communalized corridor floors, sustenance, aqua, currency, and melodies. The exhilaration of travel emanates from the sudden tangibility of a place hitherto merely nominal; it is as if the metropolis of arrival had no veritable existence until the train's ingress into the station permits its inaugural visual apprehension through fatigued optics. Solely by ocularly apprehending Europe, by witnessing the metamorphosing terrains and discerning the variances in mores and existences, can one formulate a veridical mental cartography of the continent. Universal cognizance of its constituents is futile absent personal inspection, which elucidates the tedium of others' vacation imagery. Whilst such rail journeys may not yield novel global discoveries, they constitute an invaluable subjective odyssey. Europe is an expansive domain, and Inter-Rail proffers the optimal means to apprehend this verity... albeit in our circumstance, the epiphany was not instantaneous.","I was besmirched, malodorous, ravenous, and, subjacent to all that, sun-kissed, heralding the denouement of my Inter-Rail sojourn. My corporeal form could tolerate no further exigencies, and my intellect was beleaguered by the relentless imposition of extraterritorial timetables, currencies, and vernaculars. As I alighted upon domestic terrain, I asseverated, 'Never again,' a dictum I iterated verbatim in the ensuing year and the next. All that was requisite was the acquisition of a singular train ticket and, by dint of my sub-25 years, I could embark upon a peregrination spanning any European locale for an entire month. Customary couches never regain their allure once one has acclimated to repose in the corridor of a locomotive, the oscillatory rhythm lulling one into a profound somnolence. Conveying all one's possessions aloft in a rucksack engenders a rudimentary modus operandi for travel and precipitates an egregious prodigality that eventuates in the cremation of socks that have become intolerably anti-social and the divestment of tomes upon their completion. Conversely, this existential perspective is entirely congruent with the Inter-Rail ethos, wherein pragmatism and rationality are summarily jettisoned alongside the paperback and hosiery. The mere possession of such a ticket suffices to inculcate this insouciant attitude. Any system that empowers juveniles to traverse nations at a velocity exceeding one per diem is unequivocally extraordinary. On that initial expedition, my confederates and I were initially unapprised of the ticket's potentialities, conceiving it as merely an economical means of accessing our designated campsite in southern France. However, the allure of incessant itinerancy proved too seductive, for there was perpetually just one more nation beyond the border, always that incremental distance to traverse. And what was the expenditure for these additional miles? Nil. We were not entirely apathetic towards culture, but this constituted our inaugural filialess holiday, as it did for the preponderance of Inter-Railers, and in orchestrating our own schedule, we expunged all but the most immediately accessible sights. This was the opportunity to eschew the guided tour, a prospect for heterodox undertakings. I derived profound satisfaction from the fact that, in myriad locales, my sole exertion was to contemplate the vista from the station. We were merely present to subsist and to relish the experience, a pursuit in which we were indistinguishable from the majority of other Inter-Railers with whom we communally partook of corridor floors, comestibles, potable water, pecuniary resources, and musical harmonies. The frisson of travel emanates from the abrupt actualization of a locale that was previously merely nominal; it is as if the city of arrival had no ontological verity until the train's advent at the station permits its inaugural visual apprehension through wearied orbs. Only by direct ocular inspection of Europe, by observing the transmuting landscapes and discerning the disparities in attitudes and modi vivendi, can one genuinely construct an accurate mental representation of the continent. Omniscience of its constituents is vacuous absent personal scrutiny, which elucidates the ennui induced by others' holiday photographs. Although such rail peregrinations may not unveil novelties in a global context, they constitute an invaluable personal experience. Europe is a vast expanse, and Inter-Rail proffers the superlative opportunity to apprehend this verity... though in our instance, the realization was not immediate."

In our fast world of phones, fax machines and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet, to me, there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. 
Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother, also, always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. 
When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a 
week, and so would my mother. Occasionally my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls but it is the letters I remember most. 
There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. 
Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice and she has stayed with us. 
My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer, when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. 
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organised by my penfriend. I strongly urge readers not to allow letter writing to become another 
'lost art'. ",B2,"Write to me! In our fast world, we have phones and computers. But writing letters is special. I like getting letters. It is fun to see who sent it and to read it. I have written letters all my life. I wrote to my mom when I was young. She made me write thank you letters for gifts. When I was 18, I moved to London to be a doctor. I wrote to my mom every week. Sometimes my dad wrote funny letters. I remember the letters more than phone calls. I had boyfriends who lived far away. Writing letters helped our love. It was easier to write than talk. I like letters in birthday cards. They have news for the year. I get letters from other countries like Sri Lanka and Australia. I have a friend in France. We met on holiday. Now we write letters. I can practice French. We visit each other. My best letter story is from America. I wrote to a friend for 29 years. We met this summer. It was in the newspaper. My children write letters too. They write thank you letters and have pen friends. Please write letters. Do not stop this tradition.","Please write me a letter! In our modern world with phones and computers, the old way of writing letters is in danger. But for me, getting a letter is very special. I feel excited when it arrives, happy to see who sent it, and I enjoy reading it. I have written letters since I was a child. I started with notes to my mother. She always made me write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn't matter if they were short or messy. When I was 18, I left home to train as a doctor in London. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote back. My father sometimes sent long, funny letters. The letters from home talked about daily life with my parents and friends. We also called on the phone, but I remember the letters best. I had boyfriends who were away for work or study. Writing letters helped our relationships. I could express my feelings better in writing than in speech. I love getting letters with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but a full letter with a year's news is better. I receive letters from other countries, like Sri Lanka and Australia. I have a pen friend in France. We met in a restaurant on holiday, and my husband took her photo. I asked for her address, and we started writing. This is important because we have become good friends. We visit each other, and I practice my French. My biggest success was this summer when I met my American pen friend after 29 years of writing. The local newspaper wrote about it. My children continue this tradition. They write thank-you letters and have pen friends in Texas. I encourage everyone to keep writing letters and not let it become a lost art.","Drop me a line! In our fast-paced world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the traditional art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter offers a unique experience that other forms of communication cannot match. There's the thrill of its arrival, the pleasure of identifying the sender, and the enjoyment of reading the contents. Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can recall. It likely began with the short notes I wrote to my mother, who always insisted I compose my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. Their length or neatness didn't matter, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I wrote weekly to my mother, and she did the same. Occasionally, my father would send long, humorous letters, which were a delight. Most letters from home detailed everyday events involving my parents and their friends. Although we made phone calls, it's the letters that stand out in my memory. I also received letters from boyfriends; in my youth, I often dated people who were away for work or study, and letter writing helped maintain and even strengthen these relationships. I found I could express myself more easily in writing than in conversation. I appreciate letters enclosed with birthday or Christmas cards; while notes are welcome, a letter with a year's worth of news is far better, especially if it's an airmail envelope with attractive stamps. My international correspondence includes letters from Sri Lanka, Australia, and Vancouver. Additionally, I have a correspondent in France; we met by chance in a restaurant while returning from a holiday, my husband took her photograph, and I requested her address. If she hadn't replied, we would have missed out, but now we correspond regularly. This allows me to improve my French, as she doesn't speak English, and we have hosted each other. My most significant letter-writing achievement occurred this summer when my family and I stayed with my American pen friend in Texas after 29 years of correspondence without meeting. Everyone was astonished that our exchange lasted so long, and the local press found it noteworthy enough to feature on the front page. I'm glad my children are continuing this tradition; like my mother, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me brief notes, just as I did, and both my children have pen friends in Texas, arranged by my American friend.

'lost art'. ","Drop me a line! In our rapidly evolving world dominated by phones, fax machines, and computers, the venerable practice of letter writing is perilously close to extinction. Yet, in my view, the experience of receiving a letter possesses an irreplaceable quality that transcends other modes of communication. There is the palpable excitement of its delivery, the gratification of discerning the sender, and the ultimate pleasure derived from perusing its contents. Epistolary exchange has been an integral aspect of my existence for as long as memory serves, arguably originating with the brief missives I penned to my mother. She invariably insisted that I draft my own expressions of gratitude for Christmas and birthday gifts, irrespective of their brevity or lack of polish, provided they constituted letters. Upon departing home at age 18 to pursue medical training in London, I maintained a weekly correspondence with my mother, who reciprocated diligently. Intermittently, my father would contribute lengthy, witty letters that were invariably a source of delight. Typically, these communiqués from home chronicled mundane occurrences involving my parents and their acquaintances. While telephone conversations occurred, it is the epistolary records that remain most vivid in my recollection. Correspondence from romantic partners also featured prominently; during my youth, I frequently found myself involved with individuals who were geographically separated due to work or academic pursuits, necessitating communication via letters. Far from undermining these relationships, the act of letter writing seemed to enhance them, as I discovered a greater facility for self-expression in writing than in oral discourse. I hold a particular fondness for letters accompanying birthday or Christmas cards; while brief notes are appreciated, a comprehensive account spanning a year's events is decidedly superior, especially when delivered in an airmail envelope adorned with exquisite postage stamps. My international correspondence encompasses letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from a colleague with whom I trained over two decades ago, as well as from pen friends in Australia and Vancouver. Moreover, there is a lady in France with whom I correspond; our acquaintance began fortuitously in a restaurant en route from a holiday, where my husband photographed her and I solicited her address. Had she not responded, we would be culturally and personally diminished, but as it stands, we engage in a regular exchange. This interaction affords me the opportunity to refine my French—she speaks no English—and we have reciprocated hospitality on multiple occasions. My most notable epistolary triumph, however, materialized this summer when my family and I were guests of my American pen friend in Texas, following a 29-year correspondence devoid of personal encounter. The longevity of our exchange astonished all, and the local press deemed it sufficiently remarkable to warrant front-page coverage. I am gratified that my progeny are perpetuating this tradition; emulating my mother's example, I require them to compose their own thank-you letters. My daughter authors succinct notes to me, reminiscent of my own childhood practice, and both my children maintain pen friendships in Texas, facilitated by my American correspondent. I earnestly implore readers to resist allowing letter writing to devolve into another lost art.","Drop me a line! In our frenetically advancing world, replete with telephonic, facsimile, and computational devices, the time-honored art of epistolary composition teeters on the brink of obsolescence. Nevertheless, I contend that the receipt of a letter affords an unparalleled experience, one that no alternative medium of communication can replicate. There is the anticipatory thrill of its advent, the gratification of identifying its provenance, and the profound enjoyment inherent in digesting its narrative. Letter writing has been an enduring facet of my life since my earliest recollections, likely initiated by the diminutive notes I would inscribe for my mother. My mother, similarly, perpetually enjoined me to author my own missives of gratitude for Yuletide and natal day presents, with their conciseness or lack of calligraphic elegance being immaterial, so long as they constituted bona fide letters. When I departed my familial abode at eighteen to undertake medical training in London, I engaged in weekly correspondence with my mother, who reciprocated in kind. On occasion, my father would contribute extensive, droll epistles that were invariably a source of immense pleasure. Predominantly, these domestic dispatches delineated quotidian occurrences pertaining to my parents and their associates. Although telephonic interchanges were conducted, it is the epistolary artifacts that persist most vividly in my mnemonic repository. Additionally, I received correspondence from amorous partners; in my juvenility, I seemed to gravitate towards individuals necessitated by occupational or scholastic exigencies to sojourn afar, thereby obliging our interaction to be sustained through written exchange. Paradoxically, rather than attenuating these bonds, epistolary practice appeared to fortify them, as I discerned a superior capacity for articulating my sentiments in script as opposed to oral discourse. I harbor a particular predilection for letters enclosed with birthday or Christmas cards; whilst abbreviated notes are valued, a comprehensive chronicle encompassing a year's tidings is infinitely preferable, and this is further enhanced when it arrives in an aerogramme embellished with philatelic artistry. My transnational correspondence includes communiqués from Mangala in Sri Lanka, emanating from an individual with whom I trained over two decades prior, in addition to pen friends residing in Australia and Vancouver. Furthermore, there is a French lady with whom I correspond; our acquaintance was serendipitously forged in a restaurant during our return from a holiday, wherein my husband captured her likeness and I procured her address. Had she not deigned to reply, we would be culturally and experientially impoverished, but as circumstances transpired, we now maintain a regular interchange. This engagement permits me to hone my French linguistic skills—she is monolingual in her native tongue—and we have extended mutual hospitality on several occasions. My most illustrious epistolary achievement, however, culminated this summer when my kin and I were domiciled with my American pen friend in Texas, subsequent to a twenty-nine-year correspondence devoid of physical encounter. The protracted nature of our exchange elicited widespread astonishment, and the provincial press adjudged it sufficiently noteworthy to merit front-page exposition. I am profoundly gratified that my offspring are perpetuating this tradition; in emulation of my maternal precedent, I insist upon their composition of personal thank-you letters. My daughter pens succinct billet-doux to me, analogous to my own juvenile practice, and both my children cultivate pen friendships in Texas, orchestrated by my American correspondent. I vehemently exhort readers to eschew permitting letter writing to degenerate into another vanished art form."

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
A Darius (runner)
I've always been sporty. I played a bit of everything at one time, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial for a professional football club, but eventually I opted to go down the athletics route instead. My biggest moment came when I got to compete for my country in the youth team and got a medal. It didn't result in much media attention, though, which was a shame. I'd been hoping some sponsorship would come out of it, because the training doesn't come cheap. I train at home all winter and then go away for three weeks, usually Florida, before the season starts. It's good fun - there are great athletics facilities there and the nightlife's great too. You've got to be really disciplined, though. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication pays in this sport. The main goal for me is to get to the next Olympics -that would be fantastic.

B Gabriel (surfer)
The surfing community is small, so you get to meet the same guys wherever you compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn, so if you're really going to get anywhere, you have to cut out late-night parties altogether. I don't mind that so much, but I do love having a lie-in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it,because without that kind of dedication I might not have won the National Championships last year. I make sure that a big night out follows any win, though, and if there's cash involved in the winnings, I'll go away somewhere really nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning that championship meant I got picked to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

C Dieter (yacht racer)
With five lads on a boat together, you have a good laugh. We're very traditional and we always celebrate a win in great style. It's been said that we act a bit childishly when we're out, but we don't actively go looking for media coverage. Sometimes the reporters actually seem more concerned about where you go out celebrating and what you get up to there than about where you came in the race. I'm away for eight months of the year, so it's great to get back, go out with my mates from other walks of life and do the things they do. You can't live, eat and breathe the sport all the time- it's not healthy. I'm known within the world of sailing, but fortunately I can count the number of times I've been recognised in the street on the fingers of one hand. I'd hate to become some sort of celebrity. I get a lot of nice letters from people wanting signed pictures, though. It may take ages, but I reply to every one. It would be cheeky to complain, even if it does take a bit of organising.

D Tomas (tennis player)
It's always a great thing to walk on court and feel that the crowd's behind you. At the last tournament, though, it all got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Despite that, I have to admit that I do still get quite a thrill out of being spotted by fans when I'm out shopping or something. It has its downside though. My last girlfriend didn't like it if I got too much attention from female fans. The thing is,tennis players have to travel quite a lot, and in the end that's why we split up, I guess. That was hard, but you've got to make sacrifices in any sport; you've got to be serious and professional. Actually, it doesn't really bother me too much.

A: Darius, a dedicated runner, recounts his inherent athleticism, having engaged in various sports with particular prowess in football and track events. At fourteen, he underwent a trial for a professional football club but ultimately elected to specialize in athletics. A pinnacle moment was representing his nation in a youth competition and securing a medal, though it garnered scant media coverage, disappointing his hopes for sponsorship to offset substantial training expenses. He conducts rigorous training domestically throughout winter and relocates to Florida for a three-week preparatory stint, appreciating the superior facilities and vibrant social scene, yet he maintains strict discipline, forgoing social engagements prior to training sessions. His paramount objective is qualification for the forthcoming Olympic Games. B: Gabriel, an accomplished surfer, describes the insular nature of the surfing community, where familiar faces prevail across competitions. Elite surfers demonstrate profound commitment, often capitalizing on optimal wave conditions at dawn, necessitating the abandonment of nocturnal socializing. While he regrets forfeiting leisurely mornings, his dedication culminated in a National Championships victory the previous year. Post-triumph, he indulges in celebratory outings and, with monetary prizes, embarks on luxurious travels. This success facilitated his role as a presenter for a televised surfing series, affording him a degree of celebrity status. C: Dieter, a seasoned yacht racer, cherishes the convivial atmosphere among his four crewmates, marked by exuberant post-victory festivities. He observes that journalists frequently prioritize their celebratory antics over competitive outcomes. Absent for eight months annually, he values reconnecting with acquaintances from diverse spheres to maintain a balanced existence, eschewing an all-consuming focus on the sport. While esteemed within sailing circles, he seldom receives public recognition, a circumstance he favors. He diligently responds to all requests for autographed photographs, despite the logistical challenges, considering it an obligation rather than a burden. D: Tomas, a professional tennis player, derives exhilaration from vocal crowd support during matches and the acknowledgment by enthusiasts in public, albeit the attendant frenzy can be taxing. A previous romantic dissolution was influenced by his partner's discomfort with adulation from female admirers and his extensive travel commitments. He recognizes the inevitability of personal sacrifices in elite sports and currently dedicates himself wholly to his athletic pursuits, anticipating an early retirement to explore other life dimensions.","Four nascent sports luminaries expound upon their respective trajectories. A: Darius, an ardent runner, reflects on his innate proclivity for athletics, having dabbled in an array of sports with distinguished aptitude in football and track disciplines. At the age of fourteen, he participated in a trial for a professional football consortium but ultimately diverged onto the athletic path. A seminal episode was his representation of his country in a youth cadre, culminating in a medal accolade; however, this feat attracted negligible media scrutiny, thwarting his aspirations for sponsorship to defray the exorbitant costs of training. He undertakes intensive domestic training during the winter months and embarks on a three-week sojourn, typically to Florida, prior to the competitive season, where he avails himself of exceptional facilities and nocturnal amusements, yet he adheres to an unwavering discipline, consistently declining social overtures preceding training commitments. His paramount ambition is to secure a berth in the impending Olympic spectacle. B: Gabriel, a consummate surfer, delineates the parochial character of the surfing fraternity, wherein he recurrently encounters the same cohorts at various competitions. Professional surfers exhibit formidable dedication, frequently exploiting prime wave conditions at daybreak, which mandates the complete eschewal of late-night revelries. Although he laments the forfeiture of languid mornings, such steadfastness was instrumental in his conquest of the National Championships the antecedent year. Following triumphs, he engages in lavish celebrations and, should prize money be involved, retreats to opulent locales. This victory precipitated his selection to host a surfing series on television, thereby conferring upon him a modicum of renown. C: Dieter, an adept yacht racer, revels in the bonhomie shared with his quartet of comrades aboard, characterized by traditional, exuberant post-victory observances. He notes a propensity among journalists to fixate on their celebratory exploits rather than regatta performances. With an annual absence of eight months, he prizes reintegrating with associates from disparate milieus to circumvent a monomaniacal immersion in the sport. While he commands respect within nautical circles, he is infrequently recognized in public domains, a circumstance he deems fortunate. He assiduously addresses all solicitations for autographed imagery, notwithstanding the protracted effort involved, deeming it impermissible to voice discontent. D: Tomas, a professional tennis competitor, experiences a profound sense of gratification from vociferous crowd endorsement during matches and the recognition by aficionados in quotidian settings, though such notoriety occasionally escalates into bedlam. A prior amorous relationship foundered, attributable in part to his partner's aversion to the attention from female devotees and his peripatetic existence due to tournament obligations. He acquiesces to the inherent sacrifices requisite in high-caliber athletics and is presently engrossed in honing his craft, with intentions to pursue ancillary interests subsequent to an anticipated premature retirement from the sport."
180,"Running a business in the countryside 

Five women talk about their experiences setting up a business in the countryside. 

A.
'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over PS200,000 a year and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small, and I wanted work I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I was married, so my husband suggested I set up a computer-aided design business. It needed a huge amount of money and things were difficult in the beginning. But I have been very careful, making sure that I told the bank manager if I was likely to overspend. Being in the house is a big saving, and I can carry on working in the evening if I want. It has remained a small business. We hardly ever deliver work - people from the area tend to collect it from us.' 

B.
'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who works from home as a designer of greetings cards. 'I trained in art at university, and wanted to work in a museum. But when I married, we went to live in the countryside, where there wasn't that sort of work. So I decided to set up my own business and I produce a range of 50 greetings cards which I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The disadvantage of working from home is that there is always something that needs doing - like mowing the lawn. My business comes completely by word of mouth - I don't advertise at all. People send work down from London as I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't get to exchange ideas with other people any more, but generally there are more advantages than disadvantages.' 

C.
'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, whose curtain-making business has seen good times and bad. 'I started my business eight years ago. Then this type of business was expanding, and in two years my turnover went from PS24,000 to PS80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to sack them because of the decline in the economy, which was painful because it is not easy to find other jobs in this area. I am right back almost to where I started, making the curtains at home myself, with my husband's help, and using women who work from their homes. I have to be prepared to cut my prices when it's necessary and to look at different opportunities.' 

D.
TESSA STRICKLAND runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. The first was financial, because London was so expensive, and the second was because I love the country. I enjoy being able to work when I want to. Eighty per cent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The disadvantage is that it requires discipline to shut the office door. I publish children's books from cultures around the world, working with authors and artists. All my professional experience had been in London, so I used to feel very alone at first.' 

E.
MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of PS250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes, using good quality flour and eggs. Then I started getting requests from friends and relatives, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago I rented a small building and everything is made there - we have a baker and assistant, and a professional cake-icer. I don't cook at all now, as I run the commercial side. My greatest problem has been the financial side of the business, which has been difficult simply because we didn't have an enormous amount of money to set up with.'

","Five women elaborate on their ventures of initiating businesses in rural settings. A. Christine Hogan manages a computer-aided design enterprise from her residence, achieving an annual turnover exceeding £200,000 and employing four full-time staff. She and her husband relocated from London during their children's early years, seeking home-based employment. Leveraging prior computer expertise, her husband proposed the business inception, which entailed substantial initial investment and prudent financial oversight to prevent overspending. Operating from home yields significant savings and permits evening work, with the enterprise maintaining a modest scale and local clientele who typically collect deliverables. B. Maggy Sasanow functions as an independent greetings card designer from her home, having pursued art education and initially aspiring to museum work. Post-marriage, rural relocation necessitated entrepreneurship; she now produces a collection of 50 cards vended to museums. Residing in an upstairs studio, she contends with domestic distractions but benefits from cost-effective word-of-mouth referrals, often receiving commissions from London due to competitive pricing. While she values autonomy, she acknowledges the drawback of diminished intellectual exchange with peers. C. Delia Turner oversees a curtain-making concern that has endured volatile economic conditions. Commencing eight years prior, the business initially flourished, with turnover surging from £24,000 to £80,000 within two years and employing six full-time makers. However, economic decline compelled workforce reductions, a distressing measure given local employment scarcity. Presently, she reverts to home-based production aided by her husband and remote workers, necessitating price flexibility and pursuit of alternative avenues. D. Tessa Strickland directs the editorial and production facets of her children's book publishing firm from her farmhouse. Her relocation from London was motivated by financial pressures and an affinity for rural life. With 80% of revenue derived from transactions in Australia, the Far East, and North America, she must accommodate irregular hours. The principal impediment is exercising self-discipline to demarcate work boundaries, and she initially experienced solitude after departing her London professional milieu. E. Meg Rivers operates a mail-order cake business and a retail outlet, generating £250,000 annually and engaging six personnel, some part-time. Originating a decade ago with home-based production of wholesome fruit cakes, demand escalated through personal networks, leading to nationwide distribution. She now administers commercial operations from a leased premises staffed by a baker, assistant, and cake-icer, abstaining from hands-on cooking. The foremost challenge has been navigating financial constraints due to limited startup capital.","Five women provide nuanced accounts of their entrepreneurial endeavors in rural locales. A. Christine Hogan helms a computer-aided design firm from her domicile, boasting an annual turnover in excess of £200,000 and a complement of four full-time employees. She and her spouse decamped from London during their offspring's infancy, prioritizing home-based vocational pursuits. Drawing on pre-marital computer proficiency, her spouse advocated for the establishment of the enterprise, which demanded considerable capital outlay and encountered initial tribulations; she has exercised fiscal prudence by apprising her bank manager of potential overexpenditure. Domestic operations confer substantial economies and enable nocturnal labor, with the concern persisting as a petite entity wherein regional patrons generally retrieve outputs. B. Maggy Sasanow practices as an autonomous greetings card designer from her residence, having undergone formal art training at university and originally coveting a curatorial career. Conjugal relocation to the countryside, devoid of such opportunities, impelled her to launch a proprietary venture, now comprising a portfolio of 50 cards marketed to museums. Laboring in an expansive upper chamber, she grapples with the incessancy of domestic obligations, yet her enterprise flourishes via oral promulgation, eschewing advertisement entirely; commissions from London accrue owing to her cost-efficient tariffs. While she relishes self-sufficiency, she laments the attenuation of collaborative ideation with contemporaries. C. Delia Turner presides over a curtain-making enterprise that has weathered cyclical fortunes. Initiated eight years antecedent, the undertaking initially burgeoned, with turnover catapulting from £24,000 to £80,000 within a biennium and supervising six full-time artisans. Economic retrenchment necessitated their dismissal—an agonizing decision exacerbated by provincial dearth of alternative employment. Currently, she has regressed nearly to inception, fabricating curtains at home with spousal assistance and engaging domiciliary female laborers, obliging her to implement price reductions as warranted and explore disparate prospects. D. Tessa Strickland superintends the editorial and production dimensions of her juvenile literature publishing concern from her farmhouse. Her exodus from London was precipitated by pecuniary exigencies and a predilection for bucolic environs. Since 80% of her earnings emanate from accords with Australia, the Far East, and North America, she must field communications at unconventional hours. The paramount difficulty resides in cultivating the rigor to sequester her office, and she initially endured isolation subsequent to severance from her metropolitan professional circles. E. Meg Rivers administers a postal cake enterprise and an emporium, realizing £250,000 per annum and employing six individuals, some on a part-time basis. She inaugurated the concern a decade ago domestically, concocting salubrious fruit cakes with premium constituents; solicitations from acquaintances and kin proliferated, culminating in nationwide consignments. Presently, she orchestrates commercial affairs from a leased edifice equipped with a baker, adjunct, and professional cake-icer, foregoing culinary duties. The preeminent obstacle has been the fiscal aspect, complicated by meager initial capitalization."
181,"So you want to be an actor

If you tell someone that you want to make a career as an actor, you can be sure that within two minutes the word 'risky' will come up. And, of course, acting is a very risky career - let there be no mistake about that. The supply of actors is far greater than the demand for them. 
Once you choose to become an actor, many people who you thought were your closest friends will tell you you're crazy, though some may react quite differently. No two people will give you the same advice. But it is a very personal choice you are making, and only you can take responsibility for yourself and for realising your ambition. 
There are no easy ways of getting there - no written examinations to pass, and no absolute guarantee that when you have successfully completed your training you will automatically make your way in the profession. It's all a matter of luck plus talent. Yet there is a demand for new faces and new talent, and there is always the prospect of excitement, glamour and the occasional rich reward. 
I have frequently been asked to define this magical thing called talent, which everyone is looking out for. I believe it is best described as natural skill plus imagination - the latter being the most difficult quality to assess. And it has a lot to do with the person's courage and their belief in what they are doing and the way they are putting it across. 
Where does the desire to act come from? It is often very difficult to put into words your own reasons for wanting to act. Certainly, in the theatre the significant thing is that moment of contact between the actor on the stage and a particular audience. And making this brief contact is central to all acting, wherever it takes place - it is what drives all actors to act. 
If you ask actors how they have done well in the profession, the response will most likely be a shrug. They will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job, and that their fame may not continue. 
Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. Last month you may have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly you are asked to audition for a part, but however much you want the job, the truth is that it may be denied you. So actors tend not to talk about their chances. They come up with ways of protecting themselves against the stress of competing for a part and the possibility of rejection. 
Nobody likes being rejected. And remember that the possibility is there from the very first moment you start going in for parts professionally. You are saying that you are available, willing and, hopefully, talented enough for the job. And, in many ways, it's up to you, for if you don't care enough, no-one will care for you. ",B2,"You want to be an actor. People say it is risky. Many people want to be actors, but not many jobs are there. Your friends may say you are crazy. It is your choice. There are no easy tests to pass. You need luck and talent. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. Actors want to connect with the audience. Actors do not know why they are good. They can be famous one day and not the next. Disappointment is a big problem. You may not get a job. Actors protect themselves from stress. No one likes to be told no.

Your close friends might tell you that you are crazy, but it is your personal decision. There are no simple ways to succeed, like passing exams, and training does not guarantee work. Success depends on luck and talent. Talent is a natural ability and imagination, which is hard to measure. Actors are driven by the connection with the audience. When asked how they succeeded, actors often do not know. They understand that fame can be temporary. Disappointment is a major challenge; you might be rejected for roles. Actors find ways to handle the stress of competition. Rejection is possible from the start, and you must show you care to succeed.","If you express a desire to pursue acting as a career, people will quickly describe it as risky, which is accurate due to the high number of actors compared to job opportunities. Friends may react negatively, calling you crazy, but ultimately, it is your personal choice and responsibility to achieve your ambition. There are no straightforward paths, such as written exams, and completing training does not ensure professional success; it relies on a combination of luck and talent. Talent is best defined as innate skill coupled with imagination, the latter being particularly difficult to evaluate, and it involves courage and belief in one's work. The motivation to act often stems from the brief connection between actor and audience, a central aspect of the profession. Successful actors may not fully understand their success, recognizing that their reputation is tied to their current work and can fade. Disappointment is a significant obstacle, as actors face frequent rejections and develop coping strategies to manage the stress of auditions. From the outset, rejection is a possibility, and personal dedication is crucial, as lack of commitment will not attract support.","So you want to be an actor

","Upon declaring an intention to embark upon an acting career, one can anticipate immediate references to its inherent riskiness, a valid concern given the substantial surplus of actors relative to demand. Individuals previously considered close confidants may dismiss your aspirations as irrational, though reactions vary; nevertheless, the decision remains profoundly personal, necessitating sole accountability for the pursuit of one's ambitions. The pathway lacks conventional benchmarks, such as standardized examinations, and even successful training completion offers no assurance of professional advancement, hinging instead on serendipity and innate aptitude. Talent, often described as an amalgamation of natural proficiency and imagination—the latter being notoriously challenging to quantify—is further influenced by an individual's fortitude and conviction in their artistic expression. The impetus to perform frequently derives from the ephemeral yet pivotal interaction between performer and spectators, a universal driver in theatrical endeavors. Inquiries into professional success typically yield equivocal responses, as actors acknowledge the transience of acclaim and their dependency on ongoing engagements. Disappointment poses a formidable adversary, with actors enduring cycles of unemployment and audition rejections, necessitating psychological safeguards against competitive pressures. From the inception of one's professional endeavors, the specter of rejection looms, underscoring the imperative of unwavering dedication, as indifference precludes external endorsement.","When one professes an aspiration to forge a career in acting, it is inevitable that the term 'risky' will be invoked almost instantaneously, an assessment that is unequivocally justified by the pronounced disparity between the oversupply of actors and the limited demand for their services. Those whom one might have regarded as intimate associates may decry such ambitions as folly, albeit with heterogeneous reactions; however, this constitutes an intensely personal抉择, mandating that the individual alone assumes responsibility for the actualization of their vocational objectives. The trajectory eschews facile avenues, such as written evaluations, and even the consummation of rigorous training does not confer an automatic entrée into the profession, being contingent upon a confluence of fortuity and inherent capability. Talent, that elusive attribute sought by all, is most aptly characterized as an innate facility augmented by imagination—the latter representing the most inscrutable element to appraise—and is inextricably linked to the practitioner's audacity and unwavering belief in their methodology and conveyance. The wellspring of the desire to perform often defies articulation, yet in the theatrical realm, the quintessential experience is that transient nexus between the thespian and a specific audience, a phenomenon that underpins all dramaturgical pursuits. Probing actors about their professional efficacy typically elicits noncommittal gestures, as they comprehend the capricious nature of renown and their efficacy being circumscribed by present engagements. Disappointment emerges as the paramount antagonist, with actors frequently oscillating between periods of idleness and the vicissitudes of auditions, thereby devising mechanisms to insulate themselves from the strains of competition and the ever-present potential for repudiation. From the incipience of one's professional forays, the possibility of rejection is omnipresent, and it is incumbent upon the aspirant to demonstrate profound commitment, for apathy will invariably preclude any form of external advocacy."
182,"The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying off to wonderful locations and appearing on the covers of magazines, you'll probably find her revising for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 

'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in an awful mood and refuse to answer my questions. 
But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic and with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. 
Kira gives the impression of being slightly puzzled by her new-found fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should take part in the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. 
The achievement of being selected for the final [line 38: beginning] gave Kira the confidence to go through with it and [line 38: end] she performed perfectly. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. 
Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become accustomed to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I have too high an opinion of myself.' This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.' 
As a busy model though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can ring at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modelling now, you never have time for us"".' 
Kira has the looks, ability and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.' ",B2,"Kira Langer is 15 years old. She is a model. She goes to nice places for work. Her picture is on magazines. She also studies for school exams. A writer, Jane Laidlaw, talks to her. Kira was late for the meeting. The writer thought she might be difficult. But Kira came with her mother. She was nice and friendly. She wore simple clothes. Kira did not plan to be a model. Her sister sent her photos to a competition. Kira won. Now she works with a model agency in London. Kira has two lives: school and modeling. Her friends are proud. But some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks she is too good. Kira says she is the same person, but more confident. Her job affects her social life. She cannot always make plans with friends. Kira is beautiful and successful. The writer asks what job she would do if she was not a model. Kira says she would like to be a writer.","Kira Langer is a 15-year-old schoolgirl and model. When she is not traveling to beautiful places or appearing on magazine covers, she studies for her exams. Jane Laidlaw interviewed her. At first, Jane thought Kira might be late and difficult, as some models are. But Kira arrived with her mother, smiling and sorry for being late. She wore a simple black dress and trainers, not expensive clothes. Kira is friendly and not selfish. Her mother always goes with her to work because she is under 16. Kira became famous by accident. Her sister entered her in a model competition without asking. Kira won and started working with Select model agency in London. Now, Kira manages school and modeling. Her friends and teachers are proud, but some schoolmates are rude about her success. Kira says she has not changed, only become more confident. Her modeling job means she cannot always make plans with friends, but they understand. Kira has the looks and support for a great career. When asked what she would do if not a model, she said she would like to be a writer like Jane.","Kira Langer, aged 15, balances her life as a schoolgirl and a successful model. When not flying to exotic locations or featuring on magazine covers, she focuses on revising for her exams. Jane Laidlaw met her for an interview. Initially, Jane worried that Kira might be late and exhibit the negative traits often associated with models, such as being difficult or vain. However, Kira arrived promptly with her mother, appearing relaxed and apologetic. She was dressed modestly in a black dress and trainers, and her friendly demeanor dispelled any concerns. As required for models under 16, her mother accompanies her to work. Kira's fame was unexpected; her sister submitted her photos to a competition without her consent, leading to her victory and a contract with Select model agency. Juggling school and modeling is challenging, and while most people are supportive, some peers make unkind remarks. Kira handles this by emphasizing that she remains unchanged, only more self-assured. Her social life is affected as she cannot commit to plans due to last-minute modeling jobs, but her friends are understanding. With her talent and backing, Kira has a promising future. When questioned about an alternative career without her modeling success, she expressed interest in journalism.","The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying off to wonderful locations and appearing on the covers of magazines, you'll probably find her revising for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 

'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in an awful mood and refuse to answer my questions. 
But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic and with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. 
Kira gives the impression of being slightly puzzled by her new-found fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should take part in the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. 
The achievement of being selected for the final [line 38: beginning] gave Kira the confidence to go through with it and [line 38: end] she performed perfectly. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. 
Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become accustomed to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I have too high an opinion of myself.' This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.' 
As a busy model though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can ring at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modelling now, you never have time for us"".' 
Kira has the looks, ability and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.' ","Kira Langer, a 15-year-old scholar, adeptly manages her dual roles as an international model and a student preparing for examinations. In the absence of her professional commitments, which involve traveling to picturesque destinations and gracing magazine covers, she dedicates time to academic revision. Journalist Jane Laidlaw conducted an interview with her, initially harboring apprehensions that Kira might embody the stereotypical model attributes of being tardy, vain, or uncooperative. Contrary to these expectations, Kira arrived accompanied by her mother, exuding a composed and apologetic manner, attired in understated garments rather than haute couture. Her amiable and unpretentious nature was immediately evident. Regulatory stipulations mandate that models under 16 be chaperoned by an adult, and her mother, though youthful in appearance, fulfilled this role with evident pride. Kira's ascent to prominence was fortuitous; her elder sister surreptitiously entered her into a modeling contest, culminating in her selection as a finalist and subsequent triumph, which bolstered her confidence and secured her a position with the Select model agency in London. Navigating the dichotomy of her academic and modeling pursuits presents considerable challenges, with most acquaintances expressing admiration, though a minority of school peers derogate her achievements. Kira contends that her core identity remains intact, with only an enhanced self-assurance enabling her to assert herself more effectively. The unpredictability of her modeling schedule impinges upon her social engagements, precluding firm commitments, yet her circle of friends exhibits remarkable tolerance. Endowed with exceptional beauty and robust support, Kira's career prospects are exceedingly bright. Upon inquiry into alternative vocational paths absent her modeling success, she professed an aspiration to pursue a career in journalism.","Kira Langer, a quintessential example of adolescent versatility, seamlessly oscillates between her scholastic responsibilities and a burgeoning modeling career that transports her to idyllic locales and onto the covers of prestigious publications. During interludes from her professional endeavors, she immerses herself in preparatory studies for her academic evaluations. The journalist Jane Laidlaw, in pursuit of an interview, initially entertained preconceived notions that Kira might epitomize the pejorative stereotypes often ascribed to models—capricious, egotistical, or intellectually deficient—particularly when apprised of her delayed arrival. However, Kira materialized in the company of her mother, radiating equanimity and offering apologies, her attire eschewing ostentatious designer wear in favor of a minimalist black dress and trainers. Her disposition was unequivocally congenial and devoid of any hubris. In adherence to statutory requirements for juvenile models, her mother serves as a constant chaperone, and despite her youthful visage, she embodies the archetypal proud parent. Kira's serendipitous rise to eminence was precipitated by her sister's unilateral decision to submit her photographs to a modeling competition, an act that culminated in her being anointed a finalist and, ultimately, the victor, an achievement that galvanized her self-assurance and precipitated an affiliation with London's Select model agency. The exigencies of reconciling her dual existences are formidable, with the majority of her academic milieu expressing approbation, though a contingent of malevolent peers engages in disparaging commentary regarding her accomplishments. Kira articulates that her fundamental character remains unaltered, with the sole augmentation being a refined confidence that empowers her to advocate for herself more assertively. The capricious nature of her modeling assignments invariably disrupts her social calendar, rendering long-term plans untenable, yet her associates demonstrate commendable forbearance. Possessing superlative aesthetics and an unwavering support system, Kira's trajectory toward professional eminence is virtually assured. In a concluding query regarding alternative vocational pursuits in the absence of her modeling prowess, she avowed an inclination toward the field of journalism."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. 

Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean we can't stand up or move and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.' 
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. No-one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures; including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. 
The Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' 
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"". This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.'
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a SO-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. 
There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever before seen them.

Utilizing a constrained steel submersible, she descends to depths of three kilometres to scrutinize hydrothermal vents, colloquially known as 'black smokers', which eject superheated, mineral-rich fluids resembling smoke. These protracted dives, lasting up to 16 hours, entail meticulous sample collection in claustrophobic conditions, with contingency measures including a panic-activated escape module for emergency surfacing. Rachel's six dives encompass collaborations, such as with a Russian crew deploying apparatus for a multinational volcanic drilling initiative. An alarming explosion during an American-led dive precipitated acute apprehension, though the crew emerged unscathed. For Rachel, beholding these abyssal phenomena firsthand instills a profound awe, culminating years of doctoral research into tangible, breathtaking reality."

If there's one thing guaranteed to send tears running down your cheeks, it's the sight of a brilliant child collecting a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars, and their mothers, to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. 

A. 
Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. Her ambitions are to become a physiotherapist and compete at the next Olympics. 'The work is very hard at the moment. There is no time to watch television, or go out with friends or do much more than gym and school.

'From an early age Annika showed tremendous potential. I've seen some parents try to push their children and it doesn't work. To perform at the level Annika does is so demanding of time and energy you have to want to do it yourself. People tell me all the time that we, as parents, have given up so much, but what they don't see is what the sport's given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before she did gym she was a very shy little girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me, but now she's met people from all over the world and she's got the confidence of success.'

Annika Reeder, a 15-year-old gymnast, triumphed with a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games and harbors ambitions of becoming a physiotherapist while aiming for Olympic competition. Her regimen is intensely rigorous, permitting scant leisure for television or social engagements; she adopts a day-by-day approach to training, occasionally receiving reprieves from her coach when fatigued, yet predominantly persevering to circumvent physical stiffness. Annika's mother reflects on her daughter's early demonstration of tremendous potential, critiquing parental coercion as counterproductive and underscoring that such high-level performance necessitates intrinsic motivation. Though observers often remark on familial sacrifices, the mother accentuates the reciprocal benefits—the sport has fostered Annika's evolution from a reticent, thumb-sucking child into a self-assured individual with international acquaintances. Sarah Stokes initiated her show-jumping career at ten, subsequently clinching the British National Championship. She acknowledges the fortuity of her parents' affinity for the sport, as they provide training and logistical support via their horse box. The events, spanning one to five days, perpetually engage her due to their excitement and her unwavering determination; she asserts her autonomy, stating she would persist even sans parental involvement, driven by objectives such as qualifying for the British under-18 team and ultimately securing an Olympic gold medal. Sarah's mother recounts Sarah's instantaneous passion upon mounting a horse at age one, evidenced by pre-dawn pony exercises at five. To access premier competitions, they traverse England, economizing by residing in the horse box's living quarters. She characterizes Sarah as exceptionally organized and blissful equestrian, deriving profound gratification from witnessing her child excel in a beloved pursuit. Jane McShane, the ten-year-old British Under-14 Chess Champion, relishes the convivial ambiance of tournaments but confesses to a deficit in concentration during play, often diverting her attention rather than engaging in deliberate thought. She consciously eschews hubris by refraining from discussing accolades at school to avert discomfort. Jane's mother narrates Jane's inaugural chess encounter at five, orchestrated by her grandfather; in stark contrast to her own juvenile ennui, Jane exhibited immediate ardor, rapidly assimilating all moves and besting adults by six. She expresses contentment with Jane's victories yet advocates for voluntary pursuit, eschewing any inclination to diminish exceptional aptitude and instead championing the fulfillment of inherent potential.","In an evocative exposition by Julia Gregson, the narrative intricately captures the symbiotic relationship between youthful prodigies and their maternal figures, elucidating the concomitant ecstasies and tribulations. Annika Reeder, aged 15, distinguished herself with a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games, concurrently nurturing aspirations for a career in physiotherapy and Olympic contention. Her existence is characterized by an unrelenting training schedule that precludes mundane diversions such as television viewing or social interactions; she navigates her regimen incrementally, with intermittent respites granted by her coach during episodes of profound fatigue, though she predominantly forges ahead to forestall the onset of muscular rigidity. Annika's mother proffers insights into her daughter's nascent exhibition of prodigious talent, disparaging external parental imposition as ineffectual and emphasizing that zenith performance mandates autotelic drive. While external perceptions often focus on familial renunciations, the mother highlights the dialectical gains—the metamorphosis of Annika from a diffident, thumb-sucking youngster into a poised individual with a global network, attributing this transformation to the sport's formative influence. Sarah Stokes embarked on her show-jumping odyssey at ten, subsequently attaining the British National Championship. She recognizes the serendipity of her parents' shared passion, as they furnish both tutelage and transportation in their equine conveyance. The competitions, varying in duration from singular to quintuple days, perpetually invigorate her owing to their inherent exhilaration and her indomitable resolve; she avows that her pursuit would endure independently, galvanized by ambitions including eligibility for the British young riders cohort and the ultimate acquisition of an Olympic gold medal. Sarah's mother reminisces about Sarah's instantaneous captivation with equestrianism upon initial contact at age one, manifest in matutinal equine exertions by five. To secure entry into elite events, they peregrinate throughout England, practicing frugality by domiciling in the horse box's habitable compartment. She depicts Sarah as meticulously organized and in a state of equine-induced euphoria, deriving ineffable satisfaction from observing her progeny flourish in a cherished domain. Jane McShane, the decennial British Under-14 Chess Champion, savors the genial milieu of tournaments yet admits to a lacuna in focus during matches, frequently engaging in peripheral observation rather than cognitive engagement. She deliberately circumvents any semblance of vainglory by omitting discourse on her triumphs within the scholastic environment to preempt discomfiture. Jane's mother recounts Jane's inaugural foray into chess at five, instigated by her grandfather; in diametric opposition to her own puerile apathy, Jane demonstrated immediate fascination, achieving mnemonic mastery of all maneuvers by that afternoon and commencing victories over adults by six. She conveys approbation for Jane's successes while espousing non-interference, repudiating any propensity to stifle extraordinary endowments and instead advocating for the actualization of latent capabilities."
185,"Going up the wall

Once climbers went to the mountains. Now a challenging climb can be had anywhere, indoors or out. 

The crowd holds its breath. High above them on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by the tips of two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. 
The National Indoor Arena is more famous for staging the TV show Gladiators, but the television programme and the World Cup Climbing Championships share at least one feature - The Wall. And the fact that either event is possible is the result of a new and rapidly developing technology. 
Until the mid-1960s,climbers practised their skills on cliffs in areas where there was a plentiful supply of good climbing angles. During the winter they would either tolerate the cold weather, go walking instead or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. 
However, as the sport developed it was increasingly important for top climbers to keep fit. With the cliffs unusable for much of the year, they used brick-edges or stone buildings to 'work out' on. This allowed them to keep their fingers strong, and beat off the boredom of not being able to climb. It wasn't long before many sports centres started building walls specifically for the task, using bricks with special edges to cling on to.
Many of these early walls followed the example set by Don Robinson, a teacher of physical education who, during the mid-1960s,constructed a climbing wall in a corridor of his department at Leeds University. Robinson developed the idea of setting natural rock in a block of concrete, which could then be included in a wall. 
Scores of climbing walls of this kind were built in sports halls up and down the country throughout the 1970s but they had obvious design problems. Walls could only be built in a vertical plane, whereas cliffs outside have features like overhangs and angled slabs of rock. There was the added drawback that once the walls were up they couldn't be altered and climbers would eventually tire of their repetitive nature, despite thinking of every combination of holds possible. 
In 1985,a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, developed a material which he moulded into shapes like those that climbers would find on the cliffs. These could be fixed onto any existing wall and then taken off when climbers got bored with a particular combination. 
French manufacturers also began to experiment with panels on a steel framework. Concrete had proved too heavy to create overhanging walls without major building work, but steel frames could be erected anywhere as free-standing structures. A system of interchangeable fixtures gave climbers an endless supply of new holds. ",B2,"Climbers go up walls. Before, they went to mountains. Now, they can climb inside or outside. People watch. A French climber, Francois Lombard, is high on a wall. He is in a competition in Birmingham. The place is famous for a TV show called Gladiators. Both use a wall. New technology makes this possible. Long ago, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, it was cold, so they walked or climbed on ice in Scotland. Climbers needed to stay strong. They used buildings to climb on. This made their fingers strong and stopped boredom. Soon, sports centers built special walls with bricks to hold. A teacher, Don Robinson, made a wall at Leeds University in the 1960s. He put real rock in concrete. Many walls like this were built in the 1970s. But these walls were only straight up. Real cliffs have slopes and overhangs. Also, the walls could not change, so climbers got bored. In 1985, a Frenchman, Francois Savigny, made new shapes from a material. These shapes could be put on walls and taken off. French companies made panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for slanted walls, but steel frames could stand alone. Climbers could change the holds, so there were always new ways to climb.","Climbers used to go to mountains, but now they can climb anywhere, indoors or outdoors. In a competition, people watch as French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down on a climbing wall in Birmingham. This arena is known for the TV show Gladiators, and both events use a wall made possible by new technology. In the past, climbers practiced on cliffs with good angles. During winter, they dealt with the cold, went walking, or climbed on ice in Scotland. As climbing grew, top climbers needed to stay fit. When cliffs were not usable, they climbed on brick edges or stone buildings to keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom. Sports centers then built special walls with bricks for climbing. Don Robinson, a teacher, created one of the first walls at Leeds University in the 1960s by setting natural rock in concrete. Many such walls were built in the 1970s, but they had problems: they were only vertical, unlike real cliffs with overhangs and slopes, and they could not be changed, so climbers got tired of them. In 1985, Francois Savigny from France developed a material shaped like cliff holds that could be attached and removed from walls. French manufacturers also made panels on steel frames, which were lighter than concrete and allowed for overhanging walls that could be adjusted with new holds.","Originally, climbers ventured into mountains, but nowadays challenging climbs are accessible both indoors and outdoors. At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, spectators watch intently as French climber Francois Lombard dangles upside down high on the climbing wall. This venue is more renowned for hosting the TV program Gladiators, yet both events share the use of The Wall, enabled by advancing technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers honed their skills on natural cliffs with ample climbing angles, and in winter, they either endured the cold, opted for walking, or engaged in snow and ice climbing in Scotland. As the sport evolved, maintaining fitness became crucial for elite climbers. When cliffs were inaccessible, they utilized brick edges or stone structures for training to strengthen their fingers and combat monotony. Consequently, many sports centers began constructing dedicated climbing walls with specially edged bricks. A key influence was Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the mid-1960s by embedding natural rock in concrete. Numerous walls of this type were erected across the country in the 1970s, but they had limitations: they were exclusively vertical, lacking features like overhangs and angled slabs found on real cliffs, and their static design led to repetitiveness that bored climbers over time. In 1985, French inventor Francois Savigny developed a mouldable material that mimicked cliff holds, allowing for removable attachments on walls. Additionally, French manufacturers experimented with steel-framed panels, overcoming the weight issues of concrete and enabling freestanding, adjustable structures with interchangeable fixtures for endless climbing variations.","Going up the wall

","Whereas climbers historically ascended mountains, contemporary practitioners can undertake demanding ascents in diverse settings, whether indoor or outdoor. At the World Cup Climbing Championships held in Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, the audience observes with bated breath as the French athlete Francois Lombard suspends himself inverted, relying solely on his fingertips high upon the climbing wall. Although this arena is predominantly associated with the television spectacle Gladiators, both productions feature The Wall, a manifestation of rapidly evolving technological innovations. Prior to the mid-1960s, climbers refined their techniques on cliffs replete with optimal angles, and during winter months, they either braved inclement conditions, diverted to hiking, or pursued snow and ice ascents in Scotland. With the sport's progression, it became imperative for top-tier climbers to sustain physical conditioning; consequently, when natural rock faces were untenable, they resorted to brick ledges or edifices for training regimens that fortified finger strength and alleviated the ennui of climbing deprivation. This practice precipitated the construction of purpose-built walls in sports centers, incorporating bricks with specialized edges for gripping. A seminal development occurred in the mid-1960s when Don Robinson, a physical education instructor, engineered a climbing wall within his department at Leeds University by integrating natural rock into concrete blocks. Throughout the 1970s, scores of such walls proliferated in sports facilities nationwide, yet they suffered from inherent design flaws: confined to vertical orientations without the overhangs and inclined slabs characteristic of external crags, and their immutable nature eventually induced fatigue among climbers despite exhaustive permutations of holds. In 1985, the French innovator Francois Savigny devised a pliable material fashioned into configurations reminiscent of cliff protrusions, which could be affixed to extant walls and reconfigured at will. Concurrently, French manufacturers pioneered panels mounted on steel frameworks, circumventing the heft of concrete that precluded overhanging constructions without extensive structural modifications, thereby facilitating freestanding assemblies with interchangeable fixtures that afforded an inexhaustible array of novel climbing challenges.","Historically, mountaineering was the domain of climbers, yet in the modern era, arduous ascents are attainable in a multitude of environments, both interior and exterior. During the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, spectators collectively hold their breath as the French climber Francois Lombard, suspended inverted at a considerable height, clings precariously by the tips of two fingers. This venue is more widely recognized for staging the television program Gladiators; however, the two events converge on the utilization of The Wall, a phenomenon made feasible by cutting-edge, swiftly advancing technology. In epochs predating the mid-1960s, alpinists cultivated their prowess on escarpments abundant with favorable climbing facets, and throughout the winter, they either tolerated frigid climes, diverted to pedestrian excursions, or engaged in glaciated and icy pursuits in Scotland. As the discipline matured, it grew increasingly paramount for elite climbers to maintain peak physical condition; ergo, during periods when crags were impracticable, they employed brick cornices or lithic structures for conditioning, thereby preserving digital fortitude and mitigating the tedium induced by climbing abstinence. This exigency soon prompted the erection of dedicated climbing walls in sports centers, featuring bricks endowed with specialized edges for adherence. A pivotal antecedent was established by Don Robinson, a pedagogue in physical education, who, in the mid-1960s, constructed a climbing wall within a corridor of his academic department at Leeds University, pioneering the concept of embedding indigenous rock within concrete matrices for incorporation into walls. Myriads of such edifices were instituted in sports halls across the nation during the 1970s, yet they were plagued by conspicuous design deficiencies: restricted to vertical planes, devoid of the overhangs and angled slabs endemic to natural cliffs, and their immutable configurations eventually engendered climber ennui, notwithstanding exhaustive contemplations of every conceivable hold combination. In 1985, the French visionary Francois Savigny formulated a malleable substance that he sculpted into forms analogous to those encountered on cliffs, which could be affixed to pre-existing walls and subsequently removed to obviate monotony. Simultaneously, French industrialists commenced experimentation with panels affixed to steel frameworks; concrete had proven excessively ponderous for fabricating overhanging walls sans substantial construction, whereas steel frames could be assembled as autonomous structures in any locale. A system of interchangeable fixtures endowed climbers with a perpetual succession of novel handholds, thereby revolutionizing indoor climbing dynamics."
186,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees from the woods were turned into boards for construction work, there was an old brick building two floors high, and all around the outside walls were heaped great piles of soft sawdust. There were many of these golden mountains of dust covering that part of the yard right down to the blue lake. That afternoon, bored with having nothing else to do, all the fellows followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building and they sat with their legs hanging over the edge looking out across the lake. Suddenly Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and without thinking about it, he pushed himself off the roof and fell on the sawdust where he lay rolling around and laughing. 'I dare you all!' he shouted. 'You're all cowards,' he said, encouraging them to follow him. Still laughing, he watched them looking down from the roof, white-faced and hesitant, and then one by one they jumped and got up grinning with relief. 
In the hot afternoon sunlight they all lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes till at last one of the fellows said, 'Come on up on the old roof again and jump down.'There wasn't much enthusiasm among them, but they all went up to the roof again and began to jump off in a determimed desperate way till only Michael was left and the others were all down below grinning up at him calling, 'Come on, Mike. What's the matter with you?' Michael wanted to jump down there and be with them, but he remained on the edge of the roof, wetting his lips, with a silly grin on his face, wondering why it had not seemed such a long drop the first time. For a while they thought he was only fooling them, but then they saw him clenching his fists tight. He was trying to count to ten and then jump, and when that failed, he tried to take a long breath and close his eyes. In a while the fellows began to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting and it was getting on to dinnertime. 'Come on, you're a coward, do you think we're going to sit here all night?' they began to shout, and when he did not move they began to get up and walk away, still shouting. 'Who did this in the first place? What's the matter with you all?' he called. 
But for a long time he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily and steadily at the ground. He remained all alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a great orange ball getting bigger and bigger, rolled slowly over the grey line beyond the lake. His clothes , were wet from nervous sweating. At last he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the pile of sawdust and lay there a long time. There were no sounds in the yard, the workmen had gone home. As he lay there he wondered why he had been unable to jump and then he got up slowly and walked home feeling deeply ashamed and wanting to avoid everybody. 
He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said to him coldly, 'You're big enough by this time surely to be able to get home in time for dinner. But if you won't come home, you'd better try staying in tonight.' She was a well-built woman with a fair, soft skin and a little touch of grey in her hair and an eternally patient smile on her face. She was speaking now with a controlled severity, but Michael, with his dark face gloomy and miserable, hardly heard her; he was still seeing the row of grinning faces down below on the sawdust pile and hearing them laugh at him. ",B2,"There is a place by a lake. Trees are made into wood there. There is an old building. There is a lot of soft sawdust outside. The boys are with Michael. They go up to the roof.

Hesitantly, they all jumped and felt relieved. Later, they returned to the roof to jump again, but this time Michael was left alone, unable to jump despite his earlier bravery. He felt frightened and unsure, while the others grew impatient, laughed at him, and eventually left. After nearly an hour, Michael jumped down, went home late, and was scolded by his stepmother.

","Adjacent to the lake, within the lumberyard where timber was milled into construction boards, an antiquated two-story brick edifice was enveloped by substantial mounds of pliant sawdust. That afternoon, ennui prompted the group of boys to ascend with Michael to the rooftop, from which he precipitously leaped onto the sawdust, issuing a dare for the others to emulate his act. Initially apprehensive, they successively jumped, experiencing palpable relief. Upon returning to repeat the endeavor, however, Michael found himself paralyzed with trepidation on the roof's edge, while his companions, growing restive, derided him before departing. Left in solitude as dusk approached, Michael eventually descended, returning home to face his stepmother's reproachful admonishment. He was consumed by mortification, haunted by the visages of his peers' ridicule.","In the lakeside lumberyard, where arboreal resources were transformed into utilitarian lumber, a dilapidated two-story brick structure was circumscribed by colossal accumulations of supple sawdust. That afternoon, beset by ennui, the coterie of youths accompanied Michael to the rooftop, whence he capriciously propelled himself onto the sawdust, exhorting the others with taunts of cowardice to follow suit. They complied with trepidation, albeit with subsequent gratification. In a subsequent iteration of the leap, Michael alone remained on the precipice, immobilized by a sudden, inexplicable dread, while his comrades, their patience exhausted, subjected him to derision before absconding. Lingering in protracted isolation as the sun descended, he ultimately effected his descent, returning belatedly to incur his stepmother's censure. Profoundly chagrined, he was incessantly tormented by the spectral mockery of his erstwhile companions."

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. 

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. 
Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' 
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. 
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. 
Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' 
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. 
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' 
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says. ",B2,Sarah works in France. She is a chalet girl. She cooks and cleans for people on holiday. They come to ski. She makes breakfast and dinner. She cleans the rooms. She also skis. She works hard.

She prepares meals and cleans for guests staying in chalets to ski. Her day starts early with breakfast, then cleaning or making tea, followed by skiing. She returns to cook dinner and sometimes socializes with guests. She goes out with friends but avoids late nights before Sundays, which are hectic with guest turnover and cleaning. She finds the job enjoyable for meeting people before settling into a career.","Keeping the holiday-makers happy

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. 
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' 
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.

Giving directions to an orchestra is never easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work. 

A. ANNE MANSON 

When Anne Manson, 30, asked if she could attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna, she found herself standing in for an absent assistant. She was then asked to help on another opera the next season. 'I had to take the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I always had a good attitude to standing up in front of an orchestra.' American-born Manson works with a well established London-based opera company which concentrates on modern works. She is also building a reputation in other European countries, which she has visited with financial aid from the British Arts Council, and, since that first occasion, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects. 

B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE 

The most difficult part of being a conductor is deciding how to convince people to present you with the right opportunities; saysAndrew Constantine, 31, who won a major competition in 1991, after failed attempts in two other contests. Looking back, he is grateful for the timing: 'If it had happened any earlier, I am sure I would have disappeared without trace: The competition provided many performance opportunities and a period as assistant to a well-known conductor, but Constantine is finding it difficult to lose the 'competition' label: 'If in three years' time my name is still associated with the competition then I will be worried,' he says.'But orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra who took me on after the competition are now inviting me back. If this doesn't happen,your career will gradually fall to pieces.' 

C. WASFI KANI 

Wasfi Kani, who set up Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice period which is part of any opera production. 'The music is worth four weeks' attention; says Kani, who started conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she supported herself by working in London's commercial centre until Pimlico Opera turned fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons 
with Sian Edwards was the key moment for her. 'I saw her conduct and realised she was the same size as me - I had always been taught by much bigger people which makes a huge difference.' She likes the complicated nature of opera: 'There are lots of arguments, and you've got singers' personalities to consider ... ' 

D. ROGER VIGNOLES 

'Conducting has come upon me as something of a surprise, but it holds great fascination for me,' says Roger Vignoles, 48. In fact, it's not such a strange career move. He started out as a resident musician with an opera house, and worked with good conductors. Last year he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. 'It was much less difficult than I thought. I found I knew the music well, I knew what I wanted it to sound like, and I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. Fortunately, people have respected my ability as a musician generally. I am benefiting from every piece of experience I've ever had, both in musical style and in the actual business of performing. Now I will do whatever people ask me to do so I can find out what I like doing.' 

E. WAYNE MARSHALL 

It was back in 1986 that the conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor on one of his productions and told his agent about Wayne Marshall. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, a difficult beginning. He even had to deal with some over-relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: 'I was just tough with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. A lot of orchestral musicians I've seen don't seem to need advice and instruction from a conductor. But I'm never afraid to say what I want. If people see you're worried, it gets worse. I've never studied conducting formally and no book tells you how to conduct but people have been kind to me. I am determined and I know what I like.'

","The text presents insights from five emerging conductors on their professional journeys. A. Anne Manson, a 30-year-old American, initially attended Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna and was subsequently appointed to stand in for an absent assistant, later assisting on additional operas. She confidently undertook her first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado, underscoring her composed demeanor in front of orchestras. Currently, she collaborates with a prestigious London-based opera company specializing in contemporary works and is cultivating her reputation across Europe, aided by funding from the British Arts Council, while continuing to assist Abbado on various projects. B. Andrew Constantine, aged 31, reflects that the most challenging aspect of conducting is securing appropriate opportunities; he triumphed in a major 1991 competition after earlier disappointments. He expresses gratitude for the timing, believing an earlier victory might have led to obscurity. Although the competition afforded performance opportunities and an assistantship with a renowned conductor, he finds it arduous to shed the 'competition' association. He remarks that orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra, which engaged him post-competition, are now reinviting him, a vital factor in preventing career deterioration. C. Wasfi Kani, founder of Pimlico Opera, values the protracted rehearsal periods inherent in opera productions, asserting that the music warrants such dedication. She commenced serious conducting in her late twenties and sustained herself through work in London's financial district until the opera became fully professional two years prior. A pivotal moment was commencing lessons with Sian Edwards, whose similar stature contrasted with her previous instructors, significantly influencing her approach. She relishes the intricate dynamics of opera, including conflicts and the management of diverse singer personalities. D. Roger Vignoles, 48, describes his foray into conducting as an unexpected yet deeply engaging development. With a background as a resident musician in an opera house, where he collaborated with esteemed conductors, he was invited last year to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano—a novel experience that proved less daunting than anticipated. He leveraged his thorough familiarity with the music and clear artistic vision, earning respect for his overall musicianship. He emphasizes that his cumulative experiences in musical style and performance inform his current work, and he remains open to diverse engagements to ascertain his preferences. E. Wayne Marshall, now 32, was identified by Simon Rattle in 1986, leading to an impromptu conducting role in a London musical—a demanding initiation. He confronted instances of professional musicians' laxity, such as reading newspapers during performances, and addressed them with assertiveness and precise direction. Marshall observes that many orchestral musicians may not require extensive guidance, but he never hesitates to articulate his demands, avoiding any display of apprehension. Despite lacking formal conducting education, he attributes his progress to others' benevolence, coupled with his resolute determination and clear artistic convictions.","The text elucidates the professional trajectories of five nascent conductors, each offering nuanced perspectives on their vocations. A. Anne Manson, a 30-year-old American, fortuitously transitioned from observing Claudio Abbado's rehearsals in Vienna to substituting for an absent assistant, subsequently being enlisted for further operatic endeavors the following season. She undertook her inaugural orchestral rehearsal for Abbado with equanimity, attributing her composure to a innate confidence in orchestrating ensembles. Presently, she is affiliated with a venerable London-based opera company that emphasizes modern repertoire and is augmenting her renown throughout Europe, facilitated by subsidies from the British Arts Council, while persisting in her collaborations with Abbado on assorted initiatives. B. Andrew Constantine, aged 31, posits that the paramount difficulty in conducting lies in orchestrating circumstances that yield propitious opportunities; he secured a seminal victory in a 1991 competition after antecedent failures in other contests. Retrospectively, he appreciates the serendipitous timing, conjecturing that a premature triumph might have precipitated his obscurity. Although the competition engendered numerous performance prospects and a tenure as assistant to an eminent conductor, he grapples with the persistent 'competition' epithet. He avers that if this association endures beyond three years, it would be disquieting, yet notes that ensembles like the English Chamber Orchestra, which initially engaged him post-competition, are now extending return invitations—a critical determinant in averting career fragmentation. C. Wasfi Kani, the founder of Pimlico Opera, extols the extensive rehearsal durations integral to opera productions, contending that the musical complexity justifies such protracted attention. She embarked on earnest conducting in her late twenties and sustained herself via employment in London's commercial epicenter until the opera achieved full professional status two years ago. A seminal juncture was initiating tutelage under Sian Edwards, whose commensurate physical stature contrasted with her prior instructors, effecting a profound pedagogical impact. She derives satisfaction from the multifarious nature of opera, encompassing disputations and the necessity to accommodate singers' idiosyncrasies. D. Roger Vignoles, 48, characterizes his incursion into conducting as an unanticipated yet profoundly captivating evolution. Originating as a resident musician within an opera house, where he interfaced with accomplished conductors, he was solicited last year to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival—an unprecedented undertaking that he found less arduous than envisaged. He discovered that his profound assimilation of the music and lucid sonic aspirations enabled him to elicit the desired performance, with his overarching musicianship garnering esteem. He benefits holistically from his cumulative experiences in musical aesthetics and practical execution, and he proactively seeks diverse commissions to delineate his proclivities. E. Wayne Marshall, presently 32, was discerned by Simon Rattle in 1986 when serving as an assistant conductor, prompting Rattle to notify his agent; Marshall shortly thereafter assumed direction of a London musical on abbreviated notice, an exigent commencement. He encountered scenarios of professional musicians' nonchalance, such as perusing periodicals during performances, and countered with resoluteness and unequivocal beats, optimizing outcomes. He notes that many orchestral musicians may not necessitate extensive conductions, yet he remains unabashed in articulating his exigencies, eschewing any manifestation of trepidation to preclude exacerbation. Despite an absence of formal pedagogical training in conducting, he ascribes his advancement to others' magnanimity, fortified by his indomitable determination and unequivocal artistic predilections."

","Persistently, British tabloid newspapers disseminate imagery that encroaches upon personal privacy and contravenes the editors' code of practice. Although pop stars may occasionally engage with paparazzi, it is more customary for individuals in the public eye to experience significant detriment upon seeing their most intimate moments featured on front pages. Despite this, recourse to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an entity instituted to adjudicate such infringements, is infrequently pursued. These pictorial intrusions are rarely justified by public interest; for example, neither clandestine photographs of pop stars nor images of a renowned actress on a hotel balcony—a locale where privacy is reasonably anticipated—serve to uncover criminal activity or safeguard public welfare. The PCC's failure to autonomously launch inquiries, such as into an egregious report concerning a pop star's romantic affairs, is reprehensible. Were the PCC to adopt a proactive stance, it could precipitate numerous adverse judgments against publications, potentially curbing such practices through media exposure and public disapprobation. Nevertheless, formidable obstacles exist, including the delineation of inquiry thresholds, the potential for exacerbating victims' humiliation, and the Herculean task of surveilling the entirety of the British press. Moreover, celebrities might abstain from complaints to avoid further scrutiny or retaliatory narratives, as exemplified by a comedian who feared derisive coverage. This conundrum presents no straightforward resolution.","With relentless frequency, British tabloid newspapers propagate visuals that constitute an invasion of privacy and flout the editorial code of conduct. While it is true that pop stars might on occasion willingly pose for paparazzi, the norm entails profound injury to public figures whose private instants are illicitly captured and sensationalized. Astonishingly, there is a paucity of appeals to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), the body constituted to redress such grievances. These depictions are almost invariably devoid of public interest justification; intimate snapshots of celebrities neither facilitate crime detection nor contribute to public health and safety, as evidenced by the case of a distinguished actress photographed on a hotel balcony—an environment where a reasonable expectation of privacy prevails. The PCC's inertia in instigating independent investigations, including into an outrageous exposé of a pop star's amorous life, is nothing short of scandalous. Should the PCC embrace a quasi-policing function, it could engender a cascade of condemnatory rulings, disseminated by rival outlets and eliciting public censure, thereby compelling editors to eschew such material. However, this approach is fraught with complexities: determining the impetus for inquiries, navigating victims' potential reluctance due to mortification, and the Sisyphean endeavor of monitoring the entire British press landscape. Furthermore, celebrities may opt for silence to circumvent additional embarrassment or the risk of unleashing more damning narratives, a trepidation poignantly illustrated by a comedian who refrained from complaint to preempt mockery. This intricate dilemma defies facile solutions."

Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had only just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact, nobody to tell you that their bedsit would be vacant at the end of the month. No, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching.
For Jo, Dublin was a very big blank spot. She really felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go. Who would stay in a one-horse town, the back of beyond, the end of the world, the sticks? That's all she had heard for years. They were all going to get out, escape, see some life, get some living in, have a real kind of existence, and some of the others in her class had gone as far as the towns of Ennis or Limerick, where an elder sister or an aunt would see them settled in. But out of Jo's year, none of them were going to Dublin. She was heading off on her own.
Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel. It was run by nuns, and she would come to no harm. Her father said that he hoped they kept the place warm; hostels were well known for being freezing. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel as waitresses, said she must be off her head to have stayed a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking about her and discussing her, as she answered the advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too dear!
There wasn't a queue for this one because it wasn't so much 'Flat to Let', more 'Third Girl Wanted'. The fact that it said 'own television' made Jo wonder whether it might be too high a class for her, but the house did not look in any way overpowering. An ordinary red-brick terraced house with a basement. But the flat was not in the basement, it was upstairs. And a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and went on climbing.
'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' printed on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that toffee-nosed girl going out? I can't stand that kind, I can't stand them.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just poked around and pulled a face and sort of giggled and then said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her in here, would we, Pauline?'
Pauline had a psychedelic shirt on, so colourful it almost hurt the eyes, but even so it was only slightly brighter than her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with amazement. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I rang.' Nessa said they were just about to have a mug of tea. She produced three mugs; one had 'Nessa' and one had 'Pauline' and the other one had 'Other' written on it. 'We'll get your name put on if you come to stay,' she said generously.",B2,"It was very hard to find a cheap flat in Dublin. The best way was to know someone. But Jo was new in Dublin. She did not know anyone. She stayed in a hostel and looked for a flat. Jo felt Dublin was big and new. She did not ask why she went there. Her friends all said they would leave their small town. Some went to other towns. Jo went to Dublin alone. Jo's mother liked the hostel because nuns ran it. Her father said hostels are cold. Her sisters said she was silly to stay in a hostel. Jo did not know they talked about her. She saw an ad for a flat. It had her own room and TV. She shared the kitchen and bathroom. It was near her work. She hoped it was nice and cheap. There was no line for the flat. It needed a third girl. The house was normal. A girl came out and said the place was bad. Jo went in. A girl named Nessa said hello. She did not like the girl who left. Jo asked why. Nessa said the girl was rude. Another girl, Pauline, had bright clothes and hair. Jo saw she was a punk. Jo said she worked at the post office. Nessa gave her tea in a mug that said 'Other'. Nessa said they would put Jo's name on a mug if she stayed.","Finding a cheap flat in Dublin was very difficult. The best method was through personal contacts. But Jo had just arrived in Dublin, so she had no contacts. She had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. Jo felt Dublin was a big, unknown place. She didn't question why she was going there. All her school friends assumed they would leave their small town. Some went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, but Jo was the only one going to Dublin alone. Jo's mother thought the hostel was good because nuns ran it. Her father worried that hostels are often cold. Her sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought Jo was crazy to stay in a hostel. Jo didn't know her family was still discussing her. She answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. It offered her own room and TV, with a shared kitchen and bathroom. It was close to her job at the post office and seemed perfect. She hoped it would be nice and not too expensive. There wasn't a queue because it was for a third girl, not a full flat. Jo worried it might be too fancy, but the house looked ordinary. A girl leaving said it was a terrible place, but Jo went upstairs. Nessa greeted her and complained about the previous girl, calling her snobby. Pauline, who had colorful clothes and punk hair, was there too. Jo introduced herself and her job. Nessa offered tea and said they would personalize a mug for Jo if she moved in.","Finding an affordable flat in Dublin was as challenging as discovering gold during the gold rush. The most effective approach was through personal connections; if you knew someone who was vacating a place, it often worked out. However, Jo had recently arrived in Dublin, so she lacked any such contacts and had to resort to staying in a hostel while searching. For Jo, Dublin represented a vast, unfamiliar territory, and she felt she was stepping into the unknown without questioning her reasons for moving. It was a common expectation among her school peers to leave their provincial town for a more exciting life, with some relocating to places like Ennis or Limerick, but Jo was the sole person from her year heading to Dublin alone. Her mother believed the hostel, run by nuns, was a safe option, her father expressed concerns about the cold, and her sisters, employed as waitresses, thought she was irrational for enduring a week there. Unaware of their ongoing discussions, Jo responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that promised a private room with a TV and shared kitchen and bathroom, conveniently located near her post office job, and she fervently hoped it would be pleasant and affordable. There was no queue for the flat since it was advertised as needing a third girl rather than a full rental. Although Jo feared it might be too upscale due to the mention of a personal TV, the house appeared ordinary. Upon arriving, she encountered a departing girl who disparaged the place, but Jo proceeded upstairs where Nessa welcomed her and criticized the previous applicant for being condescending. Pauline, with her vibrant punk style, was also present, and after Jo introduced herself, Nessa offered tea and assured her that they would customize a mug if she decided to stay.","No Title

Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had only just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact, nobody to tell you that their bedsit would be vacant at the end of the month. No, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching.
For Jo, Dublin was a very big blank spot. She really felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go. Who would stay in a one-horse town, the back of beyond, the end of the world, the sticks? That's all she had heard for years. They were all going to get out, escape, see some life, get some living in, have a real kind of existence, and some of the others in her class had gone as far as the towns of Ennis or Limerick, where an elder sister or an aunt would see them settled in. But out of Jo's year, none of them were going to Dublin. She was heading off on her own.
Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel. It was run by nuns, and she would come to no harm. Her father said that he hoped they kept the place warm; hostels were well known for being freezing. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel as waitresses, said she must be off her head to have stayed a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking about her and discussing her, as she answered the advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too dear!
There wasn't a queue for this one because it wasn't so much 'Flat to Let', more 'Third Girl Wanted'. The fact that it said 'own television' made Jo wonder whether it might be too high a class for her, but the house did not look in any way overpowering.

She produced three mugs; one had 'Nessa' and one had 'Pauline' and the other one had 'Other' written on it. 'We'll get your name put on if you come to stay,' she said generously.","Securing a reasonably priced flat in Dublin was akin to unearthing gold during the frenzied gold rush era, with the most reliable method being personal referrals; if one had an acquaintance who knew of someone departing a residence, it frequently proved successful. Yet, Jo, having only recently arrived in the city, possessed no such network and was compelled to lodge in a hostel whilst conducting her search. Dublin loomed as an immense, enigmatic void for Jo, who embarked on this journey without introspection regarding her motives, as it was an unquestioned assumption among her scholastic cohort that they would forsake their insular, rural town for a more vibrant existence. While some of her contemporaries had migrated to provincial hubs such as Ennis or Limerick, Jo was the solitary individual from her academic year venturing to Dublin independently. Her mother extolled the virtues of the convent-administered hostel as a secure haven, her father voiced apprehensions about the notorious chilliness of such establishments, and her sisters, employed in the hospitality sector, deemed her week-long hostel stay irrational. Oblivious to their persistent deliberations, Jo pursued an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend, which touted exclusive amenities including a personal room and television, alongside shared kitchen and bathroom facilities, and its proximity to her workplace at the post office rendered it seemingly ideal, prompting her to ardently wish for its acceptability and affordability. The absence of a queue was attributable to the listing's focus on acquiring a third female occupant rather than leasing the entire flat. Although the specification of a private television gave Jo pause, suspecting it might exceed her social stratum, the domicile itself was an unassuming red-brick terrace. As she ascended, a disgruntled applicant descending the stairs derided the premises, but Jo persevered and was greeted by Nessa, who expressed disdain for the prior candidate's supercilious demeanor. Pauline, adorned in a psychedelic shirt and punk aesthetic that Jo observed with astonishment, was also present, and following Jo's self-introduction detailing her employment, Nessa proffered tea and magnanimously proposed personalizing a mug should Jo elect to reside with them.","The quest for a habitable flat in Dublin at an attainable cost was comparable to prospecting for gold amidst the tumultuous gold rush, wherein the most efficacious strategy invariably involved personal connections; if one was privy to an individual cognizant of another's imminent vacancy, such insider knowledge often facilitated success. However, Jo, as a recent arrival to the metropolis, was devoid of any such affiliations, necessitating her sojourn in a hostel whilst she scoured for accommodations. For Jo, Dublin constituted a vast terra incognita, and she embarked upon this venture without interrogating her underlying motivations, as it had been an unspoken consensus among her academic associates that egress from their parochial, one-horse town was imperative for procuring a substantive existence. Whilst several of her peers had decamped to urban centers like Ennis or Limerick, Jo was the sole representative from her cohort to undertake the solitary pilgrimage to Dublin. Her mother advocated for the perpetual residence in the nun-operated hostel as a bastion of safety, her father articulated concerns regarding the pervasive frigidity endemic to such institutions, and her sisters, ensconced in waitressing roles, opined that her week-long hostel endurance was indicative of folly. Unbeknownst to Jo, her familial circle continued to ruminate upon her circumstances as she responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend, which promulgated exclusive entitlements to a private chamber with television and communal kitchen and bathroom access, its adjacency to her postal employment rendering it ostensibly propitious, and she supplicated for its congeniality and fiscal moderation. The dearth of a queue was explicable by the advertisement's solicitation for a third female cohabitant rather than a comprehensive lease. Although the allusion to a personal television incited trepidation in Jo that the establishment might be beyond her station, the edifice itself was a conventional red-brick terrace, and upon her ascent, a departing aspirant, adorned in collegiate regalia, disparaged the locale as 'desperate' and 'common as dirt.' Undeterred, Jo proceeded to encounter Nessa, who inveighed against the preceding applicant's patrician affectations, and Pauline, whose punk visage and kaleidoscopic attire Jo regarded with awe. Subsequent to Jo's delineation of her vocational status, Nessa extended hospitality with tea and graciously intimated that they would emblazon a mug with her appellation should she elect to domicile with them."
191,"The Collectors 

Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and the reasons why so many people enjoy the same hobby.
 
I have always loved collecting and collectors and one in three adults indulges in this hobby. It is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm and delight. However, if you enter this world, remember one thing: in the end, if you do not fall in love with an object, do not collect it. 
Since the beginning of time, people have had the urge to collect. When primitive man collected pebbles, he hung them around his neck. Attracted by their shapes and colour, these pebbles represented man's first attempts to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the intervening centuries, nothing much has changed. Small boys and girls still collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. 
I have been collecting all my life. Everything from flowers such as tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was of stones picked up in my parents' garden. Aged six I had the good fortune, although it did not seem so at the time, to be sent to a school in a remote part of England, a cold and windy place surrounded by hills. When my parents came to visit me they used to take me to the local museum, which was full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. 
Surprisingly I am not alone in being interested in collecting objects. One in three adults indulges the same passion. The reasons why people collect has become a subject of great interest. The current thinking is that, for some individuals, it is the only aspect of their lives where they have complete control. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing.
One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a 'room of wonders'. This was a collection of natural and artificial curiosities. There were cups made from coconut shells, carved ivory beads and pieces of Oriental china. Another aristocrat, Catherine the Great of Russia, collected more than 4,000 paintings.
However, you do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. I have collected items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups, searching out examples of each type with incredible determination. I remember the day that I persuaded a fellow collector of tulips to part with one which I wanted to add to my collection. I planted it and watered it until one year it vanished - stolen by another collector. 
One collection that I made was of American rag dolls - 350 of them. I looked all over the USA for these dolls, searching out each variation in design with delight. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. Next morning, I stood inside the front hall and saw the remains of furniture and my collection. I am not certain which saddened me more!
It is, I suppose, the way that collections change hands that has always interested me. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king, a poet: it is this that gives value to the goods that are traded in the markets of the world. As small objects become a popular collector's item, so they begin to rise in price. The toys of the 1950s are now positively an investment, provided of course, that you did not throw away the original boxes. (Not only did I put them in the bin, I also did the same to the contents.)

","In 'The Collectors,' Amanda Roy expounds upon her personal compulsion for collecting and elucidates the motivations behind this widespread hobby, noting that one in three adults indulges in it. This realm is characterized by fervent passion, envy, enthusiasm, and delight; however, she cautions that one should only amass objects for which one develops a genuine affection. From primordial epochs, humanity has exhibited an innate urge to collect, with early humans gathering pebbles, captivated by their forms and hues, and adorning themselves with them as initial endeavors to accumulate items for intellectual and spiritual fulfillment. Over the ensuing centuries, this propensity has persisted largely unaltered, as evidenced by children who continue to collect stones and seashells purely for their aesthetic appeal. Amanda herself has engaged in collecting throughout her lifetime, encompassing a diverse array of items from tulips to pottery and paintings. Her inaugural collection involved stones procured from her parents' garden. At the age of six, she was dispatched to a school in an isolated, inclement region of England, and during parental visits, excursions to the local museum, replete with historical collections, profoundly captivated her. Intriguingly, she is not solitary in this pursuit, as a significant proportion of adults share this passion. The rationale behind collecting has garnered considerable scholarly attention, with contemporary theories positing that for certain individuals, it constitutes the sole domain wherein they exercise absolute control. For Amanda, it is merely an avocation she relishes. Illustrious collectors include the Duc de Berry in France, who maintained a 'chamber of wonders' housing an assemblage of natural and artificial curiosities, such as coconut shell cups, intricately carved ivory beads, and Oriental porcelain. Similarly, Catherine the Great of Russia amassed over 4,000 paintings. Nevertheless, initiating a collection does not necessitate wealth or influence; Amanda has pursued items as disparate as tulip bulbs and china cups, assiduously seeking out exemplars with remarkable tenacity. She recollects persuading a fellow tulip enthusiast to relinquish a specimen, which she cultivated until it was purloined by another collector. Another endeavor involved accumulating 350 American rag dolls, for which she scoured the United States to procure each design variation, only for the collection to be obliterated in a conflagration that consumed her residence, leaving her ambivalent about which loss was more disheartening. Amanda is particularly fascinated by the transference of collections among owners, wherein artifacts like a silver spoon once possessed by monarchs or poets accrue value in global markets. As diminutive objects gain popularity among collectors, their market prices escalate accordingly. Toys from the 1950s have now evolved into viable investments, contingent upon the preservation of their original packaging—a precaution Amanda neglected, having discarded both boxes and contents.","Amanda Roy's treatise, 'The Collectors,' delves into her profound affinity for collecting and the underlying reasons that render this pastime so pervasive, with one in three adults partaking in it. This domain is imbued with intense passion, envy, enthusiasm, and delight; yet, she admonishes that entrants should only cultivate collections of objects for which they develop an authentic ardor. Since time immemorial, humankind has been driven by an intrinsic compulsion to collect, exemplified by primitive humans who gathered pebbles, enthralled by their configurations and chromatic qualities, and suspended them as adornments, representing nascent efforts to assemble items for intellectual and spiritual edification. Over the intervening millennia, this proclivity has remained remarkably consistent, as contemporary youth still amass stones and seashells solely for their formal and chromatic splendor. Amanda has been an inveterate collector throughout her existence, encompassing a panoply of items from tulips to ceramics and artworks. Her initial foray into collecting involved stones gleaned from her parental garden. At the tender age of six, she was consigned to an educational institution in a secluded, austere locale in England, and during familial visits, sojourns to the local museum, which housed an extensive array of historically collected artifacts, profoundly mesmerized her. Astonishingly, she is not an anomaly in this regard, as a substantial segment of the adult population indulges in analogous passions. The etiology of collecting has become a subject of considerable academic intrigue, with prevailing hypotheses suggesting that for some individuals, it represents the exclusive facet of their lives over which they exert complete dominion. For Amanda, it is simply a pursuit she derives pleasure from. Eminent collectors include the Duc de Berry in France, who curated a 'cabinet of curiosities' containing an eclectic assemblage of natural and artificial rarities, such as receptacles fashioned from coconut shells, exquisitely carved ivory beads, and fragments of Oriental porcelain. Similarly, Catherine the Great of Russia assembled a collection exceeding 4,000 paintings. Nonetheless, embarking upon a collection does not presuppose affluence or power; Amanda has assiduously collected disparate items like tulip bulbs and china cups, endeavoring to procure exemplars with indefatigable resolve. She reminisces about cajoling a fellow tulip collector into relinquishing a coveted specimen, which she nurtured until it was expropriated by another enthusiast. Another undertaking involved the accumulation of 350 American rag dolls, for which she traversed the United States to secure each design iteration, only for the collection to be annihilated in a domestic inferno, leaving her uncertain as to which bereavement—the furniture or the collection—occasioned greater despondency. Amanda is particularly captivated by the vicissitudes of collection ownership, wherein artifacts such as a silver spoon once belonging to sovereigns or literary figures acquire enhanced value in international markets. As diminutive objects ascend to the status of coveted collector's items, their economic valuation commensurately escalates. Toys from the 1950s have now metamorphosed into substantively appreciable assets, provided one has retained the original packaging—a precaution Amanda eschewed, having consigned both containers and contents to disposal."
192,"It's a tough job? 

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they're as wonderful as they seem. 

A. Raquel Graham 

Raquel Graham rings from the taxi taking her to the airport. She can't make our appointment tomorrow because her boss wants her to be in Los Angeles instead. When you're personal assistant to a pop star, you're expected to jet around the world at the drop of a hat. Raquel loves her job and gets on well with her boss. 
There's just one minor problem - she can't stand flying. 'On a nine-hour trip to California I usually take sleeping tablets to help calm me down,' she admits. Her worst experience was being on Concorde. 'It seemed so shut in with those tiny windows.' 
Offices in Manchester and London occupy her when she comes down to earth. There's some mundane paperwork to get through - organising the diary, sitting in on meetings with solicitors and accountants, sorting out itineraries and making yet more travel arrangements. 
She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with the manager of a pop group led to the offer of work behind the scenes and she took a secretarial certificate at evening classes at the same time. Five years later she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. 

B. David Brown 

David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy; a man who carries a golfer's bags. On the whole, he preferred the golf. Well, so would you if golf was your passion. There were drawbacks however. A small flat fee is on offer, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between PS25,000 and PS35,000 and much of that will go on travel and hotels. 
He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're offering advice, pitting your knowledge against the elements and trying to read the course.' 
His accountancy skills were recently recognised by European Tour Productions when they made him statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyses the statistics of each day's play. The results are sought after by television commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. 

C. Martin Fern 

Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper and one of his less difficult tasks is to sample what's on offer in the finest restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge exorbitant prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's up to them,' he says. 'I'd rather spend PS120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' 
It was his talent as a cook that led to the offer of a food column from a friend who happened to edit a Saturday Review. For Martin, at the time creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful secondary income. He was 42 when another newspaper rang to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50 per cent cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to convert my passion into a profession.' 
He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. 

D. Dick Prince 

'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I had always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing had mainly been verse. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer, and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. 
So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' 
Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbling - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. 
I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.'

She travels around the world for her job. She does not like flying, so she takes sleeping pills on long flights. Her worst flight was on Concorde because it felt too closed in. When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London, doing paperwork like organizing schedules and meetings. She got the job by chance after meeting a manager, and she took secretarial classes. Five years later, she became the pop star's assistant. B. David Brown: David worked as an accountant and a golf caddy. A caddy carries a golfer's bags and gives advice. He preferred being a caddy because he loves golf, but the pay was not high, with average earnings between £25,000 and £35,000. Now, he works as a statistical data administrator for golf, analyzing scores from caddies. TV commentators, magazines, and golfers use his data. C. Martin Fern: Martin is an editor for a newspaper's food section. He samples food in fine restaurants. He says expensive restaurants are fine for those who can afford them.

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as wonderful as they appear. A. Raquel Graham: Raquel works as a personal assistant to a pop star, requiring her to travel globally at short notice. She enjoys her job and has a good relationship with her boss, but she dislikes flying and often uses sleeping tablets on long flights. Her worst experience was on Concorde due to the confined space. When grounded, she handles routine tasks in Manchester and London offices, such as diary management, attending meetings, and arranging travel. She obtained the job unexpectedly after a chance encounter with a manager, and she enhanced her skills with a secretarial certificate. After five years, she was perfectly positioned to become the PA. B. David Brown: David has experience as an accountant and a golf caddy, where he carried bags and provided advice on golf courses. He favored caddying because of his passion for golf, despite drawbacks like modest earnings of £25,000 to £35,000, much of which covered travel costs. Currently, he serves as a statistical data administrator, compiling and analyzing daily golf statistics from caddies' reports. His findings are in high demand by television commentators, golf magazines, and players. C. Martin Fern: Martin edits the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper, which involves dining in top restaurants. He believes that exorbitant restaurant prices are acceptable for those who can pay, preferring memorable meals over expensive appliances. His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend, providing extra income while he worked in advertising. At age 42, he accepted a full-time newspaper job with a significant pay cut to turn his passion into a profession. He cooks at home and cycles to the tube station to manage his weight. D. Dick Prince: Dick Prince, a renowned children's author, began writing stories two decades ago, transitioning from writing verse. His first published story, The Fox Busters, was inspired by his farming background and featured a role reversal theme. He generates ideas through diligent morning work and types them on an old portable typewriter, avoiding laptops. He receives 50 to 100 weekly letters from readers, which he greatly enjoys responding to, now assisted by secretarial support.","It's a tough job? 

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they're as wonderful as they seem. 

A. Raquel Graham 

Raquel Graham rings from the taxi taking her to the airport. She can't make our appointment tomorrow because her boss wants her to be in Los Angeles instead. When you're personal assistant to a pop star, you're expected to jet around the world at the drop of a hat. Raquel loves her job and gets on well with her boss. 
There's just one minor problem - she can't stand flying. 'On a nine-hour trip to California I usually take sleeping tablets to help calm me down,' she admits. Her worst experience was being on Concorde. 'It seemed so shut in with those tiny windows.' 
Offices in Manchester and London occupy her when she comes down to earth. There's some mundane paperwork to get through - organising the diary, sitting in on meetings with solicitors and accountants, sorting out itineraries and making yet more travel arrangements. 
She didn't apply for the job. A chance meeting with the manager of a pop group led to the offer of work behind the scenes and she took a secretarial certificate at evening classes at the same time. Five years later she was in the right place at the right time when her boss needed a PA. 

B. David Brown 

David Brown has been an accountant and a golf caddy; a man who carries a golfer's bags. On the whole, he preferred the golf. Well, so would you if golf was your passion. There were drawbacks however. A small flat fee is on offer, plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between PS25,000 and PS35,000 and much of that will go on travel and hotels. 
He was 31 when he first caddied for the golfer, Greg Norman. 'You're not just carrying bags. You're offering advice, pitting your knowledge against the elements and trying to read the course.' 
His accountancy skills were recently recognised by European Tour Productions when they made him statistical data administrator. From cards brought in by the caddies, he compiles and analyses the statistics of each day's play. The results are sought after by television commentators, golfing magazines, and the golfers themselves. 

C. Martin Fern 

Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper and one of his less difficult tasks is to sample what's on offer in the finest restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge exorbitant prices? 'For those who can afford it, it's up to them,' he says. 'I'd rather spend PS120 on a meal I'll remember for the rest of my life than buy a microwave.' 
It was his talent as a cook that led to the offer of a food column from a friend who happened to edit a Saturday Review. For Martin, at the time creative director of an advertising agency, it was a useful secondary income. He was 42 when another newspaper rang to offer a full-time job. 'It meant a 50 per cent cut in guaranteed income,' he says. 'But it was a chance to convert my passion into a profession.' 
He still does all the cooking at home and tries to keep his waistline under control by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station. 

D. Dick Prince 

'I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,' says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. 'Before that, I had always loved words and enjoyed using them, but my writing had mainly been verse. Then I had this idea for a story. I had been a farmer, and knew the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. 
So I wrote a kind of role reversal story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's story.' 
Where do his ideas come from? 'Well, it's not easy, I have to work at them,' he says. 'That is what I usually do in the mornings. I'm not up with the dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend another couple of hours typing out the morning's scribbling - all of which I do with one finger on an old portable typewriter rather than on one of those awful laptops. 
I get between 50 and a hundred letters a week and that is the part about being a writer that I enjoy the most. I do try to answer them all, but nowadays I have some secretarial help.' ","Is it a demanding occupation? Chris Arnot interrogates four individuals with ostensibly ideal careers regarding whether they are as idyllic as they appear. A. Raquel Graham: As the personal assistant to a pop star, Raquel is frequently required to jet across the globe at a moment's notice. She derives satisfaction from her role and maintains an amicable rapport with her employer; however, she harbors an aversion to air travel, often resorting to sedatives during protracted journeys. Her most harrowing experience occurred aboard Concorde, which she found claustrophobic due to its diminutive windows. During intervals between travels, she attends to mundane administrative duties in offices located in Manchester and London, encompassing diary coordination, participation in legal and financial consultations, itinerary organization, and further travel logistics. She secured this position fortuitously after an incidental meeting with a music group manager, concurrently obtaining a secretarial qualification through evening studies. Half a decade later, she was opportunely situated to assume the PA role when the necessity arose. B. David Brown: David's professional trajectory includes tenures as an accountant and a golf caddy, the latter involving carrying equipment and proffering strategic counsel while contending with environmental variables and course intricacies. He exhibited a predilection for caddying, aligned with his ardor for golf, notwithstanding its pecuniary limitations—compensation comprising a nominal flat fee augmented by a percentage of winnings, with average annual earnings ranging from £25,000 to £35,000, substantially allocated to travel and accommodation expenditures. Presently, he holds the position of statistical data administrator for European Tour Productions, wherein he synthesizes and scrutinizes daily performance metrics derived from caddies' submissions. His analytical outputs are highly coveted by television analysts, periodicals, and professional golfers. C. Martin Fern: Martin Fern serves as the editor for the 'Food and Drink' segment of a daily periodical, a capacity that entails gastronomic evaluation in premier dining establishments. He opines that restaurants charging exorbitant fees are justifiable for affluent patrons, asserting he would preferentially allocate funds toward an unforgettable culinary experience rather than mundane appliances. His culinary prowess precipitated an invitation to author a food column from an acquaintance editing a Saturday Review, furnishing supplementary remuneration during his tenure as creative director at an advertising firm. At 42, he acquiesced to a full-time editorial offer, incurring a 50% reduction in assured income to transmute his avocation into a vocation. He persists in domestic culinary endeavors and mitigates weight gain by cycling several miles to the nearest underground station. D. Dick Prince: Dick Prince, an eminent British children's author, commenced story composition approximately two decades prior, having previously engaged predominantly in verse. His inaugural published work, The Fox Busters, emerged from agricultural experiences, depicting a narrative of role inversion concerning poultry and predators. He cultivates concepts through assiduous morning sessions, subsequently transcribing his manuscripts via an antiquated portable typewriter, eschewing modern laptops. He is the recipient of 50 to 100 epistolary communications weekly, a facet of authorship he particularly relishes; he endeavors to respond to all, facilitated by secretarial assistance in contemporary times.","Does it constitute an arduous profession? Chris Arnot poses this query to four individuals endowed with what are perceived as dream occupations, probing whether these roles are as superlative as they are ostensibly portrayed. A. Raquel Graham: In her capacity as personal assistant to a pop luminary, Raquel is perpetually on call to traverse the globe precipitously, a demand she meets with alacrity, fostering an efficacious dynamic with her employer. Notwithstanding her professional contentment, she is afflicted with aerophobia, routinely employing hypnotics to ameliorate anxiety during intercontinental sojourns; her most disquieting episode was aboard Concorde, whose constricted cabin and minuscule fenestration induced profound discomfort. During terrestrial interludes, she discharges prosaic responsibilities in Manchester and London offices, involving meticulous diary orchestration, attendance at conclaves with legal and financial advisors, itinerary delineation, and perpetual travel arrangements. Her accession to this role was serendipitous, ensuing from a fortuitous encounter with a musical ensemble's manager, during which she concurrently pursued a secretarial certification via nocturnal instruction. A quinquennium later, her serendipitous positioning enabled her assumption of the PA mantle upon its vacancy. B. David Brown: David's vocational history encompasses spells as an accountant and a golf caddy, the latter entailing not merely porterage but also the dispensation of sagacious counsel, pitting his acumen against elemental vicissitudes and topographic nuances. He evinced a partiality for caddying, consonant with his fervent devotion to golf, despite its fiscal impediments—remuneration comprising a nominal stipend supplemented by a fraction of tournament earnings, with mean annual income bracketed between £25,000 and £35,000, a substantial portion expended on peripatetic and hospitiality costs. In his current incarnation as statistical data administrator for European Tour Productions, he amalgamates and dissects diurnal performance indices furnished by caddies, yielding insights avidly solicited by televisual commentators, golfing publications, and the athletes themselves. C. Martin Fern: Martin Fern holds the editorship of the 'Food and Drink' division of a diurnal newspaper, a remit that incorporates epicurean assessment in gastronomic temples. He propounds that establishments levying exorbitant tariffs are defensible for the pecuniously endowed, professing a preference for allocating resources toward a memorable repast over acquisitive mundanities like microwaves. His gastronomic virtuosity precipitated an overture to contribute a culinary column from a confrère editing a Saturday Review, proffering ancillary income during his incumbency as creative director at an advertising agency. At the age of 42, he embraced a full-time editorial proposition, incurring a halving of guaranteed earnings to effectuate the metamorphosis of his passion into a profession. He continues to undertake all domestic cookery and employs cycling as a metric to circumscribe his waistline, traversing a couple of miles to the proximate tube station. D. Dick Prince: Dick Prince, a preeminent British scribe of juvenile literature, initiated storycraft approximately two decades ago, having previously confined his literary exertions predominantly to verse. His seminal published work, The Fox Busters, was conceived from his agrarian background, articulating a thematic inversion wherein poultry outmaneuver a predator. He engenders ideas through diligent matutinal labor, subsequently committing his scribbled musings to type via a venerable portable typewriter, a medium he favors over contemporary laptops. He is the beneficiary of a weekly deluge of 50 to 100 letters, an aspect of authorship he cherishes above all; he strives to acknowledge each communiqué, a task now abetted by secretarial support."
193,"Trying to get published?

If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need.
Readers of this magazine often write in saying, 'I have written this story / book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should be researching their markets and finding out about publishers as well as practising their writing skills. Turning words into a saleable commodity takes a good deal of knowledge about the 'writing game'.
Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. There are several ways of doing this, but the best one is simply by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.
As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated as new publications are constantly appearing - editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always hungry for new blood; as writers we have to make sure we give them what they want.
To begin with you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let us say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The very first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, taking special note of who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in catering to their needs.
Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never actively discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is of publishable standard; so I have to try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint.
The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about so-called success', you usually find that the person has been in the publishing trade or journalism for some years before their current success.
When you do finally send off some of your work for the first time, immediately get on with more work while you await a reply; write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you will begin to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and your confidence will grow. Don't tear any of them up-improve them instead. Also, I would advise not showing your work to anyone else, certainly in the early stages.
Don't forget that every successful writer will have had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See whether there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group which will help you to gain ideas and confidence from mixing with other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and get that writing practice in - every day if possible.",B2,"Do you want to publish your story? Margaret Stubbs can help. First, learn about publishers. Read many books and magazines. This helps you know what publishers want. Things change often, so keep learning. If you like love stories, find magazines that use them. Read those magazines. New writers often send stories too soon. Write many stories to get better. Do not throw them away. Make them better. Many writers get no at first. Join a writing group or take a class. Think of yourself as a writer. Write every day.","Are you trying to get your story published? Margaret Stubbs gives advice. First, research publishers and markets. Read a lot of books and magazines to understand what is popular. Markets change, so update your knowledge. For example, if you write love stories, find magazines that publish them and study their stories. New writers often send work too early. It is better to write many stories first to improve. Do not destroy your work; revise it. Most writers face rejections before success. Join a writing group or course to gain confidence. Practice writing regularly.","If you are seeking publication, Margaret Stubbs offers guidance. Begin by researching potential publishers and understanding the market through extensive reading of relevant materials. Since publishing trends evolve with new titles and editorial changes, stay informed. For instance, if you aim to write love stories, identify suitable magazines and analyze their content to grasp reader expectations. Many novice writers submit work prematurely; instead, focus on producing multiple pieces to enhance skills and build confidence. Rejections are common, so persist and consider joining writing groups or courses for support and development.","Trying to get published?

Initially, conduct thorough market research by perusing a wide array of publications to discern prevailing trends and publisher preferences. Given the dynamic nature of the industry, with frequent launches of new titles and shifts in editorial focus, continuous updating of knowledge is imperative. For example, should one specialize in romantic fiction, it is essential to scrutinize periodicals that feature such narratives and comprehend their target readership. Novice writers often prematurely submit manuscripts; a more prudent approach involves composing numerous works to refine one's craft and fortify self-assurance. Embracing rejections as part of the process and engaging in writing communities or educational programs can significantly advance one's literary career.","For those endeavoring to achieve publication, Margaret Stubbs proffers sagacious counsel. Commence by undertaking meticulous market research, immersing oneself in a breadth of pertinent literature to apprehend contemporary publishing inclinations. The sector's volatility, characterized by the incessant emergence of new publications and editorial realignments, necessitates perpetual vigilance. In the case of aspiring romance authors, it is paramount to identify suitable magazines and conduct an exhaustive analysis of their acquisitions to align with reader demographics. Inexperienced writers frequently dispatch submissions precipitously; a more judicious strategy entails the prolific composition of works to hone stylistic proficiency and cultivate authorial confidence. Perseverance through inevitable rejections, coupled with participation in writing collectives or specialized courses, is instrumental in fostering professional development."

Bruce
I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. Cycling was a release from school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, the sheltered valleys and old villages. Coming from Scotland myself, I found the landscape familiar yet different and I still go back there today. I used to describe my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, at which I subsequently made my name.

Sophia
There is a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by amateurs. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep, and alongside a canal. But there is one point on the journey that I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers spy on people at random points in their day, making a cup of tea, doing the washing up, unfolding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields and sheep and a distant grey sea. That makes me look more closely, to search for something that opens my eyes.

Matthew
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and lovely coast. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks, so crowds are largely non-existent here. They attract a few brave surfers but most visitors prefer instead to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns and wild flowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who have some property in the village of Southole.

Annette
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, or with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in an urban environment.

James
I purchased Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was a question of obtaining pure peace and reconnecting with my English roots and coming home. I grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway you'd never return.That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magic, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except sea, wind and birds.

I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. Cycling was a release from school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, the sheltered valleys and old villages. Coming from Scotland myself, I found the landscape familiar yet different and I still go back there today. I used to describe my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, at which I subsequently made my name.

Sophia
There is a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by amateurs. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep, and alongside a canal. But there is one point on the journey that I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers spy on people at random points in their day, making a cup of tea, doing the washing up, unfolding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields and sheep and a distant grey sea. That makes me look more closely, to search for something that opens my eyes.

Matthew
The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and lovely coast. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks, so crowds are largely non-existent here. They attract a few brave surfers but most visitors prefer instead to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns and wild flowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who have some property in the village of Southole.

Annette
My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, or with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in an urban environment.

James
I purchased Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was a question of obtaining pure peace and reconnecting with my English roots and coming home. I grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway you'd never return.That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams. It's a magic, secluded, romantic house. You can't hear anything except sea, wind and birds.

","{'Bruce': 'Bruce eschews landscapes that are entirely untamed, emphasizing the significance of the human element in his appreciation of scenery. This inclination persists in his international travels, where he is captivated by picturesque villages adorned with ancient temples, in contrast to desolate deserts. At the age of eight, he was sent to school in England and would cycle to the village of Lastingham on Saturdays, finding cycling a liberating escape from academic rigors. He delighted in exploring the austere hilltops, protected valleys, and historic villages. Hailing from Scotland, the terrain felt simultaneously familiar and novel, and he continues to frequent the area. He chronicled his exploits in a private diary, which constituted his inaugural endeavor in travel writing, a domain in which he subsequently established his reputation.', 'Sophia': ""Sophia derives pleasure from a miniature railway journey from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by enthusiasts, invariably selecting first-class accommodation owing to its nominal additional expense. The vista across Romney Marsh, with its grazing sheep and adjacent canal, lacks grandeur, yet she eagerly anticipates the segment where the train meanders through residential gardens. During this interlude, passengers surreptitiously observe individuals engaged in mundane tasks, such as brewing tea or arranging deckchairs. She envisions herself through their perspective as a woman ensconced in a diminutive carriage, peering into domestic spheres. The landscape's banality, comprising fields, livestock, and a far-off grey sea, enthralls her, inciting a meticulous scrutiny in pursuit of revelatory insights."", 'Matthew': ""Matthew holds the Hartland Peninsula in high regard for its secluded and enchanting coastline, where beaches are arduous to access and littered with rocky outcrops, thereby deterring large crowds. It entices a minority of intrepid surfers, while the majority of visitors prefer to meditate upon the ocean's majesty. This Atlantic-facing shore is notorious for its history of shipwrecks. Coastal promenades can be amalgamated with forays inland through verdant, humid valleys replete with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. He resides in unpretentious self-catering accommodations hosted by a family with holdings in the village of Southole."", 'Annette': ""Annette's predilection lies with the Trough of Bowland in England, a vast expanse of moorland exceptionally suited for hiking. Sparsely populated and infrequently visited, it remains an obscure, desolate, and remote enclave that she cherishes for its sensation of expansiveness. She chanced upon the locale during her student days and has undertaken annual pilgrimages since, initially solo, subsequently with her partner, and now accompanied by her son. The area has undergone negligible transformation, and the inclusion of her child imbues these sojourns with heightened significance, though she laments his upbringing in an urban milieu."", 'James': ""James procured Glenthorne, his esteemed residence in Britain, driven by a quest for absolute serenity and a reconnection with his English ancestry. Having been raised in contemporary Sri Lanka, he relocated to a school in Devon at twelve, where he traversed the moors and village byways by bicycle. A local legend cautioned that descending Glenthorne's driveway would result in one's perpetual absence. He now possesses this mystical, sequestered, and romantic abode, where auditory stimuli are confined to the sea, wind, and avian sounds, thus actualizing his aspirational visions.""}","{'Bruce': 'Bruce disdains landscapes that are wholly untamed, attributing paramount importance to the human element in his aesthetic evaluations. This proclivity extends to his peregrinations abroad, where he is irresistibly drawn to idyllic villages replete with antiquated temples, eschewing barren deserts. At the tender age of eight, he was dispatched to an English boarding school and would habitually cycle to Lastingham village on Saturdays, regarding cycling as a cathartic release from scholastic confines. He reveled in traversing the stark hilltops, sequestered valleys, and time-honored villages.

During this ephemeral interval, passengers engage in voyeuristic observations of individuals partaking in quotidian rituals, such as infusing tea or deploying deckchairs. She conceptualizes her own reflection in their gaze as a woman ensconced within a diminutive carriage, intruding upon domestic sanctums. The landscape's prosaic nature, characterized by pastoral fields, grazing sheep, and a distant ashen sea, captivates her, provoking an intense scrutiny in a quest for epiphanic revelations."", 'Matthew': ""Matthew venerates the Hartland Peninsula for its isolated and sublime coastline, where beaches are formidable to access and strewn with lithic debris, consequently precluding throngs of visitors. It magnetizes a coterie of audacious surfers, whilst the preponderance of sojourners elect to ruminate upon the ocean's grandeur. This littoral expanse, confronting the Atlantic, is infamous for its legacy of maritime disasters. Littoral ambulations can be synergistically combined with incursions inland through luxuriant, humid valleys teeming with Quercus species, pteridophytes, and indigenous flora. He quarters in unassuming self-catering lodgings provided by a familial unit with proprietary interests in the hamlet of Southole."", 'Annette': ""Annette's ardor is reserved for the Trough of Bowland in England, an extensive tract of moorland supremely conducive to pedestrian excursions. Demographically sparse and seldom frequented, it persists as an arcane, uninhabited, and remote precinct that she prizes for its palpable sense of spatial liberation. She serendipitously encountered the region during her academic tenure and has instituted annual visitations thenceforth, initially in solitude, subsequently with her consort, and now in the company of her progeny. The terrain has undergone infinitesimal alteration, and the incorporation of her offspring augments the poignancy of these expeditions, notwithstanding her melancholic reflection on his urbanized upbringing."", 'James': ""James secured ownership of Glenthorne, his venerated domicile in Britain, motivated by an aspiration for unadulterated tranquility and a rekindling of his English patrimony. Having been nurtured in contemporary Sri Lanka, he transitioned to an educational institution in Devon at the age of twelve, where he would perambulate the moors and village thoroughfares via bicycle. A pervasive anecdote admonished that traversing Glenthorne's carriageway would culminate in one's irrevocable disappearance. He now holds title to this enchanting, reclusive, and amorous residence, where aural perceptions are confined to the susurrus of the sea, the zephyr, and avian vocalizations, thereby materializing his oneiric aspirations.""}"

'I actually look rather good in jeans. So I rarely wear them. I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.' So runs the logic of Isabel, 'our heroine' in this refreshingly zany novel. An art student of 31, devotee of historical romances, she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. Hope, however, springs eternal - which proves to be her salvation, and that of other people in the story. Employing the staccato drama-laden pace of an early silent film, with chapter headings like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired', the author writes with terrific verve.

This is a celebration of the birth and subsequent near-death of a local radio station in America. It is the wry view of a national institution - the wireless - seen through the eyes of a weedy, intelligent child, Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station set up by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to advertise their sandwich bar. Soon the station is beaming out a motley collection of singers, preachers, soap-opera heroes and continuity announcers. This small-town American setting provides the author with huge scope for the dry humour and understated prose for which he is justly praised. He skilfully transports the reader from the present back to the gentler days of the 1940s and 1950s, an era of dime stores, oil-cloth, old-fashioned Ford motor cars and, of course, the wireless.

In the world created by the author, it is quite in order for a second husband to gossip with his wive's first husband. So, when high-flying professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poetess, he naturally confides in his wive's ex. The poetess writes rotten poetry, which troubles Richards critical conscience; she's also trying to get his support for her wrongfully imprisoned brother. However, none of these complications is half as interesting as the way the author untangles them. He moves the plot along with a robust sense of the ridiculous and dissects relationships with perceptive care. It all makes for a highly enjoyable, sophisticated and witty read.

Two sets of best friends - two women, two men - meet in the London of the sixties, and for the next quarter of a century are bound together in life and death. At the outset of this long novel, one of the four, the mysterious American tycoon, James Hudson, is launching a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The launch is crucial, but so is the fact that the woman they both adored (and that one of them married) was killed some years before... Murder, ambition, love and jealousy - it's all here, and the writing's good as well. This is one of those books, in size and range, where you can really get to know the characters and be engrossed in them.

196,"BRINGING UP BADGERS

'What now?' was my immediate thought, as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago, we've established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box -- a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads.
I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her.
I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours.
Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented. Three weeks after their arrival, however, I noticed that Willow seemed lethargic, although he was still taking food as normal. It was a warning sign. I should have reacted straightaway; not realising its importance, I awoke the next morning to find him dead.
The vets post mortem revealed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle feeding any animal it is important not to let it drink too fast, as liquid can overflow into the lungs. In Willows case this had caused an infection that would have been difficult to rectify, even with the help of antibiotics, in one so small.
Disheartened by my failure, I continued rearing the others. But fate works in strange ways: six days later a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. Behind some silage bags he had discovered a single male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return; the area had been disturbed too much and already the cub was cold and hungry.
Willow II joined the fold. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females and over the next few days I discovered why his mother had left him. Never had anything been so difficult to feed. To place the bottles teat in his mouth and cajole him into drinking I had to keep moving it around and squeezing it. After a full 10 minutes he would latch on to it as if he had not drunk all day. By the end of April the females were weaned on to creamed rice and then literally anything. It was to be a different story for Willow. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food, tipping it over or just sitting in it. Eventually I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages he was ready to move on to something else.
At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast; a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. The usual diet for badgers is 60 per cent earthworms, plus beetles and bugs, baby rabbits, mice and voles and even shoots or roots of plants. Certainly my badgers were much better off than other cubs that year; the summer was exceptionally hot and digging for earthworms must have been almost impossible.
By August my foundlings had begun to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often went through the cider orchard; in its long grass, everyone was fair game. The cubs would get excited, ruffle up their fur so that they looked like snowballs and chase each other's tails. As 'human badgers' we were included in this sport. I learnt to avoid those playful charges that ended with a sharp nip, but Derek accompanied us only occasionally and so never grasped this skill: his reactions to being caught were sometimes as colourful as his bruises.
It was during two of these late-night walks in the very dry period that I spotted odder badgers in our field. Presumably they were having to extend their territories to find enough food, although badgers are very territorial and will kill others that wander into their territory. We were even warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so sheet metal was placed over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers, and such was the response that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With advice freely given, we designed our badgers' new home. Daniel, one of our sons, drew up the plans and we built a sett complete with tunnels, an enclosure and a badger gate facing the same way as their nightly walks.
It had three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass side to enable people to see into the sett from a darkened enclosure. As the sett began to take shape, the badgers would explore it before going on their walks. Eventually walks were forgotten in the excitement of climbing through the tunnels and sorting out bedding.
The cost of the building work was far more than we envisaged but a local bus company (the aptly named Badgerline) sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated building materials. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own.
Early one evening they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later I crept back to see if all was well, to be met with the sight of three badgers curled up in their chambers sound asleep.
These days my walks with them are not as regular, especially as they are not fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally (she has joined a neighbouring sett) but
Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, an area that they have come to know well and a home they have readily accepted.",C1,"I have a farm. My helper gave me a box. In the box were three small badger babies. They were grey and had black and white heads. Their eyes were milky. They were cold and making noise. I took them to my kitchen to warm them. I gave them names: Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow. I fed them with a syringe. After a week, they drank from a bottle. Willow got sick and died. The vet said he had a lung infection. I was sad. Later, a farmer gave me another badger baby. I called him Willow II. He was hard to feed. The badgers grew up. They ate different foods. They liked to play at night. We built a home for them on the farm. Now, they live in their new home. Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello.","One day, my helper gave me a cardboard box. Inside, I found three small badger cubs. They were grey with black and white striped heads and milky eyes. They were cold and crying. I took them to the kitchen to warm them by the stove. I named them Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe. After a week, they drank from a bottle. Sadly, Willow became sick and died. The vet said he had a lung infection from drinking too fast. I felt very sad. Later, a farmer brought me another badger cub, and I named him Willow II. He was difficult to feed. The badgers grew and started eating solid food. They enjoyed playing at night. We built a special home for them on the farm with tunnels. Now, they live there happily, and Bluebell and Willow II often come to greet me.","When my helper handed me a cardboard box, I discovered three small badger cubs inside. They were grey with black and white striped heads and had milky-coloured eyes. The cubs were cold and whimpering, so I took them into the farmhouse kitchen to warm them beside the stove. I named the two females Primrose and Bluebell and the male Willow. Initially, I fed them using a syringe, and after a week, they progressed to drinking from a bottle. Unfortunately, Willow became lethargic and died from a lung infection, as revealed by a vet's post-mortem. Disheartened, I continued caring for the others. Soon after, a local farmer brought me another male cub, whom I named Willow II. He was challenging to feed, but eventually, all the badgers were weaned onto solid foods. As they grew, they became nocturnal and enjoyed playful walks at dusk. We constructed a sett for them on the farm with tunnels and chambers, funded by local donations. Now, Bluebell and Willow II still rush to greet me, while Primrose has joined a neighbouring sett.","Upon receiving a cardboard box from a helper, I peered inside to find three small badger cubs, each with a grey velvet coat and milky eyes set in black-and-white striped heads. They were cold and whimpering, so I brought them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them near the stove for warmth. I named the two females Primrose and Bluebell and the male Willow. Initially, I fed them with a syringe, simulating maternal care, and within a week, they were drinking from a bottle. Tragically, Willow became lethargic and died; a post-mortem examination indicated a lung infection likely caused by rapid bottle feeding. Despite this setback, I persevered with the others. A few days later, a farmer brought another male cub, Willow II, who proved exceptionally difficult to feed. As the badgers matured, they transitioned to a varied diet and exhibited nocturnal behaviors, engaging in playful chases during evening walks. To provide a permanent home, we designed and built a sett with tunnels and viewing chambers, supported by local sponsors. Nowadays, Bluebell and Willow II frequently approach to greet me, though Primrose has relocated to a nearby sett.","BRINGING UP BADGERS

'What now?' was my immediate thought, as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago, we've established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box -- a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads.
I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her.
I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours.
Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented. Three weeks after their arrival, however, I noticed that Willow seemed lethargic, although he was still taking food as normal. It was a warning sign. I should have reacted straightaway; not realising its importance, I awoke the next morning to find him dead.
The vets post mortem revealed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle feeding any animal it is important not to let it drink too fast, as liquid can overflow into the lungs. In Willows case this had caused an infection that would have been difficult to rectify, even with the help of antibiotics, in one so small.
Disheartened by my failure, I continued rearing the others. But fate works in strange ways: six days later a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. Behind some silage bags he had discovered a single male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return; the area had been disturbed too much and already the cub was cold and hungry.
Willow II joined the fold. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females and over the next few days I discovered why his mother had left him. Never had anything been so difficult to feed. To place the bottles teat in his mouth and cajole him into drinking I had to keep moving it around and squeezing it. After a full 10 minutes he would latch on to it as if he had not drunk all day. By the end of April the females were weaned on to creamed rice and then literally anything. It was to be a different story for Willow. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food, tipping it over or just sitting in it. Eventually I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages he was ready to move on to something else.

Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night. This is their territory now, an area that they have come to know well and a home they have readily accepted.","My immediate reaction to a helper proffering a cardboard box was one of curiosity, which was soon satisfied upon discerning three diminutive badger cubs within, their grey coats reminiscent of velvet and milky eyes gazing upwards from distinctly striped visages. Chilled and emitting plaintive whimpers, they were swiftly transported to the farmhouse kitchen and installed adjacent to the stove for thermal comfort. Christened Primrose, Bluebell, and Willow, the cubs were initially nourished via syringe, with meticulous wiping to emulate maternal licking, thereby stimulating excretion. Within a week, they graduated to bottle feeding, yet Willow succumbed to lethargy and expired; a subsequent post-mortem attributed his demise to a pulmonary infection, potentially exacerbated by precipitous ingestion during feeding. Undeterred by this misfortune, I persisted in rearing the survivors, and shortly thereafter, a local farmer introduced a supplementary male cub, designated Willow II, whose recalcitrance at feeding presented considerable challenges. As the badgers developed, they adopted nocturnal proclivities, reveling in crepuscular ambulations and frolicsome pursuits. In response to communal interest, we engineered an elaborate sett complete with subterranean tunnels and observational chambers, financed through philanthropic contributions. Presently, Bluebell and Willow II maintain affable interactions, whereas Primrose has integrated into an adjacent social group, each having acclimated to their designated territory."
197,"Blacksmiths

THROUGHOUT the ages, iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination, and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers, because they were the sole providers of weapons, armour and farming tools.
They have also been feted as artises. Eighteenth-century smiths produced the wonderfully baroque ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The sinuous metalwork of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was always the work of a talented blacksmith.
But practitioners of these ancient skills had become almost extinct in Britain by the late 1960s, for heavy industry had ceased to have any use for them, and towerblock architects rarely used anything as graceful and pleasing as a wrought-iron handrail.
Over the past 10 years, however, there has been something of a revival - thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Even so, much of the work looks surprisingly cliched: manufacturers of gates and balconies still advertise their wares as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. You cant walk into a trendy design store without being assailed by rusty candlesticks with dangly bits.
Thankfully, alternatives exist and a series of events over the next few weeks aims to promote the blacksmiths craft. The first of these, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the
Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.
Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says: 'We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because, in a sense, both the general public and blacksmiths have had their blinkers removed.' Power tools have liberated smiths from all that labouring over a hot anvil, and they can now bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material which allows them to express themselves.'
About 250 pieces have been produced for the show, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at PS90 and climb well into four figures. Most of the money raised will go to individual makers, 'but a percentage of every sale will be retained by the Association for the promotion of good ironwork,' says Dawson.
His own contributions consist of an eight-foot gate, and a standard lamp topped with a mouth-blown glass shade.
'My style results from just allowing steel to bend and flow into shape when its hot. It's a bit like drawing with metal in space,' he says.
Many of the artists admit to being fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are relatively malleable when cold, iron and steel are a tougher, more demanding medium. Susan May, a jeweller by training, says, 'It's quite magical, because its incredibly soft when its hot, but as soon as it cools down, it becomes really rigid and immovable again.'
Ann Catrin Evans' mild steel door-knockers and handles seem to have been inspired by those bleak castles that are a stock feature of horror films. One of her designs is shaped like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love the fact that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And the way it feels as though its there forever.'
No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good, to say the least as long as we don't have to look at any more rusty Candlesticks, that is.",C1,"Blacksmiths make things from iron. Long ago, they were very important. They made weapons, armor, and tools. People thought they were like doctors. Blacksmiths also made beautiful art. For example, they made iron for St Paul's Cathedral. But by the 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths in Britain. Big factories did not need them. Buildings did not use iron rails. Now, blacksmiths are coming back. People like nice buildings and homes. There is a show of iron art in Leatherhead. It has many things like bookends and stairs. Prices start at £90. Alan Dawson says blacksmiths can now use power tools. This makes work easier. Iron is soft when hot and hard when cold. Artists like this. Iron makes people happy and safe. We hope to see more good iron art, not old rusty things.","Blacksmiths work with iron. For a long time, iron has been important to people. Blacksmiths were seen as more than just workers.

French and Belgian buildings had beautiful ironwork by blacksmiths. But by the late 1960s, blacksmiths were almost gone in Britain. Heavy industry did not need them, and new buildings did not use wrought iron. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival. People are more interested in decorative architecture and design. However, much work is clichéd, like 'Victorian-style' gates. There is an exhibition by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association in Leatherhead. Alan Dawson says blacksmiths now use power tools, so they can bend and weld metal easily. The show has about 250 pieces, from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths occupied a status comparable to physicians and astrologers, as they were the exclusive suppliers of weaponry, armour, and agricultural implements. They have also been lauded as artists; eighteenth-century blacksmiths produced exquisitely baroque ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, while the sinuous metal embellishments characteristic of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture were invariably crafted by talented smiths. Nevertheless, by the late 1960s, practitioners of this ancient skill had verged on extinction in Britain, owing to the decline of heavy industry and the infrequent use of graceful wrought-iron features, such as handrails, in modernist tower block designs. Over the preceding decade, however, a modest resurgence has occurred, fueled by heightened appreciation for ornamental architecture and a more liberal approach to interior aesthetics. Despite this, a considerable portion of contemporary work appears surprisingly trite, with manufacturers of gates and balconies persistently marketing their products as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style,' and ubiquitous trendy design stores cluttered with rusty candlesticks adorned with superfluous appendages. Thankfully, alternatives are emerging, and a series of forthcoming events seeks to advance the blacksmith's craft, commencing with an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, posits that we might be at the dawn of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths have shed their limitations; power tools have emancipated smiths from arduous anvil labour, enabling them to manipulate metal—bending, splitting, twisting, and spot-welding—with relative facility. In essence, these artists now possess a medium that facilitates self-expression. The exhibition comprises approximately 250 pieces, spanning from bookends to a spiral staircase, with reserve prices initiating at £90 and ascending into four figures. Proceeds primarily benefit the artisans, though a portion is retained by the Association to foster superior ironwork. Dawson's contributions include an eight-foot gate and a standard lamp crowned with a mouth-blown glass shade, reflecting a style that allows steel to flow organically into form when heated, akin to sketching with metal in space. Many artists confess an allure to iron; unlike most metals, which remain malleable cold, iron and steel present a more formidable, exacting medium. Susan May, a trained jeweller, describes it as magical due to its pliability at high temperatures and immediate rigidity upon cooling. Ann Catrin Evans' mild steel door-knockers and handles evoke the austere castles typical of horror films, with designs resembling a ball and chain or a Celtic cross, celebrating steel's enduring, cold hardness. No other base metal has afforded humanity equivalent aesthetic delight or a profounder sense of security. The prospects for iron's decorative utilisation over the next millennium are robust, provided we eschew the proliferation of rusty candlesticks.","Blacksmiths

Antecedent to the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths commanded a stature analogous to that of physicians and astrologers, given their monopoly on the provision of armaments, protective gear, and agrarian implements. They have likewise been venerated as artists; eighteenth-century smiths fabricated the wondrously baroque iron embellishments for St Paul's Cathedral, whilst the sinuous metallic filigree emblematic of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was invariably the oeuvre of adept blacksmiths. However, by the terminus of the 1960s, exponents of these arcane skills had verged on obsolescence in Britain, as heavy industry had obviated their utility, and the architects of tower blocks seldom incorporated anything as aesthetically pleasing and graceful as wrought-iron handrails. Over the preceding decennium, nonetheless, a nascent renaissance has materialised—attributable to augmented interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative ethos in interior design. Notwithstanding this, a substantial proportion of the output appears disconcertingly hackneyed: purveyors of gates and balconies persist in advertising their merchandise as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style,' and one cannot ingress a modish design emporium without being assailed by oxidised candlesticks replete with pendulous accoutrements. Fortuitously, alternatives subsist, and a sequence of imminent events aspires to promulgate the blacksmith's craft. The inaugural occurrence, an exhibition of forged ironwork by affiliates of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association, commenced last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, avers, 'We could be at the inception of a new Iron Age, because, in a sense, both the general public and blacksmiths have had their blinkers removed.' Power tools have emancipated smiths from the drudgery of labouring over a scorching anvil, permitting them to bend, split, twist, and spot-weld the metal with comparative alacrity. 'In essence,' Dawson articulates, 'these artists now possess a material that enables them to articulate their creativity.' Approximately 250 pieces have been produced for the exhibition, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase; reserve prices commence at £90 and escalate well into four figures. The majority of the revenue will be allocated to individual makers, 'but a percentage of every sale will be retained by the Association for the promotion of exemplary ironwork,' Dawson elucidates. His own contributions encompass an eight-foot gate and a standard lamp surmounted by a mouth-blown glass shade. 'My stylistic approach emanates from permitting steel to bend and flow into shape when incandescent. It is somewhat analogous to delineating with metal in space,' he expounds. Numerous artists concede to being enthralled by iron; unlike most metals, which remain relatively malleable in a cold state, iron and steel constitute a more intractable, exigent medium. Susan May, a jeweller by training, remarks, 'It is quite magical, because it is incredibly pliant when heated, but upon cooling, it reverts to being profoundly rigid and immovable.' Ann Catrin Evans' mild steel door-knockers and handles appear to have been inspired by those desolate castles that are a staple of horror cinema; one of her designs is configured like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I adore the fact that steel is frigid and unyielding,' she states. 'And the manner in which it imparts a sensation of perpetual presence.' No other base metal has bequeathed humanity such visual gratification or a more profound sentiment of security. The likelihood of iron being employed decoratively for the ensuing millennium is considerable, to understate the matter—provided we are not compelled to behold any additional rusty candlesticks, that is."
198,"Talking shop

Ever entered a store and come away with more than you intended to buy? We reveal the selling devices shops use that are designed to make you spend, spend, spend.

A. The image of freshness 

Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They may place their fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale, to enhance this. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store. The colour of the store's fixtures may heighten the image, too - for example, green may be used because of its association with fresh produce. The bulk of what supermarkets sell -
pre-packaged grocery items such as frozen foods and washing powders - may be quite different from this image.

B. Displaying to advantage

The location of products in the store is considered all-important in determining how well a particular brand sells. Nowhere is this more developed than in supermarkets. With computerised stock-control, supermarkets can find out the parts of the store from which shoppers will select items most often. In these areas can be found products with the highest mark-ups or ones which, though less profitable, sell very quickly. 
Traditionally in retailing, 'eye-level means 'buy-level' -- shelves at eye height are eagerly sought by manufacturers, or may be reserved for certain own-brand items. 'Dump bins' containing special offers tempt those who find it hard to resist a bargain.
Increasingly popular is 'complementation' - placing dessert or salad dressings, say, over units containing ice-creams or items that may be eaten with salads such as burgers.

C. Spreading staples around the store

Supermarkets may spread low price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores and a long way from the entrance - shoppers have to pass tempting, higher-profit lines on the way. In similar vein, chainstores may locate the products they have a good reputation for as far away from the store entrance as possible. They can rely on a degree of customer loyalty towards these products, so they gamble that shoppers will go actively looking for them around the store, passing other wares that might tempt them.

D. Less sells more

Chainstores have transformed the presentation of their wares in recent years. Much of the pioneering work has been done by the Next chain, which turned away from the 'pile them high, sell them cheap' approach to popular fashion. Next stores have a 'boutique' appeal - they're noted for displaying limited fashion-wear on the shelves, giving the impression that the merchandise is exclusive. Of course, Next's clothing is not less mass-produced than that of their rivals - the company's success is as much a testament to good store design as it is to well-designed clothing.

E. Tempting totals

Food shoppers, it seems, are more responsive to the overall size of their weekly or fortnightly bill than to the prices of individual items. Supermarkets take advantage of this by stocking a mix of low mark-up staples and high mark-up items, so it shouldn't be assumed everything that a supermarket sells is cheap. Low prices are of direct appeal to the thrifty shopper.
It's often said that supermarkets deliberately lose money on certain staples to draw shoppers in - known as 'loss leaders'. More commonly, their low prices are achieved by buying in huge quantities from manufacturers, by offering them a prominent place to display their products or by exceeding sales targets - all of which attract big discounts from the manufacturers.

F. The all-important price-tag

Shoppers tend to buy fewer items in chainstores and may be more aware of individual pricing as a result. So the importance of pricing, say, a blouse at PS14.99 as opposed to PS15, still holds. (It's also a useful device, apparently, to reduce theft among the shop's own staff, who are obliged to ring up a sale in order to give the penny change.)

G. Lighting to effect

Both supermarkets and chainstores give careful thought to lighting. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible so that shoppers get a fair idea of what the colour of the clothes will be like in daylight. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.

H. Walk this way

Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'. It's not always successful - some shoppers are reluctant to stray off the routes into the sales areas. Marks and Spencer for example, use wood or marble covering for routes, encouraging shoppers to walk on to the more welcoming carpet in sales areas.

I. In-store promotion

As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you - irresistible if you've had nothing to eat before setting out on your shopping trip. In the United States, 'video trolleys' are being tried out in a number of supermarkets. Each trolley has a screen which advertises products as you shop. Sensors at the end of shelves trigger relevant advertising - so the shopper passing the cook-chill cabinets, say, may receive an ad on the screen for ready-made moussaka. Such trolleys are aimed unashamedly at the impulse shopper, and the makers claim they increase sales by around 30 per cent.",C1,"Shops want you to buy more. They use many ways to make you spend money. For example, they put fresh fruit and plants at the door. They make the store smell like fresh bread. They put expensive things where you can see them easily. They spread cheap things like bread far away so you walk past other items. Some stores show only a few clothes to make them look special. Shoppers think about the total cost, not each price. Shops use low prices on some things to get you in. Prices like PS14.99 seem cheaper than PS15. Lights in stores make food and clothes look good. Stores have paths to guide you. They show big pictures of food to make you hungry. In some stores, shopping carts have screens that show ads.","When you go shopping, stores use tricks to make you buy more than you planned. They create a fresh image by placing fruits and vegetables at the entrance and using smells from bakeries. Products are positioned in key spots, like at eye level, to increase sales. Supermarkets spread staple items like bread around the store so you pass other tempting products. Some stores display fewer items to make them seem exclusive. Shoppers often focus on their total bill, so stores mix low and high-priced goods. Loss leaders are items sold cheaply to attract customers. Pricing items just under a whole number, like PS14.99, encourages purchases. Lighting is used to enhance food and clothing appearances. Stores design paths with different floorings to guide shoppers. Promotions include large food images and video carts that show ads as you shop.","Stores employ various strategies to encourage customers to spend more money. To project an image of freshness, supermarkets place produce and plants near entrances and use bakery smells. They carefully position products, with high-margin or fast-selling items in high-traffic areas, and use eye-level shelves for better visibility. Staples like bread are located far from entrances, forcing shoppers to pass more profitable items. Some retailers, such as Next, limit displays to create an exclusive feel, even though products are mass-produced. Shoppers are often more sensitive to overall costs than individual prices, so stores balance low and high-margin goods. Techniques include loss leaders and psychological pricing, like setting prices just below a round number. Lighting is optimized to show products accurately, and store layouts guide movement with designated pathways. In-store promotions feature appealing images and interactive trolleys that display targeted advertisements.","Retailers utilize sophisticated methods to maximize consumer spending by manipulating store environments and product placements. To convey freshness, supermarkets position fresh produce and aromatic bakeries at entrances, employing colors like green to reinforce this image. Product placement is strategically managed using data analytics to highlight high-margin or rapid-selling items in prime locations, with eye-level shelves being particularly coveted. Staples are dispersed throughout stores to ensure exposure to more lucrative products, while certain chains enhance exclusivity by limiting merchandise displays. Consumer behavior is leveraged through a mix of staple and premium pricing, with loss leaders and bulk purchasing discounts driving perceived value. Psychological pricing tactics, such as charm pricing, are employed to influence purchases. Lighting and store design, including pathway differentiation, are meticulously planned to enhance product appeal and guide shopper flow. Advanced promotions, like video trolleys with sensor-triggered ads, target impulse buying effectively.","Talking shop

Ever entered a store and come away with more than you intended to buy? We reveal the selling devices shops use that are designed to make you spend, spend, spend.

A. The image of freshness 

Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They may place their fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale, to enhance this. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store. The colour of the store's fixtures may heighten the image, too - for example, green may be used because of its association with fresh produce. The bulk of what supermarkets sell -
pre-packaged grocery items such as frozen foods and washing powders - may be quite different from this image.

B. Displaying to advantage

The location of products in the store is considered all-important in determining how well a particular brand sells. Nowhere is this more developed than in supermarkets. With computerised stock-control, supermarkets can find out the parts of the store from which shoppers will select items most often. In these areas can be found products with the highest mark-ups or ones which, though less profitable, sell very quickly. 
Traditionally in retailing, 'eye-level means 'buy-level' -- shelves at eye height are eagerly sought by manufacturers, or may be reserved for certain own-brand items. 'Dump bins' containing special offers tempt those who find it hard to resist a bargain.
Increasingly popular is 'complementation' - placing dessert or salad dressings, say, over units containing ice-creams or items that may be eaten with salads such as burgers.

C. Spreading staples around the store

Supermarkets may spread low price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores and a long way from the entrance - shoppers have to pass tempting, higher-profit lines on the way. In similar vein, chainstores may locate the products they have a good reputation for as far away from the store entrance as possible. They can rely on a degree of customer loyalty towards these products, so they gamble that shoppers will go actively looking for them around the store, passing other wares that might tempt them.

D. Less sells more

Chainstores have transformed the presentation of their wares in recent years. Much of the pioneering work has been done by the Next chain, which turned away from the 'pile them high, sell them cheap' approach to popular fashion. Next stores have a 'boutique' appeal - they're noted for displaying limited fashion-wear on the shelves, giving the impression that the merchandise is exclusive. Of course, Next's clothing is not less mass-produced than that of their rivals - the company's success is as much a testament to good store design as it is to well-designed clothing.

E. Tempting totals

Food shoppers, it seems, are more responsive to the overall size of their weekly or fortnightly bill than to the prices of individual items. Supermarkets take advantage of this by stocking a mix of low mark-up staples and high mark-up items, so it shouldn't be assumed everything that a supermarket sells is cheap. Low prices are of direct appeal to the thrifty shopper.
It's often said that supermarkets deliberately lose money on certain staples to draw shoppers in - known as 'loss leaders'. More commonly, their low prices are achieved by buying in huge quantities from manufacturers, by offering them a prominent place to display their products or by exceeding sales targets - all of which attract big discounts from the manufacturers.

F. The all-important price-tag

Shoppers tend to buy fewer items in chainstores and may be more aware of individual pricing as a result. So the importance of pricing, say, a blouse at PS14.99 as opposed to PS15, still holds.

Such trolleys are aimed unashamedly at the impulse shopper, and the makers claim they increase sales by around 30 per cent.","Retail establishments deploy an array of meticulously engineered techniques to augment consumer expenditure, capitalizing on psychological and environmental factors. To cultivate an aura of freshness, supermarkets situate perishables and flora at ingress points, complemented by olfactory stimuli from in-store bakeries and chromatic schemes that evoke natural associations. Merchandise positioning is paramount, with computerized analytics identifying high-traffic zones for premium-margin or high-velocity items, while manufacturers vie for eye-level shelf space to optimize visibility. The strategic dispersion of low-cost staples throughout the premises compels patrons to traverse aisles replete with higher-profit alternatives, and retailers like Next eschew volume displays in favor of boutique aesthetics that imply exclusivity, notwithstanding mass production. Pricing strategies encompass a blend of loss leaders and manufacturer discounts, predicated on consumers' heightened sensitivity to aggregate costs over individual item prices. Psychological pricing nuances, such as just-below pricing, are employed to subtly influence purchasing decisions. Illumination is calibrated to simulate natural light for apparel and accentuate comestibles, while architectural elements like differentiated flooring guide shopper trajectories along predetermined 'Yellow Brick Road' pathways. Promotional endeavors feature visceral imagery and interactive trolleys equipped with contextual advertising, engineered to exploit impulsive buying behaviors and substantially elevate sales metrics."
199,"From here to paternity

A. The theatre director

Because of my bizarre personal life, which I cannot be proud of, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about.
I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become a friend rather than a father.
I don't believe in physical violence. I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me. As soon as you start chasing them to ask why they have not been in touch, you impose this terrible burden of guilt. My parents did it to me and I would never do it to my children.

B. The advertising executive 

I was young when they were born, only around 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite irksome. It aged me quickly, but at the same time it kept me young, which is something I have always valued. 
As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I could have drifted away from: music, youth culture, clothes. In a funny way that has been invaluable as far as running the agency has been concerned. I have never felt out of touch. 
Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.
They get on well with a lot of our friends and they come to parties with us and advertising awards ceremonies without feeling intimidated. I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting.

C. The politician

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected onto the Greater London Council, and the others followed in quite quick succession. My wife and I vowed that we would carve out time for them but since I have become more and more politically active, time has become a real problem. 
I make it a condition that I will only accept weekend meetings and public appearances where there are facilities for one or more of the kids to come with me. If I did not they would just get squeezed out. This way they have a sense of what I do when I am not with them and there is no feeling of Daddy disappearing.
I've noticed more and more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more conscious of the need to involve our children in our lives.

D. The writer

My first marriage broke up when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I was forced to examine the whole area of fatherhood more closely than I might otherwise have done. I made enormous efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even experimented with living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wished, but I think Kate and Bonnie would say now that they found that quite confusing.
Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. It is true I was around a lot, but, like a lot of Seventies parents, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining only the other day that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more systems, more order. Instead I took this very loose approach. I regret that now.
I still worry about my elder daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way your kids never leave you.

E. The TV presenter

I was ready for kids. I'd hit 30, met my wife, we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why carry on going to the shops every Saturday spending our money on new sofas, when we could have a kid instead?""
Having my daughter Betty has forced me to come to terms with who I am and what I am. You feel you are doing something very special when you conceive a child, and you are. But you are also becoming just one more parent in a great long line of parents. It's a great leveller.
I do resent it occasionally but if ever there is a moment of irritation, it is dispelled by just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest self-preservation mechanism in the world. It can melt a grown man.",C1,"A. The theatre director: I have a strange life. I have had small children for 35 years. I love it. I fed the baby today. That is what a father does. I am lucky. My children and I like the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. This makes us close. Now they are big, I am a friend. I do not hit my children. I have hit them when I was angry, but I do not think it is good. I try to be there for them. They call me if they need me. I do not ask why they do not call. That makes them feel bad. My parents did that to me. I will not do it to my children.

B. The advertising executive: I was young when my children were born. I was 25. I did not like the work and limits. It made me old but also young. When they were teenagers, they showed me music and clothes. This helped me in my job. I never felt old. I was busy with work when they were young. I missed their first concerts and sports days. I am sad, but now I take them on holiday to France. They like our friends. They come to our parties and work events. They are not scared. My job is fun for them.

C. The politician: My first child was born when I started my job. Then I had more children fast. My wife and I said we would have time for them. But I am very busy with work. I only go to work on weekends if my children can come. This way, they know what I do. They do not feel I am gone. I see other politicians bring their children to work. Maybe we all want our children in our lives.

D. The writer: My first marriage ended when my children were young. I thought a lot about being a father. I tried hard to see my children. My ex-wife and I lived next to each other for a time. The children could go between houses. But I think it confused them. My daughter says I was always there. But I was not a good father. I was there, but I treated them like adults too soon. I was too free. I should have had more rules. I regret that. I still worry about all my children. Your children are always with you.

E. The TV presenter: I was ready for children. I was 30. I had a wife and a nice house. We thought, why buy new things when we can have a child? Having my daughter made me understand myself. Making a child is special. But you are just another parent. It makes everyone the same. Sometimes I get angry, but when I see her smile, I am happy. A baby's smile can make a man feel good.","A. The theatre director: Because of my unusual life, I have had small children for 35 years, and I have loved every minute. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me.

C. The politician: My first child was born just before I was elected to the Greater London Council, and I had more children quickly. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more active in politics, time became a problem. I only accept weekend meetings if my children can come with me. This way, they understand my work and do not feel I disappear. I see more politicians bringing their children to the House of Commons. Perhaps we are all realizing the importance of including children in our lives.

D. The writer: My first marriage ended when my daughters were young, so I had to think carefully about being a father. I worked hard to stay in touch with them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, so the children could move freely, but I think they found it confusing. My daughter Kate says I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was present, but like many parents in the 1970s, I treated them as adults too early. Kate recently said we were too liberal. I should have had more rules and order. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest.

E. The TV presenter: I was ready for children when I turned 30, met my wife, and had a nice house. We thought, why spend money on new furniture when we could have a child? Having my daughter Betty made me accept who I am. Creating a child feels special, but it also makes you just one parent among many. It is a great equalizer. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but one look at her smile removes that feeling. A baby's smile is the best way to make an adult feel happy.","A. The theatre director: Due to my unusual personal life, I have had the joy of small children for 35 years, and I can honestly say I have loved every moment. Feeding the baby this morning is an example of what fatherhood means to me. I am very fortunate with my children, as we share interests in opera, theatre, books, and music, which strengthens our bond, especially now that they are mostly adults and I am more of a friend than a father. I do not support physical violence; although I have slapped my children in anger, I do not approve of it. I may not have been deeply attentive, but I have always tried to be available when they need me, on the condition that they contact me first. I avoid chasing them about not being in touch because it imposes guilt, something my parents did to me that I would never repeat.

B. The advertising executive: I was young, around 25, when my children were born, and I admit the responsibilities and limitations were quite irritating. It aged me quickly but also kept me youthful, which I have always appreciated. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which has been invaluable for running my advertising agency and keeping me in touch. Because I was building my business when they were young, I missed events like first concerts and sports days, which I regret, but now I enjoy compensations such as taking them on holidays to southern France. They get along well with our friends and attend parties and advertising awards without feeling intimidated, benefiting from my glamorous and interesting job.

C. The politician: My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others followed rapidly. My wife and I committed to making time for them, but as my political activity increased, time became scarce. I insist that I only attend weekend meetings and appearances if my children can accompany me, so they are not excluded and gain insight into my work without feeling I have disappeared. I have noticed more Members of Parliament bringing their children to the House of Commons, indicating a growing awareness of involving children in our lives.

D. The writer: My first marriage ended when my daughters were young, forcing me to examine fatherhood closely. I made great efforts to maintain contact, and my ex-wife and I even lived adjacent for a time to allow the children free movement, though I believe they found it confusing. Kate has stated in interviews that I was always available, but I doubt I was a very good father. I was present often, but like many parents in the 1970s, I treated them as adults too soon, and Kate has complained about our liberal approach. I regret not introducing more structure and order. I still worry about my older daughters as much as my youngest, showing that children never truly leave you.

E. The TV presenter: I was prepared for children by age 30, with a wife and a lovely home, so we decided to have a child instead of spending on luxuries. Having my daughter Betty has helped me accept my identity; conceiving a child feels special, but it also places you in a long line of parents, acting as a great leveler. Occasionally, I feel resentful, but any irritation vanishes with one look at her smile, which is a powerful self-preservation mechanism that can soften any adult.","A. The theatre director: Owing to my peculiar personal circumstances, I have been blessed with 35 years of raising young children, and I can truthfully affirm that I have cherished every minute. This morning, I had the pleasure of feeding the infant, which epitomizes the essence of fatherhood for me. I consider myself exceedingly fortunate with my offspring, as we share passions for opera, theatre, literature, and music, fostering a profound connection, particularly now that they are largely grown and I function more as a companion than a paternal figure. I reject physical violence; despite having slapped my children in fits of anger, I do not condone such behavior. While I may not have been exceptionally attentive, I have consistently endeavored to be accessible, contingent upon them initiating contact. I refrain from pursuing them about lack of communication to avoid burdening them with guilt, a practice my parents imposed on me that I would never replicate.

B. The advertising executive: I was relatively young, approximately 25, at the time of my children's births, and I confess that the duties and constraints were rather vexing. It accelerated my aging process yet simultaneously preserved my youthfulness, a duality I have always valued. During their adolescent years, they acquainted me with music, youth culture, and apparel, which proved immensely beneficial for managing my advertising agency and ensuring I remained current. As I was striving to establish my enterprise during their early years, I forfeited occasions such as inaugural concerts and athletic events, a source of sorrow, though I now find recompense in activities like escorting them on vacations to the French Riviera. They interact amiably with numerous associates and participate in social gatherings and industry ceremonies without apprehension, deriving advantage from my profession's perceived allure and fascination.

C. The politician: My initial child arrived precisely as I was on the verge of election to the Greater London Council, with subsequent offspring following in rapid succession. My spouse and I resolved to carve out temporal allocations for them, but as my political engagements intensified, temporal resources became genuinely problematic. I stipulate that I will solely acquiesce to weekend engagements and public functions if provisions exist for one or more children to accompany me, thereby preventing their exclusion and affording them comprehension of my endeavors absent any sensation of paternal disappearance. I have observed an increasing number of MPs introducing their children to the House of Commons, possibly reflecting a heightened consciousness regarding the integration of progeny into our existences.

D. The writer: The dissolution of my first marriage occurred when my daughters were quite youthful, compelling me to scrutinize the domain of paternity more meticulously than I might have otherwise. I exerted substantial efforts to sustain rapport with the children; my former wife and I even experimented with residing in adjacent dwellings temporarily to facilitate their unrestricted movement, though I surmise they perceived this arrangement as somewhat perplexing. Kate has articulated in interviews that I was perpetually present for her, yet I am uncertain of my efficacy as a father. It is veracious that I was frequently available, but, akin to numerous parents of the Seventies, I believe I prematurely regarded them as adults. Kate recently lamented our excessive permissiveness; I contemplate that I ought to have instituted more systematic frameworks and discipline. I currently rue that lax methodology. I persist in agonizing over my elder daughters to the same extent as my youngest, illustrating that offspring never genuinely depart from one's concerns.

E. The TV presenter: I had attained readiness for progeny by the age of 30, having encountered my wife and acquired an agreeable residence, thus we deliberated, 'Why persist in expenditive Saturday shopping excursions for furnishings when we could nurture a child instead?' The advent of my daughter Betty has necessitated my reconciliation with self-identity; the act of procreation feels extraordinarily distinctive, yet it simultaneously assimilates one into an extensive lineage of parents, serving as a formidable equalizer. Intermittently, I experience resentment, but any transient vexation is invariably dispelled by a solitary gaze upon her countenance. An infant's smile constitutes the paramount self-preservation mechanism globally, capable of mollifying any mature individual.","From here to paternity

The theatre director: As a consequence of my idiosyncratic personal trajectory, which I cannot regard with pride, I have been endowed with thirty-five years of nurturing young progeny, and I can avow with sincerity that I have relished every instant. This morning, I derived gratification from feeding the neonate, an act that for me encapsulates the quintessence of paternal devotion. I am profoundly fortunate in relation to my children; we are united by mutual affinities for opera, theatrical arts, belles-lettres, and musical compositions, which engenders an indelible bond, particularly now that they have predominantly attained maturity and I have transitioned into a role more akin to a confidant than a patriarch. I eschew physical coercion; although I have been culpable of striking my offspring in moments of ire, I do not sanction such conduct. I may not have exemplified profound attentiveness, but I have perpetually striven to be accessible, predicated on their initiation of communication. I abstain from importuning them regarding infrequent contact to circumvent imposing an onerous burden of culpability, a tactic my progenitors employed against me that I would never perpetrate upon my descendants.

B. The advertising executive: I was in the incipiency of adulthood, merely circa twenty-five years of age, at the nascence of my children, and I concede that the concomitant responsibilities and limitations proved rather irksome. It precipitated a rapid maturation yet concomitantly preserved a vestige of juvenility, a paradox I have invariably esteemed. As they evolved into adolescence, they initiated me into realms from which I might have diverged: musical genres, youth subcultures, and sartorial trends. This has been inestimably advantageous with respect to administering the agency, ensuring I never succumb to obsolescence. Owing to my endeavors to solidify the enterprise during their formative years, I forfeited seminal events such as inaugural concerts and scholastic athletic competitions, a matter of regret, though I now discern compensations in capacities like conducting them on sojourns to the Côte d'Azur. They consort amiably with a plethora of our acquaintances and accompany us to convivial gatherings and advertising accolades sans any sense of intimidation, benefiting from the perception of my vocation as both glamorous and intriguing.

C. The politician: My primogeniture was born contemporaneously with my imminent election to the Greater London Council, and subsequent issue followed in swift succession. My consort and I pledged to delineate temporal allocations for them, but as my political activism burgeoned, chronology became a veritable quandary. I impose as a precondition that I will only countenance weekend convocations and public engagements where infrastructure exists for one or more progeny to accompany me, thereby precluding their marginalization and affording them cognizance of my activities during absences, eliminating any sensation of paternal evaporation. I have discerned an escalating propensity among Members of Parliament to introduce their offspring to the House of Commons, potentially indicative of a burgeoning cognizance of the imperative to incorporate children into our quotidian existences.

D. The writer: The dissolution of my initial matrimony transpired when Kate and Bonnie were in their tender years, coercing me to interrogate the entire sphere of paternity with greater assiduity than might otherwise have been the case. I exerted Herculean efforts to maintain connectivity with the children; my former spouse and I even embarked on an experiment of cohabiting in adjacent residences for a duration, to permit their unfettered transit, though I conjecture that Kate and Bonnie would now aver they found this arrangement somewhat disorienting. Kate has proffered in interviews that I was perpetually available for her, yet I am dubious regarding my proficiency as a paternal figure. It is veritable that I was frequently present, but, analogous to many parents of the 1970s, I surmise I accorded them adult status prematurely. Kate recently remonstrated about our excessive liberalism; I contemplate that I could have instituted more regimented systems and order. Instead, I adopted a notably laissez-faire methodology, a decision I now rue. I persist in harboring anxieties about my elder daughters to the same degree as my youngest, exemplifying that progeny never authentically egress from one's psyche.

E. The TV presenter: I had achieved preparedness for offspring upon reaching my third decade, having encountered my wife and secured an agreeable domicile, thus we cogitated, 'Why perpetuate hebdomadal mercantile excursions expenditive of resources on novel upholstery when we could engender a scion instead?' The advent of my daughter Betty has compelled my acquiescence to self-identity; the process of conception imbues one with a sense of performing an extraordinary feat, which it indeed is, yet it also assimilates one into an extensive genealogy of parents, functioning as a profound egalitarian force. Occasionally, I harbor resentment, but any ephemeral irritation is invariably effaced by a solitary ocular engagement with her visage. An infant's smile constitutes the preeminent self-preservation mechanism extant, possessing the capacity to liquefy the resolve of any mature individual."
200,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING

I thought everyone would be pleased, but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. 'What do you mean?' she raged. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?'
I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day, life-long smoker, and four hours later I was not, was faintly irritating. I find it curious myself.
The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago.
I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. For one thing, I wholly resented the remorseless pressure from the anti-smoking mob - and I still do. For another, I had low blood pressure and a long-living and healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and threw off colds more easily, it seemed to me, than friends with consciously healthier lifestyles.
On that unexceptional Thursday afternoon, I had simply gone along to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to give up. 'I shan't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I announced firmly. 'Since my motivation for being here is writing, not stopping, it would not be right to expect your method to work on me.'
I could not have been more reasonable. After all, I positively enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me rather knowingly.
We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wished and most of the afternoon was conducted in a room so smoke-filled that we had to open the windows.
I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others.
I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense. Just as smoking itself had become a challenge in the face of opposition, so the notion of stopping began to feel attractive.
The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world?
In many senses, it was easy. The physical craving, the pangs of desire for nicotine, in just the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two and I experienced them over only four or five days.
The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order.
Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing - and it still is.
I am increasingly coming to the view dat for me smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself.
Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval. All are key moments in which I would have previously smoked cigarettes.",C1,"I stopped smoking. I thought people would be happy. But one friend was very angry. She said, 'Why did you not stop before?' I could not explain why I stopped so fast. It was strange for me. I went to a class to help people stop smoking. I did not want to stop smoking. I liked smoking. It made me happy. I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I did not cough. In the class, we could smoke a lot. The room was full of smoke. But I did not want to smoke. The class made me think. Stopping smoking made me feel strong. It was easy to stop. I only wanted cigarettes for a few days. Work was easy without cigarettes. But at home on weekends, it was hard. I think I smoked when I was bored. I miss cigarettes sometimes. But not a lot. Now, when I eat out or wait for a plane, I do not smoke.","I gave up smoking. I expected everyone to be pleased, but one colleague was very angry. She asked, 'If it was so easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I could not explain how I stopped quickly, and it was a bit annoying. I find it strange myself. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. It happened two months and three weeks ago. I did not plan to stop and did not really want to. I disliked the pressure from anti-smoking people. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I did not cough or feel sick. I went to the session in Birmingham to write about others trying to quit. I said I would not try to stop because it would not be fair. I enjoyed smoking and found it pleasurable. The counsellor looked at me in a knowing way. In the session, we were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted. The room was very smoky. But I did not feel like smoking, and others felt the same. The messages made sense to me. Stopping smoking started to feel like a good challenge. It made me feel powerful. The physical craving for nicotine went away after a minute or two and lasted only a few days. Work was not hard without cigarettes, but being at home on weekends was difficult. I think I smoked to avoid boredom. I miss cigarettes a little, especially in situations like eating out or waiting for a plane, but not too much.","I decided to give up smoking. I thought everyone would be happy about it, but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. She demanded, 'What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?' I found it hard to explain how I changed from being a daily smoker to a non-smoker in just one afternoon, which was somewhat irritating. I still find it curious. The stop-smoking session combined group therapy and hypnotherapy and took place exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had no intention of quitting and did not particularly want to. I resented the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups, and I still do. Additionally, I had low blood pressure and came from a long-living, healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and seemed to recover from colds more easily than healthier friends. On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I attended the Birmingham session of 'The Easy Way to Stop Smoking' to write an article about others trying to quit. I firmly stated that I would not try to stop myself, as it would not be fair since my motivation was writing, not quitting. I believed I was being reasonable because I genuinely enjoyed smoking and found it pleasurable. The counsellor appeared to look at me knowingly. During the session, we were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room became so smoke-filled that we had to open windows. Interestingly, when told to smoke, I was reluctant, as were the others. I think the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense, and the idea of quitting became appealing as a challenge. The possibility of not smoking made me feel powerful in a personal way. The physical cravings for nicotine, similar to hunger pangs, faded quickly and only lasted four or five days. I had thought work would be difficult without cigarettes, but it caused no problems, whereas relaxing at home on weekends proved challenging and still is. I am coming to the view that smoking was a way to displace boredom; having a cigarette was an activity itself. I do miss cigarettes, but not excessively. Each new experience as a non-smoker, such as eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre interval, reminds me of times I would have smoked.","The day I gave up smoking, I anticipated universal approval, but one colleague reacted with fury, exclaiming, 'What do you mean? If it was that effortless, why hadn't you ceased years ago?' My inability to elucidate how I transformed from a lifelong, packet-a-day smoker to a non-smoker within a single afternoon was mildly irritating, and I myself find it perplexing. The cessation session, which occurred precisely two months and three weeks prior, was an intriguing blend of group therapy and hypnotherapy. I had not intended to quit and lacked any strong desire to do so. I deeply resented the relentless pressure from anti-smoking advocates—a sentiment I still hold—and, moreover, I had low blood pressure and a heritage of longevity and robust health, rarely coughing or feeling ill and seemingly fending off colds more effectively than friends with consciously healthier habits. On that unremarkable Thursday afternoon, I attended the Birmingham session of 'The Easy Way to Stop Smoking' solely to author an article about others attempting to quit, firmly declaring that I would not partake in cessation efforts as it would be unfair, given my motivation was journalistic rather than personal. I considered myself entirely reasonable, as I derived genuine pleasure from smoking, yet the counsellor regarded me with a knowing expression. Participants were permitted to smoke liberally, resulting in a smoke-filled room that necessitated open windows, but I noted with interest my own reluctance to smoke, a sentiment shared by others. I surmise that the anti-smoking rhetoric resonated intellectually, and just as smoking had become a defiance against opposition, the notion of quitting grew appealing. The prospect of being a non-smoker imbued me with a sense of personal power, a private sentiment unrelated to others. The physical nicotine cravings, akin to hunger pangs, dissipated within minutes and persisted for merely four or five days. Contrary to expectations, my work—which I had presumed would be insurmountable without cigarettes—presented no difficulties, whereas leisurely activities at home on weekends proved and continue to be the most challenging. I am increasingly convinced that smoking served primarily to alleviate boredom; the act of smoking was an engagement in itself. While I do miss cigarettes, it is not profoundly; each novel experience as a non-smoker, such as dining out, awaiting a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre intermission, constitutes a pivotal moment that previously would have involved smoking.","THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING

The cessation session, an amalgam of group therapy and hypnotherapy, transpired exactly two months and three weeks ago. I had no design to desist and did not particularly aspire to; I wholly resented the remorseless pressure from anti-smoking factions—a resentment I perpetuate—and, furthermore, I possessed low blood pressure and a lineage characterised by longevity and salubrity, neither coughing nor feeling indisposed and, it seemed, repelling colds more adeptly than acquaintances with deliberately healthier lifestyles. On that unexceptional Thursday afternoon, I merely attended the Birmingham session of 'The Easy Way to Stop Smoking' to compose an article about others endeavouring to quit, asserting resolutely that I would not attempt cessation myself, deeming it inequitable as my impetus was literary, not personal. I could not have been more reasonable, for I positively savoured smoking, deriving authentic pleasure therefrom, though the counsellor regarded me with a perceptive air. We were encouraged to smoke ad libitum, and the majority of the afternoon unfolded in a chamber so permeated with smoke that we were compelled to open the windows. I observed with interest that when instructed to smoke, I was disinclined, as were my counterparts. I conjecture that the anti-smoking tenets made intellectual sense; analogous to how smoking had become a challenge in the face of opposition, the concept of cessation began to seem enticing. The potentiality of non-smoker status commenced evoking a sense of potency, a clandestine sentiment pertaining solely to myself. The physical craving for nicotine, pangs analogous to hunger, abated after a minute or two and I experienced them for only four or five days. The one activity—my vocation—that I had envisaged would be most arduous to execute sans cigarettes occasioned not a single impediment, whereas puttering about at home on weekend mornings proved, and persists as, the most formidable aspect. I am progressively adopting the perspective that, for me, smoking was substantially concerned with displacing ennui; the act of having a cigarette constituted an activity per se. Indeed, I do miss my cigarettes, though not excessively; each 'novel' experience as a non-smoker must be confronted—dining out, awaiting an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval—all being pivotal junctures wherein I would previously have indulged in smoking."
201,"Tapping into a food supply

In the forests of Madagascar there lives a primate with a lifestyle remarkably like a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the primate, the rare and elusive aye-aye, bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae. The woodpecker, of course, uses its beak for chiselling into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey; the aye-aye, on the other hand, uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Though the aye-aye's strange way of feeding was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only now discovered how it locates the insects hidden inside the wood.
Dr Carl Erickson, of Duke University's Primate Center, has been investigating the hunting skills of two captive males, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her infant daughter, Annabelle (Animal Behaviour, vol. 41 pp. 793-802). He first tested whether they found insects just by looking for the telltale visual signs of their presence. For example, holes on the surface might indicate sites where female insects had entered the wood and laid their eggs. Dr Erickson presented the aye-ayes with logs in which he had drilled several narrow holes. Some holes led to cavities containing mealworms while others were blank dead-ends. The aye-ayes went straight for the cavities with food, gnawing through the wood and clearly not requiring the visual clues of surface holes.
Perhaps the aye-ayes were locating the mealworms by their smell or the sounds they were making. But further tests showed that they didn't use these clues either. Logs in which the smell of the insects was prevented from leaking out presented no problem, and the aye-ayes also located dead (and therefore silent) mealworms.
If they weren't seeing, smelling or hearing the insects, how were the aye-ayes able to find them? Dr Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those containing mealworms. They could apparently sense the cavity itself.
When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. Dr Erickson suggests that the animal is echo-locating, listening and perhaps feeling for reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.
The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are birds, such as the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, which do probe for or glean insects from wood, and so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant. Not only can the aye-aye be regarded as a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat rolled into one, but it also behaves like a squirrel (indeed, it was originally classified as one). Its incisors grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has recently been observed in the wild gnawing through the shells of nuts, and extracting the meat of the nut with its elongated finger.",C1,"In Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives in forests. It looks for food like insects in wood. It uses its teeth to make holes. It uses its long finger to get the insects out. Scientists studied the aye-aye. They found it does not use its eyes, nose, or ears to find the insects. Instead, it taps on the wood with its finger. It listens for sounds. This helps it find hollow spaces with insects. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker bird. But in Madagascar, there are no woodpeckers. The aye-aye also eats nuts like a squirrel.","In the forests of Madagascar, there is a rare animal named the aye-aye. It has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. The aye-aye chews holes in wood with its teeth and uses its long third finger to pull out insect larvae. Scientists, including Dr. Carl Erickson, studied captive aye-ayes. They discovered that the aye-ayes do not use sight, smell, or sound to locate the insects. Instead, they tap on the wood with their finger and listen with their big ears to find hollow spaces where insects are hiding. This is called echo-location. The aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar, where woodpeckers are not found. It also eats nuts, using its teeth and finger like a squirrel.","In Madagascar's forests, the aye-aye is a primate that behaves much like a woodpecker. Both animals drill into wood to find insect larvae, but the aye-aye uses its teeth to gnaw holes and its elongated third finger to probe for food. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University researched how aye-ayes locate insects. His experiments showed that they do not rely on visual cues, smell, or sound. Instead, they tap on the wood surface with their middle finger and use their large ears to detect echoes, which reveal hollow cavities containing insects. This echo-location method helps them find prey. Although the aye-aye is often compared to woodpeckers, some birds in Madagascar also search for insects in wood. Additionally, the aye-aye shares traits with squirrels, such as continuously growing teeth and the ability to crack open nuts with its finger.","In the forests of Madagascar, the elusive aye-aye primate exhibits a foraging behavior analogous to that of woodpeckers. Both species bore into wood to access insect larvae; however, the aye-aye employs its incisor teeth for gnawing and its slender third digit for extraction. Dr. Carl Erickson of Duke University's Primate Center conducted studies on captive aye-ayes to elucidate their hunting techniques. His research demonstrated that they do not depend on visual indicators, olfactory signals, or auditory cues from the insects. Rather, they utilize a form of echo-location by tapping the wood with their middle finger and attentively listening with their prominent ears to discern subsurface cavities. This ability allows them to detect both hollow spaces and any movement of insects. While the aye-aye is thought to occupy the ecological niche of woodpeckers in Madagascar, other avian species also engage in similar insect-probing behaviors. Furthermore, the aye-aye resembles squirrels in certain aspects, such as perpetually growing incisors and utilizing its elongated finger to extract nut meats.","Tapping into a food supply

Both entities excavate timber to procure insect larvae; the woodpecker leverages its beak and protracted tongue, whereas the aye-aye utilizes its incisors to gnaw apertures and its attenuated third digit to probe and extricate prey. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University's Primate Center meticulously investigated the predatory proficiencies of captive aye-ayes, ascertaining that they eschew visual, olfactory, and auditory cues in target localization. Instead, they engage in percussive foraging, tapping the substrate with their medial finger while orienting their hypertrophied pinnae to capture acoustic reverberations, thereby echolocating subterranean voids and potential insect agitation. This sophisticated sensory adaptation enables precise cavity detection. The conjecture that the aye-aye supplants woodpeckers in their absence is compelling, yet it is nuanced by the presence of other avifauna like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that similarly glean insects from wood. Moreover, the aye-aye's behavioral and morphological parallels with squirrels—including ceaselessly growing incisors and adept nut-shell penetration facilitated by its specialized digit—underscore its ecological versatility."

CHARLES SPENCER

A. Tamburlaine the Great

Marlowe's ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending, but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands' staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe's play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. Antony Sher is in terrific form in the title role, somersaulting from the balcony, sliding down a rope head-first as he delivers a speech, demanding and getting the audience's complete attention as his eyes glint with a mad lust for power and glory. Great stuff.
Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (01789 295623)

B. Women Laughing

Welcome London transfer for the late Michael Wall's fine play, seen at the Manchester Royal Exchange in May. The first act creates an atmosphere of unsettling menace as two married couples chat on a sunny suburban lawn. In the second half the location shifts and the piece becomes a powerful, compassionate study of the devastating effects of illness. The British theatre lost a talent of great promise when Wall died at the tragically early age of 44.
Royal Court Theatre, London SW1 (0207 730 1745)

C. Amphibians

Billy Roche is the latest in the long line of Irish dramatists to have enriched the English stage. All his plays to date have been set in his native Wexford, and this latest piece explores the decline of the fishing industry with his usual mixture of rich characterisation, painful emotion and sudden moments of quirky humour. The play sprawls a bit aimlessly at times, but builds to a blistering climax.
Barbican 3 Pit Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

Traditional thriller involving our old friend, 'the perfect murder'. This time it is Gerald Harper and William Gaunt who play the crime-writing partnership intent on killing each other, and though its all rather familiar stuff; the twists and turns are handled with ingenuity.
Whitehall Theatre, London SW1 (0207 867 1119)

E. The Alchemist

Young director Sam Mendes finds the gold in Jonson's great comedy of 17th-century confidence tricksters. First seen at the Swan in Stratford last year, the show works just as well on the Barbican's main stage, with Jonathan Hyde, David Bradley and Joanne Pearce repeating their fine performances as the wicked trio of con-artists.

G. Dreams from a summer house

This delightful new musical finds playwright Alan Ayckbourn in unusually benign form as he relocates the Beauty and the Beast story deep in the heart of London suburbia. A lush score by John Pattison and an unashamedly schmaltzy celebration of romantic love combine to make this good-hearted show a real winner.

David Thacker's lacklustre production of Shakespeare's most farcical comedy came perilously close to being awarded the dreaded thumbs-down symbol, but this disappointing, crudely designed show is redeemed by first-rate comic performances from Ron Cook as the French physician Dr Caius and Anton Lesser as the explosively jealous husband, Ford.

A. Tamburlaine the Great
Marlowe's ten-act epic concerning the all-conquering warrior Tamburlaine may appear interminable, yet it emerges as one of the year's most thrilling theatrical experiences in Terry Hands' staging. By excising substantial portions of the text, Hands delivers a production that merges the splendours of Marlowe's drama with exhilarating speed and physicality. Antony Sher excels in the titular role, executing somersaults from the balcony and descending head-first down a rope while orating, commanding the audience's undivided attention with his eyes gleaming with a frenzied craving for power and glory.

A. Tamburlaine the Great

Marlowe's ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending, but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands' staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe's play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. Antony Sher is in terrific form in the title role, somersaulting from the balcony, sliding down a rope head-first as he delivers a speech, demanding and getting the audience's complete attention as his eyes glint with a mad lust for power and glory. Great stuff.

A. Tamburlaine the Great
Marlowe's decameral epic delineating the all-vanquishing warrior Tamburlaine might ostensibly seem interminable, yet it materialises as one of the annum's most electrifying nocturnal spectacles in Terry Hands' directorial interpretation. By excising substantial segments from the original text, Hands proffers a production that amalgamates the magnificence of Marlowe's opus with an invigorating celerity and corporeal dynamism. Antony Sher is in prodigious form in the eponymous role, performing gymnastic feats such as somersaulting from the balcony and descending head-first via a rope whilst delivering orations, compelling the audience's rapt attention as his ocular orbs scintillate with a maniacal avidity for puissance and renown.

204,"Life was getting out of hand

Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and rediscovers the joys of manual labour.

Everyone is in love with technology. It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK.
These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment.
However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor -
a PS48 call-out fee, a labour charge of PS15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.
This makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us.
So when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost.
I am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go.
Of course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were becoming too apt to collapse in front of the television, or slot in a video, I sent back the rented colour equipment and we returned to the small black-and-white portable.
It is a real strain on the eyes and concentrates the mind on what is really worth watching. We now spend a lot more time walking the dog (who never liked television anyway), reading, talking or pursuing other hobbies.
One of these, in my own case, is sewing; and here is another gadget that went by the board. My old Singer sewing machine is now an ornamental plant table, and as l cannot afford to replace it, I have taken to sewing by hand.
We have come to believe that we could not do without it, and if we do resist the notion that our lives would be unmanageable without the appliances of science we certainly do not want to relinquish them. Pity the generations whose lives were blighted by tedious and blister inducing toil. Even our brains are relieved of exertion by computers that not only perform miraculous calculations with amazing speed but now provide entertainment.
In fact, the time I now spend placidly stitching is anything but tedious, and the advantages are numerous. For a start, I can sew and listen to the radio - another rediscovered pleasure - or I can talk with family and friends. If it is a simple task, I can watch the programmes I do want to see on television, and alleviate my puritanical guilt at sitting in front of the box by doing something useful at the same time. And what a lovely, cosy feeling it is to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea for company.
Quite wrongly, I had tended to think with horror of the women who sewed elaborate garments, robes, linen and household items by hand. I thought of those long hours, the strain on the eyes and so on. 
There is a wonderfully soothing quality about executing a craft by hand, a great satisfaction in watching one's work become neater, more assured. I find things get done surprisingly quickly, and the pace of life suddenly slows down to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also freed from one of the most detestable aspects of late 20th century life the need to rush to finish an activity so that I can rush to the next.
Meanwhile I have regained control of my sink, where I plunge my hands into the suds and daydream while doing the washing up agreeable, if temporarily forgotten, activity.
The result of all this brooding is that I now prowl the house with a speculative eye. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave oven, that powered lawnmower? Come to think of it, we could save an awful lot of money by doing without electric lights!",C1,"Life was too busy. Susan Harr stops using her machines. She finds joy in working with her hands. Everyone loves technology. It gives us machines that make life easy and give us more time. But a slow idea tells us technology is best. This is clear. Using my hands does not use power. Hand work does not make the air dirty. My word machine broke. It cost a lot to fix. This made me think machines are not worth the money. Are we too dependent on technology? I let my home machines break and did not fix them. What time does technology give us? Time to do more things and buy more machines? If yes, the sellers are tricking us. My machine made strange sounds. A repair person could not fix it. I put it outside. Now I sew by hand. I am not tied to a loud machine. I can take my time. I can take my sewing with me. Some machines I still want. I learned I need a washing machine. But losing other machines made me happy. We watched too much TV. I sent back the big TV. Now we have a small black and white TV. It is hard to see, so we watch only good shows. We now walk the dog, read, talk, and do hobbies more. I sew by hand. My old sewing machine is now a table. I cannot buy a new one. We think we need machines. We do not want to give them up. But hand sewing is not boring. I can sew and listen to the radio or talk. I can sew and watch TV. It feels nice to sew by the fire with tea. I used to think hand sewing was bad. I thought it took a long time and hurt the eyes. But hand sewing is calm and satisfying. My work gets better. I finish quickly. Life slows down. I do not rush. I also wash dishes by hand. I put my hands in soapy water and dream. Now I look around my house. Do we need the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower? We could save money without electric lights!","Life was becoming too much to handle. Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and finds happiness in manual work. Everyone loves technology. It provides wonderful gadgets that make life easier and give us more free time. A gradual brainwashing has convinced us that technology is in charge and that is fine. The results are obvious. Using my hands does not use electricity. Handcraft does not pollute the environment. Recently, my word processor broke. It cost a lot to repair – a call-out fee, labor charges, and parts. This confirmed my suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the cost or trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we think? Slowly, I have let household gadgets break and not replaced them. I wonder what time technology really gives us. Time to start more activities that require more gadgets? If so, the marketers are deceiving us. When my machine made odd noises and even a repair agent could not fix it, I left it in the backyard. Now I sew by hand. I am not connected to a noisy machine, and I can work slowly on my sewing. Also, I was always scared of electric machines that move fast near my fingers. Best of all, I can put my sewing in a bag and take it anywhere. Of course, some gadgets I still want. After a year without a washing machine, I saw its value. But losing others brought unexpected joy. We were watching too much TV, so I returned the rented color TV and we use a small black-and-white one instead. It strains the eyes, so we only watch what is really good. Now we spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or doing hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I stopped using my sewing machine. My old Singer is now a table for plants, and since I cannot buy a new one, I sew by hand. We believe we cannot live without gadgets and do not want to give them up. But hand sewing is not tedious. I can sew and listen to the radio or talk with others. For simple tasks, I can watch TV and feel less guilty by doing something useful. It is cozy to sew by the fire with tea. I used to think badly of women who sewed by hand, imagining long hours and eye strain. But hand sewing is soothing and satisfying. My skills improve, and things get done fast. Life slows to my own pace, and I do not rush. I also enjoy washing dishes by hand, dreaming in the suds. Now I look around my house and question if we need the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. We could save a lot of money by not using electric lights!","Life was getting out of control. Susan Harr disconnects her gadgets and rediscovers the pleasures of manual labor. Everyone is enamored with technology, which offers marvelous gadgets that simplify life and provide extra time for other activities. A gradual, though not very subtle, form of brainwashing has led us to believe that technology dominates and that this is acceptable. The implications are clear: using my hands consumes no electricity, and handmade crafts do not harm the environment. However, a recent frustrating experience with my malfunctioning word processor – involving a high call-out fee, labor charges per quarter hour, and additional costs for parts – reinforced my suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or hassle. Are we as reliant on technology as we assume? Gradually, I have allowed household technology to fall into disuse as it reaches the end of its short lifespan. This makes me question what 'time' technology actually affords us. Is it time to engage in more activities that require purchasing additional gadgets? If so, credit to the marketing experts, but I believe they are deceiving us. When the device began making strange noises that persisted even after a confused service agent disconnected it, I abandoned it in the backyard. Now, I sew by hand. I am not bound to a noisy, whirring machine; I can work at my own pace on garments. Moreover, I was always uneasy about electric machines that speed towards one's fingers. Best of all, I can pack everything into a bag and take it with me wherever I go. Certainly, there are gadgets I would not want to live without; a year without a washing machine taught me its value. Yet, losing others has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were too inclined to watch television or play videos, I returned the rented color TV, and we reverted to a small black-and-white portable. It strains the eyes and makes us focus on what is truly worth watching. Consequently, we now spend more time walking the dog (who never liked TV), reading, conversing, or pursuing hobbies. In my case, sewing is one such hobby, and I have given up using my sewing machine. My old Singer now serves as a plant stand, and since I cannot afford a replacement, I have taken to sewing manually. We have come to think we cannot manage without technology and are reluctant to give it up, but hand sewing is far from tedious. I can sew while listening to the radio – another rediscovered joy – or talking with family and friends. For simple tasks, I can watch desired TV programs and reduce guilt by being productive simultaneously. It is a lovely, cozy feeling to sew by the fire with a pot of tea. I used to mistakenly view hand sewing with horror, thinking of long hours and eye strain. However, executing a craft by hand is wonderfully soothing and satisfying, as my work becomes neater and more confident. Tasks are completed surprisingly quickly, and life slows to the rhythm of my hands, freeing me from the rush of modern life. I have also regained enjoyment in washing dishes by hand, daydreaming in the suds. As a result, I now scrutinize my home, wondering if we truly need the freezer, microwave oven, or electric lawnmower. In fact, we could save a significant amount of money by forgoing electric lights!","Life was becoming unmanageable. Susan Harr unplugs her electronic devices and rekindles the joys of manual labour. Society is infatuated with technology, which furnishes us with marvellous gadgets that facilitate life and ostensibly grant us additional leisure time. A gradual, albeit not particularly subtle, form of indoctrination has persuaded us that technology reigns supreme and that this is acceptable. The consequences are evident: employing my hands utilises no electrical power, and handicrafts do not contaminate the environment. Nevertheless, a recent disheartening incident with my defective word processor – entailing a substantial call-out fee, labour charges per quarter hour, and costs for parts and replacements – corroborated my suspicion that gadgets frequently are not worth the financial outlay or inconvenience. Are we as dependent on technology as we presume? Incrementally, I have permitted household technology to become obsolete as its naturally brief lifespan concludes. This leads me to ponder what 'time' technology genuinely bestows upon us. Is it time to undertake more pursuits that necessitate acquiring further gadgets? If so, accolades to the marketing specialists, but I contend they are duping us. When the apparatus commenced emitting peculiar noises that persisted even after a perplexed service agent disconnected it, I relegated it to the backyard. Presently, I engage in hand sewing. I am no longer tethered to a clamorous, whirring machine; I can leisurely work on garments. Furthermore, I was perpetually somewhat apprehensive about electric machines that dart across fabric towards one's fingers. Most advantageously, I can consolidate the entire assemblage into a carrier bag and transport it wherever I journey. Admittedly, there are certain gadgets I would prefer not to relinquish; residing without a washing machine for a year convinced me of its utility. However, the absence of others has yielded unforeseen delight. Perceiving that we were becoming too prone to languish before the television or insert a video, I returned the leased colour equipment, and we reverted to a diminutive black-and-white portable. It imposes a genuine strain on the eyes and concentrates the mind on programming that is truly worthwhile. We now devote considerably more time to walking the dog (who never favoured television), reading, conversing, or engaging in other pastimes. One such pastime, in my instance, is sewing; and here is another gadget I have discarded. My antiquated Singer sewing machine now functions as an ornamental plant table, and as I cannot afford a substitute, I have adopted sewing by hand. We have grown to believe that we could not function without technology, and if we do resist the notion that our lives would be chaotic sans scientific appliances, we certainly are disinclined to renounce them. Yet, the time I now spend placidly stitching is anything but tedious, and the benefits are manifold. For instance, I can sew while listening to the radio – another rediscovered pleasure – or interacting with family and friends. If the task is straightforward, I can observe television programmes I genuinely wish to view, mitigating my puritanical guilt at sitting idly before the screen by concurrently performing something productive. Moreover, it is an exceedingly cosy sensation to sit by the fireside and sew with a pot of tea for companionship. Quite erroneously, I had previously regarded with horror the women who manually sewed elaborate garments, robes, linen, and household items, envisaging protracted hours and ocular strain. In reality, there is an immensely soothing quality to executing a craft manually, accompanied by profound satisfaction in witnessing one's work become more meticulous and assured. I discover that tasks are accomplished with surprising celerity, and the tempo of life abruptly decelerates to the cadence of my own hands. I am also emancipated from one of the most detestable facets of late 20th-century existence: the imperative to hasten through one activity to proceed to the next. Concurrently, I have reclaimed dominion over my sink, where I immerse my hands into the suds and daydream whilst performing the washing-up – an agreeable, if temporarily forgotten, pursuit. The culmination of this reflection is that I now patrol my domicile with a speculative gaze. Do we genuinely require the freezer, the microwave oven, that powered lawnmower? Upon consideration, we could conserve a considerable sum of money by eschewing electric illumination!","Life was getting out of hand

Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and rediscovers the joys of manual labour.

Everyone is in love with technology. It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK.
These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment.
However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor -
a PS48 call-out fee, a labour charge of PS15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.
This makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us.
So when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost.
I am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go.
Of course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were becoming too apt to collapse in front of the television, or slot in a video, I sent back the rented colour equipment and we returned to the small black-and-white portable.
It is a real strain on the eyes and concentrates the mind on what is really worth watching. We now spend a lot more time walking the dog (who never liked television anyway), reading, talking or pursuing other hobbies.
One of these, in my own case, is sewing; and here is another gadget that went by the board. My old Singer sewing machine is now an ornamental plant table, and as l cannot afford to replace it, I have taken to sewing by hand.
We have come to believe that we could not do without it, and if we do resist the notion that our lives would be unmanageable without the appliances of science we certainly do not want to relinquish them. Pity the generations whose lives were blighted by tedious and blister inducing toil. Even our brains are relieved of exertion by computers that not only perform miraculous calculations with amazing speed but now provide entertainment.
In fact, the time I now spend placidly stitching is anything but tedious, and the advantages are numerous. For a start, I can sew and listen to the radio - another rediscovered pleasure - or I can talk with family and friends. If it is a simple task, I can watch the programmes I do want to see on television, and alleviate my puritanical guilt at sitting in front of the box by doing something useful at the same time. And what a lovely, cosy feeling it is to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea for company.
Quite wrongly, I had tended to think with horror of the women who sewed elaborate garments, robes, linen and household items by hand. I thought of those long hours, the strain on the eyes and so on. 
There is a wonderfully soothing quality about executing a craft by hand, a great satisfaction in watching one's work become neater, more assured. I find things get done surprisingly quickly, and the pace of life suddenly slows down to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also freed from one of the most detestable aspects of late 20th century life the need to rush to finish an activity so that I can rush to the next.
Meanwhile I have regained control of my sink, where I plunge my hands into the suds and daydream while doing the washing up agreeable, if temporarily forgotten, activity.
The result of all this brooding is that I now prowl the house with a speculative eye. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave oven, that powered lawnmower? Come to think of it, we could save an awful lot of money by doing without electric lights!","Existence was verging on the ungovernable. Susan Harr disengages her electronic apparatus and reacquaints herself with the gratifications of manual toil. The populace is enamoured with technology, which bestows upon us an array of marvellous contrivances that ostensibly streamline existence and bequeath us copious additional temporal resources for alternative pursuits. A gradual, though scarcely subtle, form of cerebral conditioning has inculcated the conviction that technology holds dominion, and that this state of affairs is unobjectionable. The ramifications are manifest: the articulation of my digits expends nought from the erstwhile power supply being voraciously consumed by our insatiable species. A handicraft executed manually does not contaminate the biosphere. However, a recent disquieting episode involving my malfunctioning word processor – comprising a PS48 call-out fee, a labour charge of PS15 per quarter of an hour, augmented by expenditures for components and replacements – has substantiated a suspicion that gadgets are frequently not commensurate with the fiscal outlay or the attendant vexation. Are we as contingent upon technology as we envisage? Incrementally, I have permitted domestic technology to lapse into desuetude as its innate and often abbreviated vitality terminates. This incites me to ruminate upon the precise nature of the 'time' that technology purportedly affords us. Is it temporal latitude to embark upon further enterprises for which we must procure additional gadgets? If such be the case, commendations to the marketing savants: but I opine that they are perpetrating a deception upon us. Ergo, when the mechanism commenced emitting curious acoustics, which persisted even subsequent to its disconnection by a bewildered service technician, I consigned it to the backyard, where it murmurs damply to itself akin to some automaton spectre. I am no longer shackled to a cacophonous, whirring machine, with my cranium inclined and my dorsal aspect averted from the world, and I can deliberate over the vestment at my leisure. In any event, I was perennially somewhat disconcerted by those electric machines that hurtle across the textile towards one's digits. Most felicitously, I can consolidate the entirety into a carrier receptacle and convey it with me peregrinations. Assuredly, there exist certain gadgets I should be loath to forgo; a annum's sojourn sans a washing machine persuaded me of the electric washtub's merit. But there are others whose forfeiture has engendered unanticipated delight. Apprehending that we were becoming overly predisposed to succumb before the television, or insert a video cassette, I repatriated the leased colour apparatus and we reverted to the diminutive black-and-white portable. It imposes a veritable strain upon the ocular faculties and concentrates the intellect upon that which is genuinely worthy of observation. We now expend a preponderance of additional time ambulating the canine (who never evinced any partiality for television), perusing literature, conversing, or pursuing other avocations. One of these, in my own instance, is sartorial construction; and here is another gadget that has been jettisoned. My antiquated Singer sewing machine now serves as an ornamental plant stand, and as I lack the wherewithal to supplant it, I have resorted to manual sewing. We have assimilated the belief that we could not subsist without it, and if we do contest the notion that our lives would be unmanageable absent the appliances of science, we unequivocally do not desire to relinquish them. Yet, the interlude I now devote to placidly plying the needle is far from tedious, and the advantages are multifarious. For a commencement, I can sew whilst auditing the radio – another rekindled pleasure – or I can discourse with kin and comrades. If it is an elementary undertaking, I can observe the programmes I genuinely wish to witness on television, and assuage my puritanical compunction at reclining before the apparatus by simultaneously executing something utilitarian. And what a delectable, snug sensation it is to repose by the hearth and sew with a pot of tea for consort. Quite erroneously, I had previously inclined to contemplate with trepidation the women who manually fabricated elaborate raiment, vestments, linens, and domestic accoutrements. I ruminated upon those protracted hours, the ocular exertion, and so forth. There is an exquisitely soothing attribute about performing a craft manually, a profound contentment in beholding one's labour become more fastidious, more assured. I discern that tasks are accomplished with astonishing alacrity, and the momentum of life abruptly decelerates to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also liberated from one of the most abhorrent aspects of fin de siècle existence: the exigency to expedite one activity so that I might hasten to the subsequent. Meanwhile, I have reasserted command over my sink, wherein I submerge my hands into the sudorific foam and indulge in reverie whilst executing the ablutions – an agreeable, if ephemerally neglected, pursuit. The consequence of all this cogitation is that I now perambulate the residence with a speculative ocular organ. Do we veritably necessitate the freezer, the microwave oven, that motorised lawnmower? Upon reflection, we could economise a prodigious quantity of pecuniary resources by abstaining from electric illumination!"
205,"Ordinary people, ordinary lives

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like, the sort of people they were in their youth? The glimpses rare diaries give us are frustratingly incomplete, family anecdotes only half remembered. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional.
Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies, producing a hardback book of at least 20,000 words -- with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.
The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. 
""When I started I didn't take it nearly so seriously as I do now, having met people who genuinely will talk and have led interesting lives,"" she says. ""They would say they are doing it for their children or for posterity, but they are getting quite a lot out of it themselves. They enjoy doing it.""
The assurance of confidentiality encourages her subjects to overcome any instinct of self-censorship. 
""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost one fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were things that hurt, like my divorce, and the pain was still there.""
""I did it for my family, so that perhaps they could learn something, but I have not yet let my children - who are in their thirties - read it. They were hurt by things in my life and there are a lot of details which I don't feel I want them to know at the moment. If they insist, I'll let them. But I think I'd rather they read it after I was dead.""
He also recognised patterns laid down in childhood, which showed themselves in repeatedly making the same mistakes. It is something Ms Renier has detected in other people. ""It's amazing how many people really have been conditioned by their parents,"" she says. ""The injunctions and encouragements that were laid down in childhood have effects for the rest of their lives. They become caught in repeating patterns of behaviour. They marry the sort of people of whom their parents approved -- or go in the opposite direction as a sort of rebellion.""
""A lot of disappointments come out. Sixty years later they still are regretting or resenting things that were never resolved with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had hang-ups in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They live their lives in an attempt to impress a parent who wasn't impressed and if that fails some of them seem to be seeking permission to say 'I can't stand my mother'.""
Recorder rather than inquisitor, Ms Renier keeps her distance. ""It's not for public consumption and I'm not there as a very nosy person. People have got carried away and told me something, then said, 'I'm not sure if that ought to go in'. I put it in anyway - they can remove things when they see the draft. But generally people want to be honest, warts and all.""
""It's not vanity publishing, it's not people saying 'Gosh, I've had such an interesting life the world's got to know about it.' Things are moving much faster than at any time in history and we are losing sight of what happened in the past. It's a way of giving roots. We need some sort of link to our ancestors because people don't sit around in an extended family any more. People want a little immortality.""
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: choose your own colour of library buckram, pick your own title.
Fascinating to the private audience at which each book is aimed, the results are obviously not of the dirt-at-any-cost school of life story. Ms Renier organises her material logically and writes well, the final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each. She receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost - inevitable with the time involved -- clearly deters many people.
""I thought it would be a more downmarket product than it is,"" she says. ""But the people I've done have all been county types, readers of Harpers & Queen, which is one of the magazines where I advertise. They're the sort of people who at one time would have had their portraits painted to leave to their descendants.""",C1,"Most people have photos of their grandparents.

People enjoy telling their stories. They want their children to learn from them. Sometimes, they talk about sad things, like divorce. They see patterns from their childhood that repeat in their lives. Hannah listens and writes everything. The books are private and help people feel connected to their past. Each book takes many hours to make and costs nearly £3,000. Many people are interested, but the price is high.","Most people possess photographs of their grandparents, yet they know little about their actual lives or personalities in their youth. Diaries and family stories provide only incomplete insights. Similarly, we often intend to record our own experiences for future generations but fail to do so. Hannah Renier addresses this by writing autobiographies for ordinary individuals, producing illustrated books of at least 20,000 words. She was inspired by conversations with her family, realizing how much personal history was being lost. Her subjects find the process rewarding, as it allows them to reflect on their lives and share stories with their families, often uncovering unresolved issues from childhood that influence their behavior. Hannah maintains confidentiality, encouraging honesty, and people appreciate the opportunity to document their roots in a world where extended families are less common. The process involves up to 30 hours of interviews, and the resulting books are well-crafted and priced at nearly £3,000, attracting interest primarily from affluent individuals, though the cost deters many.","Although many of us have photographs of our grandparents, we frequently lack a deep understanding of their lives and youthful characters, with diaries offering only fragmented glimpses and family anecdotes being imperfectly recalled. We similarly procrastinate in documenting our own experiences for posterity. Hannah Renier has devised a solution by authoring autobiographies for ordinary people, creating hardback books of at least 20,000 words, complete with illustrations if desired. This concept emerged from her familial discussions, where she recognized the gradual erosion of personal history. Her clients, who often lead intriguing lives, derive significant personal satisfaction from the process, aiming to leave a legacy for their children while gaining self-insight. The assurance of privacy helps them overcome self-censorship, leading to candid accounts that may reveal painful events or repetitive behavioral patterns rooted in childhood. Hannah acts as a discreet recorder, not an interrogator, and individuals generally strive for honesty. She views this as a means to preserve roots in an era of rapid change and diminished family cohesion. The books, which involve extensive interviews and careful editing, are of high quality and cost nearly £3,000, with additional copies at £25 each. While she receives numerous inquiries weekly, the expense limits participation largely to a wealthier clientele, contrary to her initial expectations.","Ordinary people, ordinary lives

Analogously, aspirations to chronicle our own existences for subsequent generations are often deferred indefinitely. Hannah Renier has conceived an innovative response by composing autobiographies on behalf of ordinary persons, yielding hardback volumes of no fewer than 20,000 words—supplemented with illustrations as requested—which chronicle not the renowned but the commonplace. This notion materialized during her dialogues with relatives, wherein she apprehended the progressive dissolution of personal heritage integral to her own life. Her subjects, who have led genuinely captivating lives, initially engage for familial or posteritarian motives yet derive considerable personal enrichment from the endeavor. The guarantee of confidentiality mitigates innate self-censorship, facilitating forthright disclosures that frequently unearth unresolved afflictions, such as marital dissolution, and illuminate recurrent behavioral paradigms instilled in childhood. Renier adopts the role of an impartial archivist rather than an inquisitor, and participants typically exhibit a propensity for unvarnished veracity, embracing their narratives in their entirety. She perceives this undertaking as a method to anchor individuals in an epoch of accelerated transformation and attenuated extended family structures, thereby conferring a semblance of immortality. Each publication entails up to thirty hours of recorded interviews, which Renier meticulously reorganizes and interprets, employing contemporary technology to produce all components save the gold-lettered binding, with clients selecting bespoke details. The culminative works, meticulously structured and elegantly composed, are intended for intimate audiences and eschew sensationalism; they are far from inexpensive, commanding nearly £3,000 per copy, with duplicates available at £25. Despite approximately ten weekly inquiries, the inherent cost—a consequence of the protracted labor involved—serves as a deterrent to many, attracting principally an affluent demographic, contrary to Renier's initial anticipation of a more modest market."
206,"WEATHERVANE MAKER

THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill, going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham's designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. 'That way I can produce a unique personalised item,' he explains. 'A lot of my customers are women buying presents for their husbands. They want a distinctive gift that represents the man's business or leisure interests.'
It's all a far cry from the traditional cockerel, the most common design for weathervanes.
It was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick that featured on the first weathervane Graham ever made. Friends admired his surprise present for his wife and began asking him to make vanes for them. 'I realised that when it came to subjects that could be made into them, the possibilities were limitless,' he says.
Graham decided to concentrate his efforts on a weathervane business. He had sewed an apprenticeship as a precision engineer and had worked in that trade for 15 years when he and his wife, Liz, agreed to swap roles - she went out to work as an architectural assistant and he stayed at home to look after the children and build up the business.
That was five years ago and he has no regrets about his new direction. 'My previous work didn't have an artistic element to it, whereas this is exciting and creative,' he says. 'I really enjoy the design side.'
Graham has now perfected over 100 original designs. He works to very fine detail, always seeking approval for the design of the silhouette from the customer before proceeding with the hand-cutting.
Graham also keeps plenty of traditional designs in stock, since they prove as popular as the one-offs. 'It seems that people are attracted to hand-crafting,' Graham says. 'They welcome the opportunity to acquire something a little bit different.'
Graham has no plans for expansion, as he wants to keep the business as a rural craft.
'I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality and I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a nondescript shape turn into something almost lifelike,' he says.
'For centuries, weathervanes have kept communities in touch with the elements signalling those shifts in wind direction that bring about changes in the weather,' he explains.
'And nowadays, with more and more people moving to the country, individuals want to put an exclusive finishing touch to their properties. It has been a boost to crafts like mine.'
Graham has become increasingly busy, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide.

As one of the few artisans in the nation producing hand-cut weathervanes, he devises bespoke designs meticulously tailored to clients' precise requirements, thereby generating singular, personalised artefacts. A significant proportion of his clientele comprises women procuring distinctive gifts emblematic of their husbands' vocational or avocational pursuits, diverging markedly from the conventional cockerel motif. Graham's inaugural creation featured a witch astride a broomstick, a surprise present for his wife that garnered admiration from acquaintances and precipitated solicitations for custom vanes, revealing the boundless potential for thematic variation. He elected to dedicate his endeavours exclusively to this enterprise, following a 15-year tenure as a precision engineer—a role he relinquished in a mutual arrangement with his spouse, who commenced employment as an architectural assistant, enabling him to assume domestic responsibilities and cultivate the business. Eschewing any regret regarding this vocational reorientation, he extols the exhilarating and creative dimensions of his current pursuit, in stark contrast to his prior occupation's lack of artistic elements. Having refined in excess of one hundred original designs, he operates with fastidious attention to detail, invariably securing client endorsement for the silhouette prior to executing the hand-cutting process. Concurrently, he retains an inventory of traditional designs, which enjoy comparable popularity to the unique commissions, attributing this to a pervasive appreciation for hand-craftsmanship and the desire for idiosyncratic acquisitions. Graham intends to forgo expansion, aspiring to sustain the enterprise as an exemplar of rural artistry, having identified his niche in a market that values individuality; he derives profound gratification from transmuting nondescript forms into quasi-animate representations. He elucidates that, for centuries, weathervanes have served to keep communities apprised of elemental shifts, signalling alterations in wind direction that precipitate meteorological changes. In contemporary contexts, with escalating migration to rural locales, individuals seek to impart an exclusive finishing touch to their properties, thereby invigorating artisanal trades such as his. Consequently, he has experienced escalating demand, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to an international clientele, with notable interest from American and Danish purchasers. Pricing is contingent upon the intricacy of the design, as exemplified by a recent commission for a curly-coated dog, enabling Graham to fabricate gifts of unparalleled distinctiveness for any occasion."

Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game -- surveillance of a suspicious bookshop -- when she realises that one of its rare customers is her
Uncle Jim.
He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime, manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends, whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard.
When Emma finds her life in danger, things take a dark and compelling turn - her confinement in the cellar of a derelict house is stunningly handled.
This book reveals the minutiae of family life, the bonds of childhood friendship and warns that adults aren't always the protectors they ought to be. A vital and convincing read.

Backtrack

Peter Hunt

Two teenagers, 'peasant' Jack and Rill, a boarder at a posh girls school, join forces on realising that relatives of both were involved in an apparently inexplicable 1915 train accident, in which eight people died. Varied viewpoints and documents -- maps, first-hand accounts, hurt records, railway histories -- throw an ever-changing light on the incident, so that the reader works as hard as the two protagonists to understand what happened and why. A clever, complex novel which rewards close attention.

Pigeon Summer

Ann Turnbull

Mary Dyer doesn't really fit into her family or male-dominated culture; for one thing, she, a girl, loves her father's racing pigeons and when he must go away to find work, Mary knows enough to carry on managing the loft and winning prizes, despite increasing conflict with her harassed mother. Set believably in 1930, this readable tale has a sound basic message that 'There are different kinds of cleverness', which can't be bad. Thoughtful readers should find satisfaction here.

Yaxley's Cat

Robert Westall

Unusually, Robert Westall uses the viewpoint of a mature woman for this chilling story of rural prejudice and persecution. Rose, to escape from her materialistic life and her smug husband, rents Sepp Yaxley's cottage with her two children. A ferocious cat, and bizarre items found in cupboards, reveal the answer to why Yaxley disappeared, but the newcomers' presence arouses local hostility to the point where their own lives are at risk. By the end, the threatening violence is controlled, but Rose feels just as dismayed by the methodical ruthlessness of her teenage son. Utterly gripping.

Someone's Mother is Missing

Harry Mazer

At the poor, shambling, noisy end of the family there's Sam - fat, overtalkative and awed by his supercool and sophisticated cousin,
Lisa, from the apparently rich end of the clan. When Lisa's privileged world crumbles, it's Sam who helps her to find some balance, out of which both gain a better sense of reality and the value of family.
The pace is slightly slow in parts but there's a gentle humour and the developing closeness of the two teenagers is convincingly handled. It could be interesting to both boys and girls, which is a bit of a rarity.

Stanley's Aquarium

Barry Faville

Barry Faville writes with assurance and humour, vividly evoking his New Zealand setting and creating an intelligent and likeable first-person narrator. Robbie takes a jon gardening for elderly Stanley, finding him at first fascinating and later repellent; when she finds out what he keeps in his aquarium and what he plans to do with them, the book takes 'thrillerish' twist without losing its sharp insight into character and relationships. Unusual and compelling.

Dodger

Libby Gleeson

A painful, sad story where the troubled personal relationships plus the stormy school life of Mick are told though a skilful blend of flashback, a teacher's letters to a friend, the boys own notes and sympathetic narrative. Coming to terms with the negative expectations of others and his own poor sense of self-worth is achieved through a role in a school play and by an impressively sensitive first-year teacher.

Although the pace is intermittently languid, gentle humor and the convincingly handled evolution of their rapport make it intriguing for both sexes. Barry Faville's 'Stanley's Aquarium' is composed with assurance and humor, vividly evoking the New Zealand milieu and featuring an intelligent, likable narrator, Robbie. She undertakes a gardening position for elderly Stanley, initially finding him fascinating but subsequently repellent; upon uncovering the contents of his aquarium and his intentions, the novel assumes a 'thrillerish' twist without forfeiting acute insights into character and interpersonal dynamics. This unusual and compelling work is highly engaging. Libby Gleeson's 'Dodger' is a poignant, sorrowful tale wherein Mick's troubled personal relationships and tumultuous school life are related through an adept amalgamation of flashbacks, a teacher's epistolary communications, the boy's own annotations, and a sympathetic narrative. Achieving reconciliation with others' negative expectations and his own deficient self-regard is facilitated by a role in a school production and an impressively sensitive first-year educator. It is highly recommended, albeit genuinely agonizing, especially in its denouement.","Hide and Seek

209,"NATURAL TALENTS

In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't had time to develop any differences: genetically we're still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps.
On this grand evolutionary scale, whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art (whatever changes were needed in the human physique, brain, and sense organs) and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes.
That's a large burden to place on a relative handful of genes. It should come as no surprise, then, that modern studies of animal behaviour have been shrinking the list of attributes once considered uniquely human, so that most differences between us and animals now appear to be only matters of degree.
For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees (which use sticks as eating utensils and weapons), and sea otters (which crack open clams with rocks). As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals. But if human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, isn't it strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps?
The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art, in the form of the famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces and musical instruments.
If we're going to insist that our recent creative burst finally does set us apart, then in what ways do we claim that our art differs from the superficially similar works of animals? Three supposed distinctions are often put forward: human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Let's scrutinise these claims.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless"". The implicit meaning a biologist sees behind this quip is that human an doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes -- the evident functions of most animal behaviours. Of course, much human an is utilitarian in the sense that the artist communicates something to fellow humans, but transmitting one's thoughts or feelings isn't the same as passing on one's genes. In contrast, birdsong serves the obvious functions of defending a territory or wooing a mate, and thereby transmitting genes. By this criterion human art does seem different.
The second claim -- that only human art not is motivated by aesthetic pleasure -- also seems plausible. While we can't ask robins whether they enjoy the form or beauty of their songs, it's suspicious that they sing mainly during the breeding season. Hence they're probably not singing just for aesthetic pleasure. Again, by this criterion human art seems unique.
As for human art's third distinction -- that it's a learned rather than an instinctive activity -- each human group does have distinctive art styles that surely are learned. For example, it's easy to distinguish typical songs being sung today in Tokyo and in Paris. But those stylistic differences aren't wired into the singers genes. The French and Japanese often visit each other's cities and can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some species of birds inherit the ability to produce the particular song of their species. Each of those birds would sing the right song even if it had never heard the tune. It's as if a French baby adopted by Japanese parents, flown in infancy to Tokyo and educated there, began to sing the French national anthem spontaneously.
The role of learning in human art is also clear in how quickly our an styles change. Roman authors described geese honking 2,000 years ago, as geese still do today. But humans innovate so rapidly that even a casual museum-goer would recognise almost any twentieth century painting as having been made later than, say, the Mona Lisa. Connoisseurs can do better, of course. When shown a work with which they are not familiar, they can often identify not only when it was painted but who painted it.
Yet even connoisseurs would mistake the identity of two mid-twentieth century artists named Congo and Betsy. If judged only by their works, they would probably be identified as lesser-known abstract expressionists. In fact the painters were chimpanzees. Congo did up to 33 paintings and drawings in one day, apparently for his own satisfaction, and threw a tantrum when his pencil was taken away.
Congo and Betsy were honoured by a two-chimp show of their paintings in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art. What's more, most of the paintings available at that show sold; plenty of human artists can't make that boast.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction. You might object that human art is still different because most human artists intend their art as a means of communication. The apes, on the other hand, were so indifferent to communicating with other apes that they just discarded their paintings. But that objection doesn't strike me as fatal, since even some human art that later became famous was created by artists for their private satisfaction.",C1,"Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We share over 98% of our genes. Humans make art, but animals do many things like humans. For example, chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons. Sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys have sounds for danger. Art is something special for humans. The first art we know is from 35,000 years ago, like cave paintings. People say human art is not for survival, it is for beauty, and we learn it. But chimpanzees like Congo also painted pictures. They did it for fun, not to talk to others. This makes it hard to say only humans make art.","Humans and chimpanzees separated about 7 million years ago, but we are still 98% the same genetically. The things that make humans different from animals, like art, come from only a few genes. Studies show animals have many skills we thought were only human. Chimpanzees use tools like sticks for eating and fighting. Sea otters use rocks to break open clams. Monkeys have warning calls for different dangers. Art is one of the few things that might be only human. The earliest clear art, such as cave paintings and statues, started around 35,000 years ago. People argue that human art is not useful for survival, it is for enjoyment, and it is learned, not from genes. But chimpanzees like Congo painted many pictures for pleasure, and their art was sold in shows. This shows that animal art can be similar to human art in some ways.","Humans and chimpanzees diverged around 7 million years ago, yet we remain over 98% genetically identical. The characteristics that distinguish humans, such as art, likely stem from a small fraction of our genes. Research on animal behavior has reduced the list of traits once considered unique to humans; most differences are now seen as matters of degree. For instance, chimpanzees employ sticks as tools for eating and defense, while sea otters utilize rocks to open clams. Monkeys possess a basic language with distinct alarm calls for predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. Art remains a potential absolute difference, but if it were genetically based, why did early humans not practice it for most of their history? Definitive evidence of human art, including cave paintings and musical instruments, emerges only about 35,000 years ago with Cro-Magnons. Claims that human art is non-utilitarian, driven by aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than innate are often made. However, chimpanzees like Congo created paintings for personal satisfaction, not survival, and their works were exhibited and sold, blurring these distinctions and challenging the uniqueness of human art.","In the approximately 7 million years since humans and chimpanzees diverged, we have maintained over 98% genetic similarity, indicating that the traits setting us apart, including art, arise from a minimal genetic basis. Contemporary studies of animal behavior have progressively diminished the catalogue of attributes deemed exclusively human, revealing that most disparities are quantitative rather than qualitative. Tools, for example, are utilized by wild chimpanzees, who wield sticks as implements and weapons, and by sea otters, who employ rocks to fracture clamshells. Monkeys exhibit a rudimentary language with specific vocalizations for threats such as leopards, eagles, and snakes. Art persists as a conceivable absolute distinction, yet if it were innately genetic, it is puzzling that ancestral humans abstained from it for the vast majority of their evolutionary timeline. Unambiguous proof of distinctly human art, manifest in cave paintings, sculptures, and musical instruments, does not appear until roughly 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons. Assertions that human art is non-utilitarian, motivated by aesthetic appreciation, and culturally transmitted rather than instinctive are frequently proposed. Nonetheless, instances like the chimpanzee Congo, who produced numerous paintings for intrinsic satisfaction and whose works were commercially sold in art exhibitions, complicate these criteria and suggest that the boundaries between human and animal artistic expressions are not as clear-cut as once presumed.","NATURAL TALENTS

The implicit meaning a biologist sees behind this quip is that human an doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes -- the evident functions of most animal behaviours. Of course, much human an is utilitarian in the sense that the artist communicates something to fellow humans, but transmitting one's thoughts or feelings isn't the same as passing on one's genes. In contrast, birdsong serves the obvious functions of defending a territory or wooing a mate, and thereby transmitting genes. By this criterion human art does seem different.
The second claim -- that only human art not is motivated by aesthetic pleasure -- also seems plausible. While we can't ask robins whether they enjoy the form or beauty of their songs, it's suspicious that they sing mainly during the breeding season. Hence they're probably not singing just for aesthetic pleasure. Again, by this criterion human art seems unique.
As for human art's third distinction -- that it's a learned rather than an instinctive activity -- each human group does have distinctive art styles that surely are learned. For example, it's easy to distinguish typical songs being sung today in Tokyo and in Paris. But those stylistic differences aren't wired into the singers genes. The French and Japanese often visit each other's cities and can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some species of birds inherit the ability to produce the particular song of their species. Each of those birds would sing the right song even if it had never heard the tune. It's as if a French baby adopted by Japanese parents, flown in infancy to Tokyo and educated there, began to sing the French national anthem spontaneously.
The role of learning in human art is also clear in how quickly our an styles change. Roman authors described geese honking 2,000 years ago, as geese still do today. But humans innovate so rapidly that even a casual museum-goer would recognise almost any twentieth century painting as having been made later than, say, the Mona Lisa. Connoisseurs can do better, of course. When shown a work with which they are not familiar, they can often identify not only when it was painted but who painted it.
Yet even connoisseurs would mistake the identity of two mid-twentieth century artists named Congo and Betsy. If judged only by their works, they would probably be identified as lesser-known abstract expressionists. In fact the painters were chimpanzees. Congo did up to 33 paintings and drawings in one day, apparently for his own satisfaction, and threw a tantrum when his pencil was taken away.
Congo and Betsy were honoured by a two-chimp show of their paintings in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art. What's more, most of the paintings available at that show sold; plenty of human artists can't make that boast.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction. You might object that human art is still different because most human artists intend their art as a means of communication. The apes, on the other hand, were so indifferent to communicating with other apes that they just discarded their paintings. But that objection doesn't strike me as fatal, since even some human art that later became famous was created by artists for their private satisfaction.","Over the mere seven million years since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees, our genetic constitution has remained remarkably conserved, with over 98 percent identity, implying that the faculties distinguishing Homo sapiens, such as artistic expression, must be attributable to an exceedingly minute fraction of our genome. On this grand evolutionary scale, the attributes that ostensibly set humans apart from other animals represent very recent developments, and modern ethological investigations have consistently eroded the catalogue of characteristics once considered uniquely human, revealing that most disparities are merely gradational in nature. For instance, tool use is not an exclusive human prerogative; wild chimpanzees adeptly employ sticks as utensils and armaments, while sea otters strategically deploy rocks to access bivalves. Similarly, primates exhibit a rudimentary linguistic system with discrete alarm calls for specific predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. Art remains one of the few putative absolute differentiators, yet if it were a consequence of a singular genetic endowment, it is perplexing that our forebears eschewed it for the initial 6.9 million years post-divergence. Unequivocal evidence of distinctly human art, in the form of cave paintings, statuary, adornments, and musical instruments, only surfaces with the Cro-Magnons approximately 35,000 years ago. The oft-invoked distinctions—that human art is non-utilitarian, driven by aesthetic pleasure, and culturally transmitted rather than genetically determined—warrant scrutiny. Consider the chimpanzee Congo, who produced up to 33 artworks daily for personal gratification, exhibited vehement distress upon interruption, and whose pieces were vendued at a prestigious London gallery; such phenomena obfuscate the purported uniqueness of human art by demonstrating that animal activities can embody non-instrumentality and intrinsic motivation, thereby challenging anthropocentric assertions and inviting a more nuanced interpretation of artistic behavior across species."
210,"Young Masters

Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks again to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man's game.

After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. Mr Spassky is even older.
Chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. A new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win.
In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense: a chess clock is used to ensure that each player completes the stipulated number of moves in the allotted time - failure to do so results in immediate loss of the game. But now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. It is significant that, of the world's ten highest-ranked players, eight are under 30.
Nor is it only the way the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess is played off the board - and not just the battle for psychological advantage that Mr Fischer wages so well. Every professional must now take seriously his pre-match preparation, not least because the age of computer databases has had a profound impact on chess. A small portable computer can hold one million chess games, and give instant access to hundreds of games of a prospective opponent.
In one recent contest, each of the protagonists employed large teams of assistants to work round the clock searching for flaws in the other's repertoire. The opening stages of a chess game are now analysed to near exhaustion. Simply being better prepared in chess opening can be the deciding factor in the game.
The chess world today boasts more first-rate players than at any stage in its history. Hundreds of grandmasters chase modest prize money the world over. Success demands physical as well as mental exertion. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension.
The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. When this occurs, each player has only seconds to make several moves or face instant forfeiture. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire. Such moments are not for reflective intellectuals. The game descends into a primeval struggle in which nerves, tenacity and an overwhelming will to win separate victor from vanquished.
At the top level of chess, the pain of losing is unbearable. Winning brings immense satisfaction and a chance to recover from the nerves and exhaustion. But one victory is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready for the struggle the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9-11 days, with play on every day, and there is an all-year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more exacting. The 1984 encounter between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be aborted after several months on the grounds of mutual exhaustion. Mr Karpov had shed around two stone (10kg) in weight.
Can Mr Fischer defy these odds? He once declared ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess.""
This sentiment made his exodus from the chess world after 1972 seem even more inexplicable. But in some respects it was a fitting end to his story. It immortalised Bobby Fischer.
If he has come back for the money, he is onto a good thing. Whatever happens in his match with Mr Spassky, each will end up several million dollars richer. But if Mr Fischer has returned in the sincere belief that he can show he is still the best player in the world, the final result could be heartbreaking.",C1,"Bobby Fischer is a chess player. He is 49 years old. He is playing chess again after 20 years. He is playing against Boris Spassky. Bobby won the first game. But he is older now. Chess has changed. Now, young people are better at chess. Many top players are under 30 years old. Chess is hard. Players must think fast. They use a clock. If they are slow, they lose. Chess games can last many hours.

But it will be difficult for him to be the best player again.","Bobby Fischer, aged 49, has returned to chess after 20 years of absence and is competing against his old rival Boris Spassky. Although Fischer won the first game impressively, he is no longer the same player he was in 1972 due to his age and lack of practice. Chess has evolved significantly over the past two decades, becoming more professional and youth-oriented. The majority of the world's top players are now under 30, as the game demands intense mental and physical endurance. Players face pressure from chess clocks, with games lasting up to eight hours, and must maintain concentration to avoid mistakes. Preparation is crucial, often involving computer databases to study opponents. Fischer's comeback could bring him financial gain, but if he aims to prove he is still the best, the outcome might be disappointing.","Bobby Fischer, at 49 years old, has emerged from two decades of self-imposed exile to resume his chess career against Boris Spassky. His victory in the initial game was a masterful display, yet subsequent performances reveal that he is not the formidable player of 1972, being out of practice and physically unfit. Chess has undergone substantial changes, shifting towards a youth-dominated arena where over 80% of the top-ranked players are under 30. The game now emphasizes professionalism, with prolonged sessions that test nerves and stamina, aided by chess clocks that enforce strict time limits. Extensive pre-match preparation, leveraging computer databases containing millions of games, has become essential. Fischer's return may yield substantial financial rewards, but if his intent is to reclaim his status as the world's best, the result could be deeply disheartening given the evolved competitive landscape.","Young Masters

Fischer's triumph in the opening game was a paragon of simplicity and depth, yet ensuing contests have exposed his diminished capacities relative to his 1972 zenith, compounded by advanced age and physical deconditioning. Chess has metamorphosed into a domain increasingly favoring youth, evidenced by the trend wherein each successive world champion has been younger than the last, and eight of the top ten players globally are under 30. This shift is propelled by heightened professionalism, where competitive exigencies supersede artistic and scientific dimensions, necessitating formidable nerves and endurance amid protracted playing sessions governed by chess clocks. The advent of computer databases has revolutionized preparatory strategies, enabling exhaustive analysis of openings and opponents' repertoires. Fischer's resurgence, whether driven by pecuniary motives—promising lucrative gains—or a sincere aspiration to demonstrate enduring supremacy, risks culminating in profound disillusionment given the arduous demands of contemporary elite chess."
211,"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world, comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is housed in a purpose-built gallery with excellent natural light. The advantages of plaster casts are many: groups of sculptures originally set up together but now split between various museums all over Europe can be viewed together as originally intended. Nearly all the most celebrated works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in one afternoon.

C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology

The Sedgwick Museum houses a magnificent collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks and minerals of all geological ages, and from all parts of the world. It also houses Britain's oldest intact geological collection, that of Dr John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original early 18th century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was Professor of Geology and keeper of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his long life, he added enormously to the collections, laying the foundations of a truly outstanding museum. The collection is arranged by geological age so that the major changes in life on Earth can be traced through time.
The new Whewell Gallery houses the beautiful minerals and gems of the collection. The displays are accompanied by full explanatory labels to explain both their nature and modern use.

D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs

There are over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs in the collection, taken by members of the university's staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and undertakes photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are of considerable general interest as a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the effects of human activity from prehistoric times to the present day. There is a small display in the entrance hall and the knowledgeable library staff will be happy to deal with canicular enquiries.

Women on a winning streak

To excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to just a haw brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, 27, skier

""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well or it's windy and you can't see, but you just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""

B. Caroline, 22, cyclist

""Two years ago I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I am because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money I do at least four hours' training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming and running.
My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he knows the time you have to put into it -- it would be impossible otherwise.""

C. Annabel, 26, rower

""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There's no continuity so the women's squad is basically a shambles. But it's great fun and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life.""

D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker

""At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different.
The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had as far as pain is concerned. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.""

E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer

""Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages.
When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!
You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been classed as eccentrics. It's great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection always trying to get round with a perfect lap.""

F. Alison, 28, triathlete

""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I'd really be one, c) racing is very social.
Men and women usually compete together but when an event is given coverage in the press, 90 per cent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 per cent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it.""",C1,"Great sports. Women are winning a lot.

Women are on a winning streak. Excelling in any sport is challenging, and for women, it can be even tougher. Training and competition take up most of their time, requiring significant sacrifices in their personal lives. Despite this, they are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. In this article, we interview several outstanding British sportswomen. Jill, aged 27, is a skier. She describes the thrill of flying through the air and landing cleanly, though it can be intimidating, especially in poor conditions. With ten months of training each year, she has little opportunity for a career outside skiing and has given up much of her social life, but she accepts this as her choice. The British team includes six men and three women, all competing on equal terms in the same events. Caroline, 22, is a cyclist. She started cycling two years ago by borrowing a bike for a charity race and won unexpectedly. As a professional, she earns well and has potential for endorsements, but she is concerned that people might attribute her success to her appearance rather than her ability. Therefore, she concentrates on her cycling, training over four hours daily along with other exercises. Her boyfriend, also a cyclist, supports her commitment. Annabel, 26, is a rower. She notes that rowing is not widely available in girls' schools, so many start late, hindering international success. Frequent coach changes lead to a lack of continuity, making the women's squad disorganized. Nonetheless, she enjoys the sport for its fitness benefits and social aspects. Ffyona, 24, is a long-distance walker. She dreamed of walking the world as a teenager and found Britain too confining. Her walk across Australia was extremely painful, with long hours, minimal sleep, and numerous blisters, but she achieved a record under time pressure from her sponsorship. She observes that men often perceive women as higher risks for failure in sponsorship. Lisa, 26, races saloon cars. She encounters men with large egos who ignore her when she performs well, and she faces aggressive competition on the track. Being naturally competitive, she persists despite financial struggles, as earnings are reinvested into the sport. Women racers have historically been viewed as eccentrics, but their numbers are growing. Lisa is driven by the pursuit of perfection in each lap. Alison, 28, is a triathlete. Her routine involves early morning swims and evening training, often leading to fatigue. She experiences pre-race nerves and pushes herself to the limit during competitions. She participates to maintain happiness and fitness, and to avoid laziness. Triathlons offer a social environment, but media coverage disproportionately favors men, and women receive lower prize money. However, through a new women's commission, efforts are underway to address these issues.","Great sports. Women on a winning streak. Achieving excellence in any sport is inherently difficult, and for women, the challenges are often doubled. The demands of training and competition leave scant room for a conventional lifestyle, necessitating considerable sacrifices. Nevertheless, these athletes are defying the odds, overcoming prejudice, and shattering records. Here, we engage with a selection of remarkable British sportswomen. Jill, 27, is a skier. She relishes the sensation of soaring through the air and executing a clean landing, though admits it can be daunting, particularly under adverse conditions such as illness or poor visibility. With training occupying ten months annually, pursuing an alternative career is impractical, and she has forgone much of her social life—a choice she consciously made. The British team comprises six men and three women, all competing identically in the same events and receiving equal treatment. Caroline, 22, is a cyclist. Two years prior, she participated in a charity race on a borrowed bike and triumphed by outpacing all competitors, an astonishing feat for a novice. As a professional, she is remunerated handsomely and has substantial endorsement potential. However, she is apprehensive that her success might be attributed to her physical appearance rather than her cycling prowess, prompting her to focus intensely on her sport. Her regimen includes at least four hours of daily cycling supplemented by stretching, swimming, and running. Her boyfriend, also a cyclist, comprehends the extensive time investment required. Annabel, 26, is a rower. She highlights that rowing is inaccessible to many girls due to its scarcity in schools, resulting in a late start that impedes international achievement. Moreover, the frequent turnover of coaches—typically lasting only a year—creates a lack of continuity, rendering the women's squad chaotic. Despite this, she derives pleasure from the activity, values the fitness it affords, and appreciates the vibrant social scene. Ffyona, 24, is a long-distance walker. At age 13, she aspired to circumnavigate the globe, unaware of its vastness, and found Britain too constricting and secure. Now more diplomatic, she reflects on varied walking experiences; the traverse of Australia was her most agonizing, involving 50-mile, 21-hour daily marches with mere three-hour sleeps in extreme heat, all while enduring multiple blisters. She secured the record under the pressure of expiring sponsorship funds, noting that men often regard female athletes as likelier to fail, thus deeming sponsorship riskier. Lisa, 26, is a saloon car racer. She observes that some male drivers exhibit substantial egos, often ignoring her when she excels. As a woman, she faces disadvantages, with male competitors aggressively targeting her, resulting in numerous collisions. Inherently competitive and assertive, she struggles financially, as any earnings are reinvested into racing. Women have been involved in motorsport since the 1920s, traditionally labeled as eccentrics, but their participation is increasingly prevalent. Lisa is captivated by the relentless pursuit of a flawless lap. Alison, 28, is a triathlete. She rises at 5:30 AM thrice weekly for swimming, requiring additional mornings for rest, and trains in the evenings, occasionally dozing off at work due to exhaustion. Pre-race nervousness culminates in intense self-pushing during events. Her motivations include enhanced happiness and fitness, countering a latent tendency toward indolence, and the social dimension of racing. Although men and women compete together, media coverage disproportionately emphasizes male events, and prize money is inferior for women. However, the establishment of an International Triathlon Women's Commission signifies proactive efforts to rectify these disparities.","Great sports

Attaining preeminence in any athletic discipline is arduous in itself, yet women frequently confront compounded obstacles. The rigors of training and competition permit minimal scope for a conventional existence, mandating substantial personal sacrifices. Despite these impediments, they are surmounting biases and eclipsing records. Herein, we converse with an array of distinguished British sportswomen. Jill, 27, is a skier. She extols the exhilaration of aerial maneuvers and impeccable landings, albeit acknowledging the potential for trepidation, particularly amidst inclement conditions or personal malaise. With training consuming ten months per annum, extraneous career pursuits are infeasible, and she has relinquished a significant portion of her social milieu—a deliberate election. The British contingent consists of six male and three female athletes, all engaging in identical competitions under equitable treatment. Caroline, 22, is a cyclist. Two years antecedent, she procured a bicycle for a charitable race and prevailed by outperforming all adversaries, a remarkable outcome for an initiate. As a professional, she commands a substantial income and possesses considerable endorsement prospects. Nevertheless, she harbors apprehension that her accomplishments might be ascribed to her comeliness rather than her cycling acumen, thus she currently prioritizes athletic refinement. Her regimen encompasses no less than four hours of daily cycling, augmented by stretching, aquatic, and running exercises. Her paramour, likewise a cyclist, apprehends the requisite temporal dedication. Annabel, 26, is a rower. She underscores that rowing remains largely inaccessible to females owing to its paucity in educational institutions, precipitating a belated inception that hampers international prowess. Furthermore, the transitory tenure of coaches—typically enduring merely a year—engenders a dearth of continuity, resulting in a disorganized women's squad. Notwithstanding, she derives immense gratification from the pursuit, cherishes the physical conditioning it imparts, and values the convivial social interactions. Ffyona, 24, is a long-distance walker. At the age of 13, she envisioned traversing the globe, oblivious to its magnitude, and perceived Britain as overly insular and secure. Presently more circumspect, she recounts diverse peregrinations; the Australian expedition constituted her most harrowing ordeal in terms of agony, entailing diurnal marches of 50 miles over 21 hours with scant repose in elevated temperatures, all while contending with copious blisters. She attained the record under the duress of imminent sponsorship expiration, observing that males often perceive female athletes as predisposed to failure, thereby rendering sponsorship a perilous venture. Lisa, 26, is a saloon car racer. She discerns that certain male drivers exhibit pronounced egotism, frequently eschewing communication when she excels. As a woman, she encounters disadvantages, with male rivals intensifying their efforts to surpass her, culminating in numerous impacts. Inherently combative and assertive, she grapples with financial viability, as any remuneration is reinvested into the sport. Women have participated in racing since the 1920s, historically categorized as eccentrics, yet their numbers are burgeoning. Lisa is enthralled by the ceaseless quest for an impeccable circuit. Alison, 28, is a triathlete. She ascends at 5:30 on three mornings weekly for aquatic training, necessitating additional matutinal periods for recuperation, and engages in cycling or running in the evenings, occasionally succumbing to somnolence at her workstation due to fatigue. Pre-competition anxiety escalates into profound self-exertion during events. Her rationales encompass augmented felicity and physical robustness, countervailing an intrinsic proclivity for indolence, and the sociable nature of racing. Although competitions are co-ed, media reportage disproportionately accentuates male events, and monetary prizes are inferior for women. However, the inception of an International Triathlon Women's Commission denotes concerted endeavors to ameliorate these inequities."
213,"Sea, Ice & Rock

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy.
In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing.
It was the first time I'd been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin's skills at climbing.
The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.
He was used to using his arms, I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down quite safely. It was during that trip to Skye that Robin and I built the foundation of a very real friendship.
His proposal that we should combine our skills on a joint trip to Greenland was just an extension, on a rather grand scale, of our voyage to Skye. Robin impressed me immensely as a leader. Traditionally, the skipper makes all the decisions.
But Robin made a point of consulting everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel you were part of the decision-making process.
To be frank, I found the sailing trying and very boring. The moments of crisis which we had on the way back were easy to deal with: the adrenaline pumps and you get all worked up. The bit I found difficult was spending day after day in the middle of the sea.
I am a land-lover and not really a do-it-yourself type of person. Robin, in contrast, is a natural sailor and seemed to enjoy tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. I was aware that Robin didn't really need me.
To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that very trying. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.
When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin's life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral -- Greenland's highest mountain - would be.
Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.
He just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.
Yet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.
The previous night I'd almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd jumped to the wrong conclusion.
While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.",C1,"Chris Bonnington is a famous mountain climber. He climbed Mount Everest in 1985. He wrote books.

In Greenland, Chris was responsible for Robin's safety during climbs. Robin was not a natural climber, but he tried hard and trusted Chris completely. Once, Robin did not wake Chris for his watch on the boat, which made Chris feel insecure. But Robin explained it was a mistake, and they remained friends.

He has written books like 'Quest for Adventure'. Robin Knox-Johnston, a sailor, was the first to sail around the world alone. They teamed up for a trip to Greenland, combining sailing and climbing, which they wrote about in their book 'Sea, Ice and Rock'. Their friendship began when Chris joined Robin for a sail to Skye, where Chris taught climbing and Robin taught sailing. Chris found sailing tedious and felt ineffective, as the yacht was overcrowded. In Greenland, Chris led the climbing expeditions and worried about Robin's safety, especially since Robin was inexperienced. Robin showed great trust in Chris during difficult climbs. A minor conflict occurred when Robin did not wake Chris for his watch, making Chris feel distrusted, but Robin clarified it was not intentional. Through this experience, they deepened their friendship, with Chris discovering Robin's kind and sensitive nature.","Chris Bonnington, an accomplished mountaineer renowned for his 1985 Everest ascent, has pioneered climbing routes and authored numerous books, including 'Quest for Adventure'. Robin Knox-Johnston, a seasoned sailor, made history by completing the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. They collaborated on a joint expedition to Greenland, documented in their publication 'Sea, Ice and Rock'. Their partnership originated from a sailing trip to Skye, where Chris introduced Robin to climbing techniques, and Robin imparted sailing fundamentals. Chris found the sailing monotonous and struggled with feelings of inadequacy, exacerbated by the cramped conditions on the yacht. During the Greenland climb, Chris assumed leadership and was acutely aware of the risks, as Robin's inexperience could have endangered both. Robin demonstrated immense trust, following Chris's guidance without question. A brief tension arose when Robin opted not to awaken Chris for his watch duty, leading Chris to feel insecure, but Robin promptly reassured him. This expedition solidified their bond, revealing Robin's underlying kindness and sensitivity.","Sea, Ice & Rock

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy.
In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing.
It was the first time I'd been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin's skills at climbing.
The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.
He was used to using his arms, I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down quite safely. It was during that trip to Skye that Robin and I built the foundation of a very real friendship.
His proposal that we should combine our skills on a joint trip to Greenland was just an extension, on a rather grand scale, of our voyage to Skye. Robin impressed me immensely as a leader. Traditionally, the skipper makes all the decisions.
But Robin made a point of consulting everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel you were part of the decision-making process.
To be frank, I found the sailing trying and very boring. The moments of crisis which we had on the way back were easy to deal with: the adrenaline pumps and you get all worked up. The bit I found difficult was spending day after day in the middle of the sea.
I am a land-lover and not really a do-it-yourself type of person. Robin, in contrast, is a natural sailor and seemed to enjoy tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. I was aware that Robin didn't really need me.
To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that very trying. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.
When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin's life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral -- Greenland's highest mountain - would be.
Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.
He just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.
Yet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.
The previous night I'd almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd jumped to the wrong conclusion.
While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.","Chris Bonnington, the esteemed mountaineer celebrated for his 1985 conquest of Everest, has not only pioneered ascents in Britain and the Alps but also authored seminal works such as 'Quest for Adventure' and 'Everest the Hard Way'. Robin Knox-Johnston, a distinguished mariner who commenced his career in the Merchant Navy, achieved renown as the first individual to undertake a solo circumnavigation of the world aboard his yacht Sunhaili, additionally shattering transatlantic records. Their collaboration culminated in a Greenland expedition, chronicled in their co-authored volume 'Sea, Ice and Rock'. This partnership was forged during an initial sailing excursion to Skye, where Bonnington instructed Knox-Johnston in climbing methodologies while receiving an introduction to nautical fundamentals, though Bonnington found the maritime aspects tedious and felt superfluous amidst the vessel's cramped confines. In Greenland, Bonnington shouldered the responsibility of leading perilous climbs, perpetually vigilant of the mutual hazards, while Knox-Johnston, though not a natural alpinist, exhibited profound trust and resilience. A minor discord emerged when Knox-Johnston neglected to rouse Bonnington for his watch, inciting feelings of insecurity that were swiftly ameliorated through dialogue. Ultimately, the expedition cemented a profound camaraderie, with Bonnington discerning Knox-Johnston's intrinsic benevolence and sensitivity beneath his rugged exterior."
214,"POWER DRESSING

EVERY SUMMER, the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world, where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? How do they get away with it? The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues of the Open University are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try, a century after Darwin's death, to settle the matter.
Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. That is, in a crowded and hence competitive world, the individuals best suited to the circumstances - the 'fittest' - are the most likely to survive and have offspring.
But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert. The peacocks tail, by contrast, was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance, and Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'. The driving mechanism was simply that females liked -- in his words - 'beauty for beauty's sake'.
But Darwin's friend and collaborator, Alfred Russel Wallace, though in many ways more 'romantic' than Darwin, was in others even more Darwinian. 'Beauty for beauty's sake' he wanted nothing of. If peahens chose cocks with the showiest trains, he felt, then it must be that they knew what they were about. The cocks must have some other quality, which was not necessarily obvious to the human observer, but which the hens themselves could appreciate. According to Wallace, then, the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.
Now, 100 years later, the wrangle is still unresolved, for the natural behaviour of peafowl is much harder to study than might be imagined. But 200
birds at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds yet are used to human beings, offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues at
Whipsnade have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
In practice, the mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.
But whether the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down. William Hamilton of Oxford University has put forward the hypothesis that showy male birds in general, of whatever species, are the most parasite-free, and that their plumage advertises their disease-free state. There is evidence that this is so in other birds. But Dr Petrie and her colleagues have not been able to assess the internal parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks to test this hypothesis. This year, however, she is comparing the offspring of cocks that have in the past proved attractive to hens with the offspring of cocks that hens find unattractive. Do the children of the attractive cocks grow faster? Are they more healthy? If so, then the females' choice will be seen to be utilitarian after all, just as Wallace predicted. 
There is a final twist to this continuing story. The great mathematician and biologist R A Fisher in the thirties proposed what has become known as 'Fisher's Runaway'. Just suppose, for example, that for whatever reason - perhaps for a sound 'Wallacian' reason a female first picks a male with a slightly better tail than the rest. The sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This is how the runaway begins. Within each generation, the males with the longest tails will get most mates and leave most offspring, and the females predilection for long tails will increase commensurately. Modern computer models show that such a feedback mechanism would alone be enough to produce a peacocks tail. Oddly, too, this would vindicate Darwin's apparently fanciful notion - once the process gets going, the females would indeed be selecting 'beauty for beauty's sake'.",C1,"Peacocks are birds with big, beautiful tails. In a park, they show their tails to female birds. Scientists watch them. They want to know why the females like the males with the best tails. Some scientists think the big tail means the male is healthy. Others think the females just like the beauty. They are still studying this.","Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park show their large tails to the hens. Scientists are studying why hens choose males with the most eye-spots on their tails. Darwin thought females pick males for beauty. Wallace thought the tail shows the male is strong and healthy. Now, scientists are checking if the offspring of attractive males grow faster and are healthier. This could explain the choice.","At Whipsnade Wild Animal Park, peacocks display their impressive tails to hens each summer. Researchers are investigating why hens prefer males with the most eye-spots, which relates to tail length. Darwin believed this was due to sexual selection, where females choose based on beauty. In contrast, Wallace argued that the tail indicates better survival traits, like being parasite-free. Current studies are examining if the children of attractive peacocks are healthier, supporting Wallace's idea. Additionally, Fisher's theory suggests that once females start preferring longer tails, this preference can escalate over generations, leading to extreme tails.","Annually, the peacocks residing in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park exhibit their ornate trains to the hens, prompting scientific inquiry into this phenomenon. Darwin proposed sexual selection as the mechanism, positing that females select mates for aesthetic reasons alone. Conversely, Wallace contended that such displays signal underlying qualities, such as reduced parasite load, which enhance survival. Investigations at Whipsnade confirm that hens favor males with a greater number of eye-spots. Researchers are now assessing whether the progeny of these preferred males demonstrate superior health and growth rates. Furthermore, Fisher's runaway selection theory illustrates how an initial preference for elongated tails could amplify through generational feedback, ultimately justifying Darwin's concept of beauty for its own sake.","POWER DRESSING

215,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West?

Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Some GPs, midwives and physios use it regularly for pain relief.

A. What's it all about? 

Traditional Chinese medicine sees health as a state in which the energy of the mind, body and spirit are in harmony. According to the theory, energy or Qi (pronounced chee) flows around the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each linked to an internal organ, and lots of tiny meridians take Qi to every cell. When the flow of Oi is upset, blocked or weakened, the body is said to be out of balance: weakness or illness may result. During a consultation with a traditional acupuncturist, he or she will try to find where imbalances occur in the Qi. This is done by feeling pulses on your wrist, examining your tongue and assessing your general appearance. He or she will ask about your medical history, current health, general well-being, state of mind, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin. He or she may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians, to stimulate the flow of Qi.

B. Over three hundred points
 
The points used for acupuncture are related to meridians so won't necessarily be near the site of the complaint. People often say they feel a not unpleasant dull ache or tingling sensation when the needle is gently manipulated. This is either done by hand or by attaching the needle to an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this sensation shows the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian.
There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

C. Science tells us how

Without accepting the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, doctors here have accepted that acupuncture can work for pain relief. This is because they have been able to provide scientific explanations of how it might work. For example: 
* It has been suggested that stimulating particular nerves blocks pain signals and stops them from reaching the brain.
* Some scientists believe that stimulating acupuncture points releases natural pain-relieving substances (endorphins).

D. What type of pain can be treated?

Many people with chronic long-term pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. Back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine and post-operative pain are commonly treated with acupuncture.
Other types of pain which acupuncturists claim to treat include menstrual pain, facial nerve pain and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

E. Modern use for an ancient treatment

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, one development has been rather more recent. The use of acupuncture instead of anaesthesia during surgery only started in the 1950s. It was this that helped to convince some doctors outside China that there was more to acupuncture than mind over matter.
In China today, acupuncture is used during all sorts of operations, from tonsillectomies to caesareans, and is even used in open heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation or with drugs. It's claimed that the pain is more or less eliminated, but it varies from person to person. It's hard to imagine many of us finding the option of lying awake on the operating table very attractive. But acupuncturists say that acupuncture anaesthesia involves none of the side-effects of conventional anaesthetics (e.g. nausea), and you recover from it more quickly.

F. Always effective

As with most complementary therapies, clinical trials to evaluate acupuncture are difficult to run. But trials that have been done have shown that 50 to 80 per cent of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally quote a similar success rate. They accept that it won't work for everyone and that people vary in their responsiveness.
Traditional acupuncturists say that for chronic long-term pain it will usually take between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief. But some improvement should be felt after just two or three visits.

G. A different approach to pain

But Western and Chinese medicine view pain rather differently. Like most alternative therapists, an acupuncturist views his or her patient in a holistic way. This means not just focusing on specific symptoms. An acupuncturist spends a long time making a diagnosis, trying to find underlying weaknesses in the Oi. He or she will also want to know what external factors are causing the pain. For instance, is the pain worse in the cold, heat, damp or wind? Does it feel sharp, dull, throbbing, constant or burning? These are seen as important factors in deciding how acupuncture can be used to treat the pain. It's unlikely that your average medical doctor would take such things into account, isn't it?

H. Traditional or not?

Some medical professionals do have traditional acupuncture training. Others - including many GPs who practise acupuncture reject traditional Chinese theory and subscribe to scientific explanations.
But many traditional acupuncturists believe that only by applying traditional Chinese medicine is it possible to bring about deep changes that lead to a longer cure - something that is very difficult to assess in trials.

Practitioners diagnose imbalances by examining pulses, the tongue, and overall condition, followed by the insertion of fine needles at meridian points to restore Qi, occasionally augmented with heat or pressure. With over three hundred primary points, acupuncture may elicit sensations like dull aches, attributed to engaging the Qi. Scientific explanations propose mechanisms such as nerve stimulation blocking pain signals or endorphin release. It is applied to various chronic pains, including back issues, arthritis, and migraines, and in China, it serves as an anesthetic in surgeries, offering advantages like reduced side effects and quicker recovery.

Care should always be taken in choosing an acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for funner investigation if necessary.","Acupuncture, an integral facet of traditional Chinese medicine with a history spanning two millennia, incorporates modalities such as herbalism, massage, dietary regimens, manipulative techniques, and physical exercises, and has garnered considerable recognition in Western medical circles primarily for its analgesic properties, employed by general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists. The philosophical underpinnings of traditional Chinese medicine conceptualize health as an equilibrium of mental, physical, and spiritual energies, wherein Qi circulates via meridians—twelve principal channels associated with internal organs, supplemented by innumerable minor pathways—and any perturbation, obstruction, or diminution in this flow precipitates disequilibrium and pathology. Diagnosis entails palpating radial pulses, inspecting the tongue, and evaluating general demeanor, complemented by inquiries into medical history, current well-being, and lifestyle factors, with therapeutic intervention involving the insertion of fine needles at precise meridian points, potentially enhanced by moxibustion or acupressure to modulate Qi. Over three hundred principal points exist, eliciting sensations described as not unpleasant dull aches or tingling upon needle manipulation, indicative of Qi engagement. Scientifically, mechanisms such as neural gate control inhibiting pain transmission or endorphin release have been postulated to explain its efficacy. Indications encompass a spectrum of chronic pain conditions, including spinal disorders, arthritic afflictions, cephalalgias, and postoperative discomfort, while in contemporary China, acupuncture anesthesia, pioneered in the 1950s, facilitates procedures from tonsillectomies to cardiothoracic surgeries, purportedly mitigating conventional anesthetic sequelae and expediting convalescence. Empirical studies, though methodologically challenging, suggest success rates of 50-80% for chronic pain management, typically necessitating a series of consultations. The holistic paradigm of acupuncture entails comprehensive diagnostic rigor, considering extrinsic influences and qualitative pain descriptors, diverging from reductionist Western models. Disparities in practitioner adherence to traditional tenets versus scientific rationales exist, emphasizing the imperative of selecting accredited practitioners who may facilitate referrals for ancillary medical evaluation."

powered law firm, finds himself manoeuvred into defending his boss's wife when she is tried for her husbands murder. The trial scenes are riveting, with the outcome in doubt right up to the verdict, and a really unexpected twist in the final pages. This is a terrific debut into a crowded genre.

BOOK B

Curtains for the Cardinal begins with a bang, and plunges the charismatic Sigismondo, troubleshooter for the aristocracy of the Italian Renaissance, into a turmoil of politics, clerical intrigue and high-wodety murder from which we are always confident he will emerge unscathed to disclose the guilty parties. The plot is convoluted and the book is about 50 pages overweight, but it is still great stuff.

BOOK C

File Under: Deceased introduces a refreshingly different new detective from a first novelist, Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector, ideally positioned, it seems, for a bit of investigating when a strange man falls dead at her feet. Undaunted by attacks from various quarters - perhaps tax inspectors are used to this sort of thing - and the disapproval of her handsome local detective sergeant, gutsy, versatile Leah is a winner in every way.

BOOK D

Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker sets that most literate of private investigators, Spenser, the job of assisting his friend Hawk to clear drug dealers out of a deprived estate in rundown Boston. The slick dialogue comes almost as fast as the bullets, but there are few corpses and more philosophy than usual. High-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

BOOK E

False Prophet by Faye Kellermann, features her usual pair of detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, investigating an attack and burglary at the house of a legendary film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and eye for odd human behaviour make this an entertaining mystery.

BOOK F

Husband and wife, Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, write as a team. Blood Red, Snow White features another lawyer, another female client, but the action is all outside the courtroom and the defender finds himself becoming the victim as the plot unravels. All the classic ingredients of romance, money and violence are mixed efficiently to produce an engrossing suspense novel.

BOOK G

Dead for a Ducat by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher in a new role, that of intended victim. The hilarious collection of characters are brought together to film the story of Robin Hood, but Philip isn't the only person to feel this is not the way his career should be developing. Simon Shaw never fails to entertain, but in moving his star actor from black comedy to farce, he gives a performance below his usual high standard.

BOOK H

Fall Down Easy is Lawrence Gough's best book for some time. Canadian police hunt a versatile bank robber who preys on female bank tellers. The slow, expertly-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the clever, disturbed robber raise this way above the average detective novel.",C1,"BOOK A: A lawyer must help his boss's wife.

217,"With the trees, I planted my stake in New Zealand

JONATHON PORRITT

TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER

Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'.
I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn't have any summers. I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot, which was great, because I like winter.
My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which 'the kids', my brother, sister and I, could look after. Mother said, 'If you can take the time and trouble to plant it with trees then you can have it.' The idea was that we would always have a stake in New Zealand, which is a lovely idea as my father was actually brought up there. And they found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. It's rather poor land, really, but it's quite good for planting trees on.
I've always been very keen and enthusiastic about land. I'd spent a year in Australia working on sheep stations and helping out in different farming jobs, and so the idea of planting trees sounded like a very nice idea, and I was immediately keen. I think the rest of the family got enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres.
In New Zealand in 1968 it was one of those winters. It rained an awful lot, endlessly in fact, and in a way it's idiotic to think back on it as such an immensely happy time as it rained pretty well most days that we were planting, and I don't suppose I've ever been wetter or colder for such a prolonged period.
There was a moment of truth every morning: getting ready for the next planting session. Coming out of the Land Rover relatively warm and dry, with the rain coming down, and your anorak still clammy from the day before, boots still sodden, hands fumbling with slippery laces.
'The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts, ideas and reflections about life.'
In that first year I had a guy to work with me who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful as I'd never planted trees seriously before all this. You have a planting bag around your neck which you fill with as many trees as you possibly can, and when your bag is full it's a nightmare, and it's only as it gets lighter that life gets easier.
In a way, the most difficult bit of the entire operation was getting the lines straight. You work out what spacing you're going to plant the trees at, and then you line up a series of three poles across as long a trajectory as you can get, and those poles then determine your lines. Once you're in line, you just plant all the way down the line till you get to the end, turn around and come back again. I enjoy hard physical work, and it certainly made me fit.
After a certain point you can plant trees almost on automatic, you become used to a rhythm, and you use the minimum number of spade strokes that you need to get the hole in the ground. The rhythm is something that everybody tells you about and, of course, it's true of many agricultural jobs that you actually have to train the body into a series of quite standardised moves, and then it becomes immensely easy: so you develop an absolutely regular process of taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it in, and moving on. Mentally, it's very interesting. The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts and ideas and reflections about life - a lot of my thinking about the natural world and our place in it, all of those things that have since dominated my life, first began to pop through my head in those days.
I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees gradually grow, which has been very satisfying when you actually planted the things and you do then have a kind of stake in what happens and how they prosper.
I always dread reading in the newspapers stories of another high wind in New Zealand, or Worst Drought Ever Hits New Zealand. Such headlines make me feel extremely apprehensive. However, it worked out extremely well and those trees are now 20 years old, and in good fettle.
The only postscript I should add is that I took a term off from teaching, and I went back there in 1984, completely on my own for three months. And I wrote my first book there, Seeing Green. There's a little cabin on the tree farm which is fantastically basic, just a bed, a table and a chair. In the mornings I would do my writing; in the afternoons I would go off and prune the trees, and then do research in the evenings.
The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong. In many respects it's the place that I feel most closely identified with in terms of that link between people and the earth: it's a most powerful bond.",C1,"I am Jonathon Porritt. I planted trees in New Zealand. My parents had an idea. They bought land. My brother, sister, and I could have the land if we planted trees. We planted trees from 1968 to 1972. It was 70 acres. It rained a lot. It was cold and wet. I worked with a man who knew how to plant trees. We used bags for the trees. We made straight lines for planting. I liked the hard work. It made me strong. I have gone back to New Zealand four times. I saw the trees grow. I feel happy about it. I worry when I hear about bad weather in New Zealand. In 1984, I went back alone. I wrote a book there. I feel a strong connection to that place.","Jonathon Porritt planted trees in New Zealand. His parents bought a small piece of land. They said he and his siblings could have it if they planted trees. This was because his father grew up in New Zealand. The land was near Auckland. It was not very good land, but it was good for trees. Jonathon liked the idea because he enjoyed working on farms. From 1968 to 1972, he, his brother, and sister planted all 70 acres. It rained a lot during that time, and it was very cold. He worked with an experienced tree-planter. They used bags to carry trees and made straight lines for planting. Jonathon found the physical work enjoyable and it kept him fit. He has visited New Zealand four times since then to see the trees grow. He feels worried when he hears about storms or droughts there. In 1984, he spent three months alone there and wrote his first book. He feels a strong bond with that place.","Jonathon Porritt describes planting trees in New Zealand. His parents purchased a plot of land so that he and his siblings could have a connection to the country, as his father was raised there. The land, located north of Auckland, was poor but suitable for trees. Jonathon was enthusiastic about the project due to his previous farming experience. Between 1968 and 1972, he, his brother, and sister planted the entire 70 acres. The weather was rainy and cold during the planting, making it challenging. He worked with an experienced tree-planter, using bags to carry seedlings and ensuring the rows were straight. Jonathon enjoyed the physical labor, which improved his fitness. He has returned to New Zealand four times to observe the trees' growth and feels anxious about extreme weather events there. In 1984, he took time off from teaching to spend three months alone on the land, where he wrote his first book. He maintains a powerful connection to the area, feeling it strengthens his bond with nature.","Jonathon Porritt recounts his experience of tree planting in New Zealand, initiated by his parents who bought a plot to give him and his siblings a lasting stake in the country, reflecting his father's upbringing there. The land, situated near Auckland, was of poor quality but ideal for afforestation. With prior agricultural work in Australia, Jonathon was immediately keen on the project. From 1968 to 1972, he and his siblings planted 70 acres, enduring persistent rain and cold conditions. Assisted by an expert tree-planter, they used planting bags and meticulous line-setting techniques to ensure straight rows. Jonathon found the strenuous work rewarding, enhancing his physical fitness and allowing for reflective thoughts about nature and human existence. He has revisited New Zealand multiple times to monitor the trees' development and feels apprehensive about adverse weather reports. In 1984, he dedicated three months to solitude there, composing his inaugural book, which deepened his profound connection to the land and its ecological significance.","With the trees, I planted my stake in New Zealand

They acquired a tract north of Auckland, albeit of inferior quality, yet amenable to sylvan cultivation. Owing to his antecedent engagements on Australian sheep stations, Porritt was instantly enamored with the proposition. From 1968 to 1972, he, in concert with his siblings, afforested the entire 70 acres, braving interminable precipitation and frigid climes. Under the tutelage of a seasoned tree-planter, they employed planting sacks and devised rectilinear alignments via poles to optimize precision. Porritt relished the arduous physical exertion, which not only augmented his vigor but also induced a meditative state, fostering nascent contemplations on humanity's nexus with the natural world—ideations that would later pervade his ethos. He has since made quadrennial peregrinations to witness the arboreal maturation, evincing trepidation at meteorological adversities. In 1984, he absconded from pedagogical duties for a trimensual sojourn in solitude, authoring his seminal tome there, thereby cementing an indissoluble bond with the terrain and its ecological import."
218,"The long-distance runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. This gorgeous, if lonely and isolated, spot is Nanyuk: for the past three years it has been my base for mid-winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands.
But not once on those trips had I trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil. On my fourth and most recent winter training trip to Kenya, however, I broke a personal tradition. I both competed in my first-ever race in Kenya's oxygen-thin air and stayed at Kenya's national team training camp, which is where the country's top runners prepare for their annual assault on the World Cross-Country Team Championships.
I was invited by Kenya's national team coach when I finished fifth - behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan - in the World Championship 1O,000 meters race. It was an opponunity not to be missed. Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity.
These benefits have been borne out by the successes of generations of Kenyan runners.
My first African race - which came before my spell at the Kenyan team training camp - was also a first for the whole continent. Held in Nairobi, it was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil.
If nothing else, it was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but 3 were Kenyan. And I honestly felt I hadn't had a bad race!
However, I don't believe Kenyan success can entirely be put down to the altitude factor. Kenyan runners are also noted for their refreshingly uncomplicated approach to the sport. While their running style is seemingly effortless, their diet simple and their manner of conversation relaxed, they also seem to love competing.
But the least discussed aspect of the puzzle of Kenyan success was perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp soon provided the answers.
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.
It's a fairly basic affair, though: there are few comforts. The athletes live among the college's regular students and are housed six to a room in cinder-block dormitories.
The athletes' days at the camp are dominated by three work-outs: a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, followed by a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily regime began at six. We crawled from our bunks and assembled to be briefed by the coaches for the morning run.
""Run easy, you have a hard job today"", we were warned as we left by the coach who'd invited me.
The total distance covered each day was about 40 kilometres - a little short of a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, with just the one scheduled run of 20 kilometres, which certainly came as a welcome respite from the rest of the week's three daily work-outs.
Running apart, life was complication-free. A splash of water on the face and a brush of the teeth sufficed for pre-breakfast preparations. Breakfast itself consisted of tea, bread and boiled eggs, taken in a sparsely-lit, small dining area.
Lunch and dinner both had a similar menu: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach and tea. When the day's running was over, in the early evening, we would pile into a car and drive down to bathe properly in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.
By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. That success just can't be attributed to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone.
I couldn't stop myself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps these are the secrets, perhaps these are the real reasons behind Kenya's rise to the top of world distance running.",C1,A man named Richard Nerurkar is a runner from Britain. He runs long distances. He went to Kenya to train. Kenya is a country in Africa. He trained with Kenyan runners. They train high up on a mountain. The air is thin there. This helps runners get better. Richard ran in a race in Kenya. Many Kenyan runners were faster than him. The Kenyan runners live simply. They eat simple food like bread and eggs. They train hard every day. They run a lot. Richard thinks their simple life and hard work make them great runners.,"Richard Nerurkar is a British runner who runs 10,000 meters. He visited a training camp in Kenya. The camp is on Mount Kenya, a high mountain. Richard trained with Kenyan runners for the first time. He also ran in a race in Kenya. Many Kenyan runners finished before him. Training at high altitude helps because it makes more red blood cells. This helps carry oxygen better. Kenyan runners are successful. They have a simple lifestyle. They eat basic food like ugali and stew. They train three times a day, running about 40 kilometers. Richard believes their success comes from hard training and a simple life, not just the altitude.","Richard Nerurkar, a top British 10,000-meter runner, traveled to Kenya's high-altitude training camp near Mount Kenya. On his fourth visit, he broke his routine by training with Kenyan athletes and competing in his first race in Africa. He finished behind many Kenyans, which was a humbling experience. Training at altitude increases red blood cells, improving oxygen capacity, which contributes to Kenyan runners' success. However, Richard thinks other factors are important, such as their straightforward approach to running, simple diet, and love for competition. At the camp, athletes lived in basic dormitories and followed a strict daily schedule with three workouts totaling around 40 kilometers. Richard concluded that Kenya's dominance in distance running stems from their grueling training, passion, and uncomplicated mountain lifestyle, not just genetics or altitude.","Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's elite 10,000-meter runners, visited the Kenyan high-altitude training camp in Nanyuki, situated on the slopes of Mount Kenya. During his most recent trip, he departed from tradition by training alongside Kenyan runners on their home ground and participating in his inaugural race in Kenya's oxygen-thin atmosphere. He was invited by the national coach after a World Championship performance. Although altitude training enhances red blood cell production and oxygen transport, evidenced by Kenyan successes, Richard contends that their achievement cannot be solely attributed to this factor. Kenyan athletes are renowned for their effortless running style, simplistic diet, and relaxed demeanor, yet they possess a profound enthusiasm for competition. Residing in spartan dormitories at St Mark's College, the athletes adhered to a rigorous regimen of three daily workouts covering approximately 40 kilometers, with only a slight reduction on Sundays. Richard reflected that the purity of their mountainous existence, combined with demanding training and an ardent drive for victory, fundamentally underpins Kenya's ascendancy in global distance running.","The long-distance runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. This gorgeous, if lonely and isolated, spot is Nanyuk: for the past three years it has been my base for mid-winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands.
But not once on those trips had I trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil. On my fourth and most recent winter training trip to Kenya, however, I broke a personal tradition. I both competed in my first-ever race in Kenya's oxygen-thin air and stayed at Kenya's national team training camp, which is where the country's top runners prepare for their annual assault on the World Cross-Country Team Championships.
I was invited by Kenya's national team coach when I finished fifth - behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan - in the World Championship 1O,000 meters race. It was an opponunity not to be missed. Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity.
These benefits have been borne out by the successes of generations of Kenyan runners.
My first African race - which came before my spell at the Kenyan team training camp - was also a first for the whole continent. Held in Nairobi, it was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil.
If nothing else, it was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but 3 were Kenyan. And I honestly felt I hadn't had a bad race!
However, I don't believe Kenyan success can entirely be put down to the altitude factor. Kenyan runners are also noted for their refreshingly uncomplicated approach to the sport. While their running style is seemingly effortless, their diet simple and their manner of conversation relaxed, they also seem to love competing.
But the least discussed aspect of the puzzle of Kenyan success was perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp soon provided the answers.
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.
It's a fairly basic affair, though: there are few comforts. The athletes live among the college's regular students and are housed six to a room in cinder-block dormitories.
The athletes' days at the camp are dominated by three work-outs: a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, followed by a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily regime began at six. We crawled from our bunks and assembled to be briefed by the coaches for the morning run.
""Run easy, you have a hard job today"", we were warned as we left by the coach who'd invited me.
The total distance covered each day was about 40 kilometres - a little short of a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, with just the one scheduled run of 20 kilometres, which certainly came as a welcome respite from the rest of the week's three daily work-outs.
Running apart, life was complication-free. A splash of water on the face and a brush of the teeth sufficed for pre-breakfast preparations. Breakfast itself consisted of tea, bread and boiled eggs, taken in a sparsely-lit, small dining area.
Lunch and dinner both had a similar menu: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach and tea. When the day's running was over, in the early evening, we would pile into a car and drive down to bathe properly in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.
By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. That success just can't be attributed to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone.
I couldn't stop myself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps these are the secrets, perhaps these are the real reasons behind Kenya's rise to the top of world distance running.","Richard Nerurkar, a distinguished British 10,000-metre runner, sojourned at the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp, nestled in Nanyuki along the ascent to glacier-capped Mount Kenya. Eschewing prior customs on his fourth winter expedition, he immersed himself in training with Kenyan athletes on their native terrain and debuted in a race amidst Africa's rarefied air, an event that marked the continent's first international cross-country competition. His invitation ensued from a fifth-place finish in a World Championship race, behind predominantly Kenyan adversaries. While altitude conditioning augments erythrocyte production, thereby elevating oxygen-carrying capacity—a phenomenon corroborated by generations of Kenyan triumphs—Nerurkar posits that their preeminence transcends mere physiological adaptations. Kenyan runners exhibit an uncomplicated ethos towards the sport, characterized by a seemingly effortless gait, austere dietary habits, and a convivial yet competitive spirit. At the national team encampment within St Mark's College, athletes endured ascetic accommodations and a relentless daily itinerary comprising three strenuous sessions, cumulatively spanning nearly a marathon's distance. Nerurkar ultimately deduced that the quintessence of Kenyan supremacy lies in the symbiotic interplay of their spartan highland existence, arduous training protocols, and an insatiable passion for excellence, rather than isolated factors such as genetics or altitude alone."
219,"ECCENTRICS

An eccentric is by definition someone whose behaviour is abnormal, someone who refuses to conform to the accepted norms of his society. This, of course, immediately begs the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us, after all, have our quirks and oddities. It may be a passion for entering newspaper competitions, a compulsion for collecting beer mats, a tendency to write indignant letters to the press on every conceivable subject. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. Within most of us that urge is constantly in conflict with the contrary force. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity and in most of us it is conformity that is the more powerful. The desire to be accepted, loved, appreciated, to feel at one with our fellows, is stronger than the desire to stand out in the crowd, to be our own man, to do our own thing.
Notice, for example, how people who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour, tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems. The important word is 'common'. They look for other people with whom they can share what in the normal run of events is regarded by relatives, friends and neighbours as an oddity. A crowd, even a small crowd, is reassuring.
Probably all of us recognise a tension within ourselves between the two forces of individualism and conformity, for at the same time that most of us are going with the crowd, we tend to resent any suggestion that this is what we are doing. We feel a self-conscious need to assert our individuality as when the belligerent man at the bar informs his small audience, ""Well, I say what I think."" Or the wary stranger to whom we have just been introduced announces, ""You must take me as you find me. I don't stand on ceremony.""
Any of us can, at any time, reverse this trend. We can stoke the boiler of individualism, assert our own personality. Many people have made it to the top in their chosen professions, basically by doing just that. One example is Bob Dylan, the American singer, who has gone on record as saying, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk. But that self-conscious assertion of individuality is not eccentricity, at least not in the early stages. When a pop singer deliberately wears bizarre clothes to gain publicity, or a society hostess makes outrageous comments about her guests in order to get herself noticed in the gossip columns, that is not eccentricity. However, if the pop star and the society hostess perpetuate such activities until they become a part of themselves, until they are no longer able to return to what most of us consider 'normal behaviour', then they certainly would qualify. For the most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics are not people who deliberately try to be odd, they simply are odd.
The true eccentric is not merely indifferent to public opinion, he is scarcely conscious at all. He simply does what he does, because of who he is. And this marks the eccentric as essentially different from, for example, enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists and recluses. These people are all very conscious of the world around them. Much of what they do, they do in reaction to the world in which they live. Some wish to make an impression on society, some wish to escape from society, but all are very much aware of society. The eccentric alone goes on his merry way regardless.",C1,An eccentric person is someone who acts in a way that is not normal. They do not follow the rules of their group. Most people have small strange habits. But they also want to be liked by others. Eccentric people do not try to be different. They are just different. They do not care what others think. They are not like people who want to show off or run away from society.,"An eccentric is a person whose behavior is not normal and who does not follow society's rules.

This makes them different from people who do things to get attention or avoid society. For example, some people join clubs to share their unusual interests with others.","An eccentric is defined as someone with abnormal behavior who refuses to conform to societal norms. While most people have peculiarities, they often feel a conflict between being individual and fitting in. Eccentrics, however, act naturally without trying to be odd and are largely unaware of public opinion. This distinguishes them from others, such as enthusiasts or exhibitionists, who are very conscious of society. People with unusual hobbies might form groups to share their interests, seeking reassurance from like-minded individuals.","An eccentric is characterized by abnormal behavior and a refusal to adhere to accepted societal norms. Although many individuals experience an internal tension between individualism and conformity, eccentrics assert their individuality naturally, without deliberate effort. They are scarcely conscious of public opinion, unlike enthusiasts or exhibitionists who react to societal pressures. For instance, those with unconventional interests may congregate in clubs to discuss shared enthusiasms, yet true eccentricity stems from an innate disposition rather than a desire for attention or escape.","ECCENTRICS

This intrinsic peculiarity distinguishes them from figures such as enthusiasts or exhibitionists, who remain acutely aware of and reactive to their social milieu. Eccentricity thus emanates from an uncontrived essence, transcending mere nonconformity to embody a state of being wherein societal appraisal holds negligible sway."
220,"Photographing People

People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

A. GROUPING PEOPLE

Avoid straight lines in group shots. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels. Otherwise, have some of the group sitting or kneeling at the front so that you can see all the faces, or raise your own viewpoint.

B. POSING FOR PICTURES

People seldom act naturally in front of the camera. Often they stiffen up and the pose becomes rather wooden. Relax your subject by helping him to find a comfortable position. You might suggest he folds his hands or puts them in his pockets.

C. THE RIGHT APPROACH

Never try to pretend that you are not taking a picture of someone when it is clear that you are as this only creates tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to have their picture taken - perhaps after some initial protestations - and are quite flattered by it. But they are likely to become rather self-conscious and you may need to direct them. A picture can be spoiled by the fact that the subject is looking rather aimlessly out of the picture so that the interest lies elsewhere.

D. EYE CONTACT

A picture gains immediate impact if the subject appears to be looking at the viewer of the picture. Ask your subject to look into the lens - not necessarily to smile as well -- and this is the effect you will get. The subject may not be able to do this for too long: he may become self-conscious or be distracted by someone nearby. So remind him once more, just before you release the shutter. Or try saying something funny or unexpected as you take the shot for a genuine reaction rather than a meaningless stare.

E. CANDID CONCENTRATION

An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to concentrate on something within the picture area. Your subject might find this easier to do, and the viewer can follow the attention to another part of the picture. You get the impression that you are observing the subject unnoticed. Candid shots have a special fascination and the subject's expression is vital to the picture.

F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES

Expressions and the gestures that go with them tell us more about the subject of a photograph than anything else. Even if he is obviously badly treated and hungry, a laughing child provokes a smile from the viewer, whereas a sad expression produces a sympathetic sadness in the viewer, however apparently comfortable the subject may be. Look for familiar expressions for your portraits: shrugs, winks, anger, tears, thumbs-up, fist-clenching and so on. They are an instant visual language.

G. SITUATION INTEREST

Though shots which isolate a figure or face prominently have great impact, the subject's background or environment can add extra interest and information about the subject. When using a background in this way, try to exclude details that are not relevant to the subject or blur them by focusing selectively. Make sure that the subject is not overwhelmed by the background - a wide-angle lens will make your subject appear relatively larger by comparison with the background.

H. INTERACTION

Wherever two or more people are talking, arguing, haggling, joking or working together, there are opportunities for good pictures. Couples make appealing shots; so do mothers and babies, teachers and children or teams of people working or playing a sport. Look out especially for contact between the subjects - either eye-contact or physical contact, like a protective hand on the arm or a handshake. Or show how one is reacting to another by waiting for an animated expression or telling gesture.

I. PEOPLE AND PLACES

Many pictures of people are taken on holiday or during an outing - partly to show the place they were visiting. A little care will greatly improve this type of picture. To show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building (or mountain, or lake) in the frame. Ask your subjects to come fairly close to the camera and compose the picture so that the group forms a foreground interest without obscuring the background. If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be far easier to do. A good picture will show a balance between the subjects and the place they were visiting, so that both claim an equal share of the viewer's attention.

J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?

In answer to this question, first decide why you want to take the picture. If you are taking a picture to remember someone by someone you may have met briefly on holiday, for example - then you will want a good clear picture and it would be worth asking the subject to pose against a well-chosen background. Pictures of the family, on the other hand, can be very tedious if they are a succession of formal poses in front of places of interest. Candid pictures of events as they happen are far more lively, and you are more likely to get unselfconscious shots when you know the subject well. A picture taken on the spur of the moment will jog the family memory in future years far better than a posed portrait.",C1,"Taking photos of people is fun. People make photos better. But it is hard to take good photos of people. You need to think about how they stand and look. The camera can make people act strange. For groups, do not put people in a straight line. Have them stand in different ways. Some can sit or kneel. For one person, help them feel relaxed. Tell them to put hands in pockets. Do not hide that you are taking a photo. Most people like it. Ask them to look at the camera. This makes the photo strong. Or, have them look at something in the photo. This can be easier. Faces and hands show feelings. A happy face makes us happy. A sad face makes us sad. The place behind the person can tell a story. Do not let the background be too big. When people are together, take photos of them talking or playing. On holiday, take photos of people with the place. Put people close to the camera and the place behind them. Sometimes, ask people to pose for a clear photo. Other times, take photos when they are not looking for natural pictures.","People are very interesting subjects for photography. A photo with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people well is difficult. Besides technical skills, you must pay attention to their actions, gestures, and expressions. Often, the camera makes people act unnaturally. In group photos, avoid straight lines. Have people stand at various angles and distances, or on different levels. You can have some sit or kneel in front to see all faces, or raise your camera higher. When posing individuals, they often become stiff. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding hands or putting them in pockets. Be honest about taking their photo; hiding it causes tension. Most people agree to be photographed and feel flattered, but they may need direction. For impact, ask the subject to look into the camera lens. This creates a connection with the viewer. If they can't do this long, remind them just before taking the shot. Alternatively, have them focus on something in the photo for a candid effect. Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about the person. A laughing child makes viewers smile, while a sad one evokes sympathy. Include familiar expressions like shrugs or winks. The background can add interest but should not overwhelm the subject; use a wide-angle lens to make the person stand out. When people interact, such as talking or working together, it's a good chance for photos. Look for eye contact or physical touch. On outings, show people against relevant backgrounds by positioning them close to the camera and including the scene. Decide whether to pose based on the purpose: posed photos are good for clear memories, while candid shots are more lively for family events.","People are the most fascinating subjects in photography. A photograph that includes a person is typically more compelling than one without human presence. Nevertheless, capturing people effectively is challenging. Beyond technical and artistic aspects, the photographer must be aware of actions, gestures, and expressions. Frequently, the camera's presence negatively affects these elements. For group photographs, avoid arranging people in straight lines. Instead, position them at different angles and distances, and if possible, on varying levels. Alternatively, have some individuals sit or kneel at the front to ensure all faces are visible, or elevate your own viewpoint. When people pose for pictures, they often become rigid and unnatural. To relax your subject, assist them in finding a comfortable stance, such as by suggesting they fold their hands or place them in pockets. Do not attempt to conceal that you are photographing someone, as this can create tension or hostility. Most subjects will consent to being photographed—perhaps after initial reluctance—and may feel flattered, but they might require guidance. A picture can be ruined if the subject gazes aimlessly away, diverting interest. To achieve immediate impact, have the subject look directly into the camera lens; this engages the viewer. If the subject struggles with this, remind them just before taking the photo, or provoke a genuine reaction with a humorous comment. As an alternative, direct the subject's concentration to something within the frame for a candid shot, allowing the viewer to follow their attention. Expressions and accompanying gestures are crucial, conveying emotions like happiness or sadness through familiar actions such as shrugs or winks. The background can enhance the image by providing context, but irrelevant details should be excluded or blurred, and a wide-angle lens can prevent the subject from being overshadowed. Interactions between people, such as conversations or teamwork, offer excellent photographic opportunities, especially with eye or physical contact. In travel photos, balance the subjects with their environment by using a standard or wide-angle lens and positioning the group prominently without blocking the background. Decide on posing based on intent: posed shots are suitable for clear mementos, while candid captures are more dynamic for familiar subjects.","Individuals constitute the most intriguing subjects in photography. An image featuring a person is almost invariably more engaging than an identical scene devoid of human interest. However, photographing people proficiently presents considerable difficulties. In addition to technical and artistic considerations, the photographer must remain attentive to actions, gestures, and facial expressions. Often, the mere presence of the camera can detrimentally influence these aspects. When composing group shots, eschew straight-line formations. Instruct participants to assume varied angles and distances, and if feasible, utilize different elevations. Alternatively, arrange for some members to sit or kneel at the forefront to ensure all faces are discernible, or adopt a higher vantage point. In posed photography, subjects frequently exhibit stiffness, resulting in unnatural stances. Alleviate this by assisting them in attaining a comfortable posture, perhaps by proposing they fold their arms or insert hands into pockets. Avoid feigning that you are not photographing someone when it is evident, as this fosters tension and potential hostility. Most individuals will acquiesce to being photographed—possibly after some initial objections—and may even feel complimented, though they might require direction to avoid self-consciousness. A photograph can be compromised if the subject gazes vacantly outside the frame, thereby shifting the focus away. To imbue an image with immediate impact, direct the subject to look into the lens; this establishes a connection with the viewer, irrespective of whether they smile. If maintaining eye contact proves challenging, reiterate the instruction just before capturing the image, or elicit an authentic reaction by uttering something amusing or unexpected. Conversely, for a candid approach, have the subject concentrate on an element within the picture area, facilitating a sense of unobtrusive observation for the viewer. Facial expressions and concomitant gestures are paramount, as they communicate the subject's emotional state more effectively than any other element; for instance, a jovial child elicits smiles, whereas a sorrowful countenance evokes empathy. Seek out recognizable expressions such as shrugs, winks, or clenched fists, which serve as an instantaneous visual lexicon. Although isolated portraits possess significant impact, incorporating the subject's environment can augment interest and provide contextual information. When employing a background, eliminate irrelevant details or blur them through selective focus, and ensure the subject is not dwarfed by the surroundings—a wide-angle lens can accentuate the subject relative to the background. Interactions among people, whether conversing, bargaining, or collaborating, yield fertile ground for compelling imagery, particularly when capturing eye contact or physical touch like a protective hand. In travel photography, depict individuals against pertinent backdrops by using standard or wide-angle lenses and positioning the group proximately to the camera while framing the scene comprehensively. The decision to pose or not should hinge on the photograph's purpose: posed images are apt for clear remembrances of acquaintances, whereas candid shots, seized spontaneously, offer greater vitality and authenticity, especially with familiar subjects.","Photographing People

If you are taking a picture to remember someone by someone you may have met briefly on holiday, for example - then you will want a good clear picture and it would be worth asking the subject to pose against a well-chosen background. Pictures of the family, on the other hand, can be very tedious if they are a succession of formal poses in front of places of interest. Candid pictures of events as they happen are far more lively, and you are more likely to get unselfconscious shots when you know the subject well. A picture taken on the spur of the moment will jog the family memory in future years far better than a posed portrait.","Human subjects are unequivocally the most captivating in the realm of photography; an image incorporating a person is almost invariably more compelling than an identical composition lacking human presence. Nonetheless, achieving proficiency in photographing individuals is fraught with challenges. Beyond the requisite technical and artistic acumen, the photographer must remain acutely conscious of actions, gestures, and expressions, as the camera's intrusion can often exert a deleterious effect on these elements. In the context of group photography, eschew linear arrangements; instead, orchestrate subjects to assume disparate angles and distances, and if practicable, utilize varying elevations. Alternatively, position some participants in seated or kneeling postures at the foreground to ensure facial visibility, or elevate the photographic viewpoint. When individuals are posed, they frequently manifest rigidity, resulting in stilted depictions; mitigate this by facilitating a relaxed demeanor, perhaps by suggesting hand-folding or pocket placement. Abstain from dissembling about photographic intent when it is transparent, as such subterfuge only engenders tension and potential animosity. Most subjects will accede to being photographed—perhaps subsequent to initial demurrals—and may even experience flattery, though they might necessitate guidance to circumvent self-consciousness. A photograph can be vitiated if the subject's gaze is directed extraneously, thereby dissipating the focal interest. To confer immediate impact, instruct the subject to regard the lens directly, thereby forging a connection with the viewer, irrespective of concomitant smiling. Should sustained ocular engagement prove untenable, reiterate the directive immediately prior to shutter release, or provoke an unfeigned reaction through an unexpected or humorous interjection. As an alternative, direct the subject's concentration toward an element within the pictorial frame for a candid effect, permitting the viewer to trace the attention and fostering an impression of unobserved scrutiny. Expressions and their concomitant gestures are paramount, conveying the subject's essence more profoundly than any other attribute; for instance, a mirthful child, even in adversity, evokes viewer delight, whereas a dolorous visage elicits sympathy regardless of apparent comfort. Incorporate familiar expressions—such as shrugs, winks, or fist-clenching—as they constitute an instantaneous visual vernacular. Although portraits that isolate figures possess considerable potency, the ambient background can imbue additional interest and contextual intelligence; when leveraging the environment, excise irrelevant particulars or obfuscate them via selective focus, and ensure the subject is not subsumed by the milieu—a wide-angle lens can accentuate the subject proportionally. Interactions among individuals, whether in discourse, negotiation, or collaboration, present fertile opportunities for imagery, particularly when capturing ocular or physical contact, such as a protective gesture. In travel photography, depict subjects against pertinent backdrops by employing standard or wide-angle lenses and positioning the group in proximate foreground without occluding the environment, ideally from a slightly elevated perspective to achieve equilibrium between subject and locale. The dichotomy of posing versus candid capture should be resolved by the photograph's objective: posed images are apposite for lucid mementos of transient acquaintances, whereas spontaneous shots, seized in medias res, proffer greater vivacity and unselfconscious authenticity, especially with familiar subjects, thereby more effectively galvanizing familial recollection in posterity."

A.
The career of citizen Tristan Smith, set in the fictional republic of Efica, is an extraordinary parable of human power, history and humour. In a feat of considerable literary skill, the author has created a world with its own history, traditions and customs.
The book is notable also for its humour, and for the author's unique vision, which is here combined with his penetrating psychological insight in a novel which is difficult but rewarding.

B. 
Harriet is poised and middle-class, with an architect husband and her own business. 
Ordinarily, she would never have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who looks after her ageing father and has brought up her grandson, Leo, since he was three.
Their lives are shattered when the teenage Leo viciously attacks Harriets son, Joe, in the street. After the court case both boys refuse to talk about what happened. Leo, who had been a model pupil and had never been involved in a fight before, will not explain what came over him, while Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is tortured by the effect on her son and ministering to him takes over her life. Sheila is so wracked with guilt that she requests a meeting - from which their unusual friendship grows.
The great strength of the author has always been in depicting how people react to upheaval in their lives. He also captures the mothers sense that, no matter how hard she tries, she can never do enough.

C.
Shortlisted for the Booker prize, this book follows the fortunes of one of the most isolated of the Scottish Orkney islands and its inhabitants over a long and uneventful rural history.
The book sets this narrative against pertinent moments in Scottish history, as vividly imagined in the daydreams of the young protagonist, Throfinn
Ragnarson, who disappears abruptly at one point in the book, only to return after the Second World War, having now learnt to appreciate the simplicity of his worthy ancestors lives.

Following his recent blockbuster success, the author has produced a sequel resonant with the same gentle irony and acid observations of family life which made its predecessor so appealing.
Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her spirited companion, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life remains the same winning combination of vanity, charm and reluctant kindness, and Rosie provides an ally in her continuing and highly enjoyable manipulation of both suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora is forced to acknowledge the passage of time that brings a new generation to centre stage.
The author is skilful at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events.

222,"The day I drew Picasso

Richard Cork recalls how, as an 78-year-old student, he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century.

Even seen at a distance, eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour, Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student, filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. Having run out of money, I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront. But I spent much of the time drawing, and was lucky enough to be carrying an ample sketchbook when my encounter with the octogenarian artist took place.
Picasso was known to be a fairly reclusive figure who spent most of his time shut away working high in the hills. So I was doubly astonished to find him seated at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three companions. Without my friend's prompting, I would never have dared to walk over and ask for his signature. Nor did I imagine, as I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, that he would comply.
But my request was generously granted. Taking the large sheet I passed over, Picasso inscribed his name across the top of the paper. Then, as if unable to resist the blankness below, he added an exuberant linear flourish on the rest of the page. But Pcasso's art, even at its least representational, was usually anchored in observed reality. So the curves may well refer to a cloud, the wind-rippled sea or the shape assumed by Cannes harbour, dominating his lunchtime vantage point.
Delighted, I thanked him and embarked on a halting conversation. Since Picasso's English was even poorer than my French, an extravagantly dressed American woman at the table acted as our interpreter. She kept describing him as the Maestro, and it was difficult to combat her gushing interjections. But I did manage to tell Picasso of my voracious interest in art and my admiration for his work.
After a while, I resumed to the boat and proudly displayed the fruit of my visit. But the friend who had encouraged me to introduce myself to Picasso could see that the lunch party was still in progress. 'Is that all?' he asked, looking at the signature. 'Why on earth don't you go back and make the most of it? You won't get a chance like this again - and he probably wouldn't mind if you drew his portrait.'
Sketchbook under arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it wise not to ask him whether he'd mind having his portrait drawn: a refusal at this stage might have wrecked the whole delicate enterprise. So I simply stood by the table, propped my pad against an ironwork screen, got out a stick of crayon and stayed to draw.
Once he noticed, Picasso grinned like an imp and made my task wickedly difficult. He acted out a range of expressions, both ridiculous and macabre - rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue and brandishing his hand in fantastical shapes on either side of his forehead. The entire performance was carried out with the gusto of an instinctive clown.
I was tempted to give up the struggle, but the sheer high spirits of my playful sitter seemed tantamount to a challenge. However obstructive his antics, I felt that he was testing my persistence, in order, perhaps, to discover the true extent of my determination.
As if to bear this out, Picasso at last relented and lapsed into repose. For a few extraordinary minutes, he deliberately gave me the chance to study him without impediment. I noticed how tough and alert he appeared, still taut in a blue-and-white striped jersey. As compact as a wrestler, the deeply tanned figure resembled an athletic 60-year-old rather than a man who would soon be celebrating his 84th birthday.
I marvelled at the youthfulness of his clear, dark eyes, set with startling intensity in features remarkably unencumbered by the folds of slack flesh on so many elderly faces. The eyes were mesmerising, and I tried to give them the necessary forcefulness. After fastening themselves on whatever they wanted to scrutinise, they did not blink until the unwavering gaze moved elsewhere.
He also seemed curiously removed and alone, even though there was plenty of company nearby. His engaging burst of buffoonery could not disguise an underlying gravity of spirit. Content to let his friends do most of the talking, he sat in a very private and absorbed silence, pursuing his own isolated interests undisturbed.
When the American lady told me that the Maestro wanted to see his portrait, I became embarrassed and replied that it wasn't good enough to show him. Picasso insisted, however, and after I passed my sketchbook over, he gave my efforts a generous nod.
Then, to my astonishment, he announced that it was now his turn. I lost no time in giving him my crayon, and his hand applied a few swift, decisive strokes to the paper. In a matter of seconds, with beguiling assurance, he outlined a bearded face below the head which had taken me so many anxious minutes to produce.
He handed the pad back, and there was a drawing blithely at odds with my dogged strivings. Picasso had moved one eye onto my nose, and summarised my smile in a single, irresistibly vivacious line. I looked like a creature who had strayed from one of his more lighthearted mythological compositions. Perhaps he saw me as an intruder from another world, peering in at him with all the gauche curiosity of a young man amazed to find himself face-to-face with an artist he venerated.
I thanked Picasso, and asked him if he would be kind enough to sign the drawing. After consultation, the American explained that the Maestro says you already have his signature. So there were limits to the generosity he was prepared to bestow on me!
All the same, I look back now and wonder at my good fortune. Meeting Picasso and, more important, receiving his attention meant an enormous amount to me.",C1,I met Picasso. I was a young student. I saw him in a restaurant. I asked for his name. He wrote his name for me. Then he drew a picture. I was happy. I talked to him. A woman helped us talk. I told him I liked his art. My friend said I should draw him. I went back and drew Picasso. He made funny faces. It was hard to draw him. Then he sat still. I drew his face. He looked young and strong. He had dark eyes. He saw my drawing. He liked it. Then he drew me. He drew my face fast. It looked funny. I asked him to sign it. He said no. I was lucky to meet him.,"I met Picasso when I was a young student traveling in Europe. I saw him eating lunch in Cannes. I went to him and asked for his signature. He wrote his name and added a drawing. I was very happy. We talked with help from an American woman. I told him I admired his art. My friend said I should draw Picasso's picture. I went back and drew him. He made many funny faces, which made it difficult. Then he sat quietly, and I drew his face. He looked strong and young for his age. His eyes were intense. He saw my drawing and liked it. Then he drew a quick picture of me. It was a funny drawing with one eye on my nose. I asked him to sign it, but he said no. I feel lucky to have met him.","As a young student traveling in Europe, I met Picasso in Cannes. I saw him at a restaurant and, encouraged by a friend, I approached him for his signature. He kindly signed my sketchbook and added a lively drawing. We had a conversation through an interpreter, and I expressed my great interest in his art. Later, my friend suggested I draw Picasso's portrait. I returned and began drawing without asking permission. Picasso made it challenging by acting out various expressions, but eventually he sat still, allowing me to capture his youthful and alert appearance. After I finished, he looked at my drawing and approved it. Then, he quickly drew a humorous portrait of me, moving one eye onto my nose. When I asked him to sign this drawing, he refused, saying I already had his signature. Reflecting on this, I consider myself very fortunate to have had this experience with such a famous artist.","During my travels as a young student, I encountered Picasso at a restaurant in Cannes. Overcoming my nervousness, I asked for his autograph, and he not only signed my sketchbook but also added an exuberant drawing. Through an interpreter, I conveyed my deep admiration for his work. Spurred by a friend, I returned to draw his portrait. Picasso initially made the task difficult with playful antics, but then he settled into a pose, revealing a vigorous and intense demeanor that belied his age. After I completed the sketch, he inspected it favorably and then produced a swift, whimsical portrait of me, distorting my features in a lighthearted manner. When I requested his signature on this new drawing, he declined, indicating that I had already received one. This encounter left me with a profound sense of luck and appreciation for the attention he gave me.","The day I drew Picasso

Once he noticed, Picasso grinned like an imp and made my task wickedly difficult. He acted out a range of expressions, both ridiculous and macabre - rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue and brandishing his hand in fantastical shapes on either side of his forehead. The entire performance was carried out with the gusto of an instinctive clown.
I was tempted to give up the struggle, but the sheer high spirits of my playful sitter seemed tantamount to a challenge. However obstructive his antics, I felt that he was testing my persistence, in order, perhaps, to discover the true extent of my determination.
As if to bear this out, Picasso at last relented and lapsed into repose. For a few extraordinary minutes, he deliberately gave me the chance to study him without impediment. I noticed how tough and alert he appeared, still taut in a blue-and-white striped jersey. As compact as a wrestler, the deeply tanned figure resembled an athletic 60-year-old rather than a man who would soon be celebrating his 84th birthday.
I marvelled at the youthfulness of his clear, dark eyes, set with startling intensity in features remarkably unencumbered by the folds of slack flesh on so many elderly faces. The eyes were mesmerising, and I tried to give them the necessary forcefulness. After fastening themselves on whatever they wanted to scrutinise, they did not blink until the unwavering gaze moved elsewhere.
He also seemed curiously removed and alone, even though there was plenty of company nearby. His engaging burst of buffoonery could not disguise an underlying gravity of spirit. Content to let his friends do most of the talking, he sat in a very private and absorbed silence, pursuing his own isolated interests undisturbed.
When the American lady told me that the Maestro wanted to see his portrait, I became embarrassed and replied that it wasn't good enough to show him. Picasso insisted, however, and after I passed my sketchbook over, he gave my efforts a generous nod.
Then, to my astonishment, he announced that it was now his turn. I lost no time in giving him my crayon, and his hand applied a few swift, decisive strokes to the paper. In a matter of seconds, with beguiling assurance, he outlined a bearded face below the head which had taken me so many anxious minutes to produce.
He handed the pad back, and there was a drawing blithely at odds with my dogged strivings. Picasso had moved one eye onto my nose, and summarised my smile in a single, irresistibly vivacious line. I looked like a creature who had strayed from one of his more lighthearted mythological compositions. Perhaps he saw me as an intruder from another world, peering in at him with all the gauche curiosity of a young man amazed to find himself face-to-face with an artist he venerated.
I thanked Picasso, and asked him if he would be kind enough to sign the drawing. After consultation, the American explained that the Maestro says you already have his signature. So there were limits to the generosity he was prepared to bestow on me!
All the same, I look back now and wonder at my good fortune. Meeting Picasso and, more important, receiving his attention meant an enormous amount to me.","While journeying through Europe as a youthful scholar, I fortuitously encountered Picasso dining al fresco in Cannes. Emboldened by a companion, I solicited his signature; he graciously complied, embellishing the page with a vibrant linear flourish. Our halting dialogue, mediated by an effusive American interpreter, allowed me to express my voracious admiration for his oeuvre. Heeding my friend's exhortation to capitalize on the opportunity, I returned to delineate his visage. Picasso, with impish glee, enacted a spectrum of expressions, testing my resolve before subsiding into a composed stillness that revealed his remarkably youthful and alert countenance. Upon presenting my rendition, he acknowledged it with a nod and then, with beguiling assurance, executed a rapid caricature of me, whimsically transposing an eye onto my nose. My subsequent entreaty for his autograph on this drawing was met with a refusal, as he deemed his prior signature sufficient. In retrospect, I marvel at the serendipity of engaging with such a revered artist and the indelible impression it imparted."

Barbara Michaels meets the acclaimed crime writer, whose innocent exterior hides a complex and brilliant imagination.

Best-selling crime writer P.D. James - the initials stand for Phyllis Dorothy - exudes an air of quiet authority. It is easy to envisage her, had she not become a creator of detective stories with more twists and turns than a spiral staircase, as a headmistress of a girls' school. But it is soon apparent from what she says that the authoritative mien is, in fact, a cloak for shyness. She reluctantly admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her novels, 'is, I suppose, modelled on myself - or rather, the way I would have turned out if I had been a man'. Dalgliesh prefers to unravel the complexities of crimes solo, as does his creator. 'I need time on my own, particularly when I am writing. I can write more or less anywhere as long as I have total privacy.'
She is too modest to concur with the view that she is Britain's best-known crime writer, even though her books - 12 major detective novels - are read avidly by millions all over the world. She herself is a great fan of the works of close friend Ruth Rendell. 'I particularly enjoy her psychological works, written under the name of Barbara Vine.' Books beside her bed are most likely to be by women writers such as Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner and Penelope Lively, although not to the total exclusion of male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she considers to have been the greatest novelists of their generation.
Success came to P.D. James late in life. Now in her seventies, she was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. Born in Oxford, the eldest of three children, Phyllis grew up mainly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11 years old. 'I met my husband there - he was a student at the university, and I have always loved the place. That is why I chose it as the setting for An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.'
Reluctantly, she reveals that from a promising start, life has been hard, even tragic at times. Her Irish doctor husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from the Second World War, during which he served with the Royal Army Medical
Corps, a very sick man. 'I had to work long hours to support him and our two young daughters, Clare and Jane. The ideas were teeming in my head, but I could do practically nothing about it - I simply hadn't the time. My husband's parents, however, were marvellous, and took my daughters under their wing, giving them a sense of security throughout those difficult years.'
While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she made good use of her enviable organisational skills. At one point, five psychiatric outpatients' clinics came under her jurisdiction. Then followed 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department, doing administration for forensic science research, and then in the Criminal Law section, in the juvenile crime division. It was while working in forensic science that she became 'quite accustomed' to the sight of corpses. But it was not fascination with death itself that inspired her. 'It was, rather, the shape and construction involved in the writing of a crime novel that appealed. I have always enjoyed reading detective stories, and I always knew that I wanted to be a writer.'
'I didn't want to use the traumatic events of my own life in a work of fiction. The writing of a detective story appealed as a wonderful apprenticeship for someone setting out to be a serious novelist, and it was suitably remove from my own experience. As I went on, I became increasingly aware that one could stay within the constraints and indeed within the so-called formula of the classic detective story and still write a good, serious and revealing novel about human beings. Writing detective stories', she says, 'is a way of bringing order out of disorder. The solution of a crime confirms the sanctity of life - even If that life ls unlovable. Nobody really likes violence.'",C1,"P.D. James is a writer. She writes crime books. She is shy but looks strong. Her detective is like her. She likes to work alone. She is famous, but she does not say she is the best. She likes books by her friend Ruth Rendell and other women writers. She also reads books by men. She started writing when she was older. She was 42 when her first book came out. She grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there. Life was hard for her. Her husband was sick after the war. She worked a lot to care for her family. She worked in hospitals and for the government. She saw dead bodies but did not like death. She liked writing crime stories. She says crime stories make things orderly and show that life is important.","P.D. James is a well-known crime writer. She appears confident but is actually shy. Her detective character, Adam Dalgliesh, is based on herself. She prefers to work alone, just like her detective. She is modest about her success, even though millions read her books worldwide. She enjoys books by her friend Ruth Rendell and other authors like Iris Murdoch and Graham Greene. She became successful later in life, publishing her first novel at age 42. She grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband. Her life was difficult because her husband returned from war very ill, and she had to work long hours to support their two daughters. She worked in the National Health Service and the Home Office, where she saw corpses but was not fascinated by death. She was drawn to the structure of crime novels and believes they bring order and affirm the value of life.","P.D. James is a celebrated crime writer whose calm appearance conceals her shy nature. She admits that her detective, Adam Dalgliesh, is modelled on herself, reflecting her preference for working alone. Despite her global fame with twelve major novels, she remains humble and is a fan of authors like Ruth Rendell and Iris Murdoch. Success came to her later in life; she published her first book at 42. Born in Oxford, she grew up in Cambridge, where she met her husband. Her life involved hardships, as her husband returned from World War II severely ill, forcing her to work extensively to support their family. Her careers in the National Health Service and Home Office exposed her to forensic science and corpses, but she was inspired by the craft of crime writing, not death itself. She views detective stories as a way to impose order and highlight the sanctity of life.","P.D. James, the distinguished crime novelist, projects an aura of authority that masks an underlying shyness. She acknowledges that her detective protagonist, Adam Dalgliesh, is a reflection of her own character, embodying her solitary working style. Although her twelve detective novels have garnered international acclaim, she modestly refrains from claiming the title of Britain's foremost crime writer and admires works by contemporaries such as Ruth Rendell. Her literary success was achieved in mid-life, with her debut published at age 42. Growing up in Cambridge after a childhood move, she developed an affinity for the city, which influenced her writing settings. Personal adversities included her husband's post-war illness, necessitating her prolonged employment in administrative roles within the National Health Service and Home Office, where she encountered forensic environments. She was drawn to the structural intricacies of crime fiction, perceiving it as a means to restore order and affirm life's value, rather than from any morbid fascination.","P. D. James

224,"We changed lives for a day!

Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant and entertainment complex.

A. Amanda's story

I'd never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else!
I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first!
By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I'd remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated.
After a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say 'Pardon?', which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day!
I never realised how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shrinking violets, but in fact you definitely need to be quite bubbly, as well having the ability to keep a cool head and deal with what is known in the trade as a 'high-volume experience' - in other words, lots of customers!
I'm really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets chaotically busy. I wasn't too impressed with the pay either. Unfortunately, I must have been a lousy waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me a bean!
I must admit I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing!

B. Cindy's story

I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I'd been warned the girls were cheeky, but in my ignorance I thought I could handle it. Little did I know!
As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house and do the washing.
At 1 pm I picked up Katie, whizzed around the supermarket and then took her home for lunch. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could! I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!
After much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink, for heaven's sake? Of course, I realised it was just a ploy so they could come downstairs and watch television, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating deals with them.
I never realised how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sheer sense of responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.

Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school.

C. Rosemary's story

On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was pure luxury! But I dithered for ages about how to look. I could hardly turn up in overalls and boots, could I?
Looking at a sea of faces -- about 400 pupils -- at assembly, I hoped I melted into the background and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm.
After that it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables in unison! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails.
By lunchtime I was exhausted and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials.
Alter lunch there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practise on me, which really showed up my rusty French.
Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.
The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming, anyway!

D. Hilary's story

I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she manufactures ice-cream, yoghurt and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! At lunchtime it was time to inspect the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe which had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over they could die, so they have to he checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter!
Alter feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year!
I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't answer back! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year.

She participated in classes and staff meetings, feeling drained by the constant activity and the challenge of public speaking. Hilary, a teacher, worked on Rosemary's farm, handling tasks like milking cows and producing dairy products. She missed interaction with people and noted the relentless nature of farm work.

Farming seems romantic but the reality is very different. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.","A quartet of individuals engaged in a day-long life exchange, revealing profound insights into disparate vocations. Amanda, a mother, immersed herself in the frenetic milieu of a high-end London restaurant as a waitress, grappling with the cacophony and dexterity required for service; her initial fumbles and physical exhaustion underscored the role's demands for ebullience and composure amidst high-volume patronage. Cindy, conversely, assumed maternal responsibilities, navigating the caprices of two spirited children and domestic tasks, which, while arduous, afforded her a sense of fulfillment through relentless caregiving. In a parallel swap, Rosemary, a dairy farmer, transitioned to teaching, confronting the pedagogical rigors of classroom management and public oration, which she found mentally draining compared to her agrarian routine. Hilary, an educator, undertook farm labor, from artisanal dairy production to the exigencies of livestock maintenance, discerning the solitude and unyielding schedule that define agricultural existence. These interludes fostered a nuanced appreciation for the complexities inherent in each occupation."
225,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?

We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said.

Publisher A

Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The Book Marketing Council found some years ago that when questioned on why they had bought a particular hook, more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence (advertisements, word of mouth, bookshop display, etc.).
Authors' responses to reviews are slightly different from publishers. Both are devastated by no reviews, but publishers are usually more equable about the had reviews, judging that column inches are what matter and that a combination of denunciation and ecstatic praise can actually create sales as readers decide to judge for themselves.
Publishers probably get the most pleasure from a review which precisely echoes their own response to a book - they are often the first 'reader'.

Publisher B

While publishers and the press fairly obviously have a common interest in the nature of book review pages, one also needs to remember that their requirements substantially differ: a newspaper or magazine needs to provide its readers with appropriately entertaining material; a publishing house wants to see books, preferably its own, reviewed, preferably favourably.
Without any question, book reviewing is 'better' -- more diverse, less elitist -- than 40 years ago, when I began reading review pages. That said, there is still a long-grumbled-about tendency to neglect the book medium read by a majority -- namely paperbacks. The weekly roundups aren't really adequate even if conscientiously done. And even original paperbacks only rarely receive serious coverage.
But publishers shouldn't complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews, which after all are an economical way of getting a book and an author known. There is no question that a lively account of a new book by a trusted name can generate sales even more if there are several of them. Fame is what puts a book into the hands of readers.

Publisher C

Reviews are the oxygen of literary publishing; without them, we would be cut off from an essential life-source. Because the books we publish are generally not by 'brand-name' authors, whose books sell with or without reviews, and because we seldom advertise, we depend on the space given to our books by literary editors.
When the reviews are favourable, of course, they are worth infinitely more than any advertisement. The reader knows that the good review is not influenced by the publisher's marketing budget: it is the voice of reason, and there is no doubt that it helps to sell books. Publishers themselves often claim that they look for size rather than content in reviews.
The actual effect of reviews on sales is the inscrutable heart of the whole business. Good reviews can launch a book and a career and occasionally lift sales into the stratosphere: but never entirely on their own. There has to be some fusion with other elements -- a word-of-mouth network of recommendation, a robust response from the book trade, clever marketing.

Publisher D

The relationship in Britain between publishing and reviewing? I wish I knew! In the United States it's simple: the New York Times can make or break a book with a single review. Here, though, the people in the bookshops often don't appear to take much notice of them.
It sometimes takes 20 years of consistently outstanding reviews for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet some of the most dismally received books, or books not yet reviewed, are the biggest sellers of all. So it's all very unpredictable, though non-action is less so.
Mind you, non-fiction does allow reviewers to indulge themselves by telling us what they know about the subject of the book under review rather than about the book itself.

Publisher E

Of course, all publishers and all writers dream of long, uniformly laudatory reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography. The reviews were everything I could have craved. The book was a flop -- because everyone thought that, by reading the lengthy reviews, they need not buy the book.
Does the name of the reviewer make a difference? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, the public seemed to take note and obey their recommendations. These days, it is as much the choice of an unexpected reviewer, or the sheer power or wit or originality of the review, which urges the prospective buyer into the bookshop.",C1,"Do reviews help sell books? We asked five book publishers. They said: Reviews are very important. Many people buy books because of reviews. Authors and publishers are sad if there are no reviews. Publishers like good and bad reviews because they make people talk about the book. Publishers are happy when a review says the same thing they think about a book. Publishers and newspapers both want reviews, but for different reasons. Newspapers want to entertain readers. Publishers want good reviews for their books. Reviews are better now than 40 years ago. But paperbacks do not get many reviews. Reviews are a cheap way to make books famous. Good reviews from trusted people can sell books. For some publishers, reviews are like air - very important. They need reviews because they do not have famous authors or ads. Good reviews are better than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often want big reviews, not just the words. Good reviews can start a book's success, but other things like people talking are also needed. In the UK, reviews do not always change sales like in the US. Sometimes, books with bad reviews sell a lot. It is hard to know what will happen. For non-fiction, reviewers sometimes talk about the subject, not the book. All publishers want good reviews. But good reviews do not always sell books. One publisher had a book with great reviews, but it did not sell because people read the reviews instead of buying the book. The reviewer's name was important in the past. Now, a surprising reviewer or a clever review can make people buy the book.","Do reviews sell books? We asked five British publishers about how reviews affect book sales. Here are their answers. Publisher A said reviews are key. More people buy books because of reviews than ads or word of mouth. Authors and publishers are upset with no reviews, but publishers accept bad reviews because any attention can help sales. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own thoughts on a book. Publisher B said publishers and newspapers both want reviews, but newspapers aim to entertain, while publishers want positive reviews for their books. Reviews have improved over 40 years, but paperbacks are often ignored. Reviews are a cost-effective way to promote books, and good reviews from trusted sources can increase sales. Publisher C called reviews the oxygen of publishing, essential for books without famous authors or ads. Favorable reviews are more valuable than ads because they are unbiased. Good reviews can boost sales, but they need support from word-of-mouth and marketing. Publisher D noted that in the UK, reviews do not always influence sales as in the US, where the New York Times can make a big difference. Some well-reviewed books take years to sell, while poorly reviewed ones can be bestsellers. Non-fiction reviews sometimes focus on the subject rather than the book. Publisher E said publishers dream of great reviews, but they do not always lead to sales. One biography had excellent reviews but sold poorly because people felt they did not need to buy the book after reading the reviews. In the past, certain reviewers influenced buyers, but now, unexpected reviewers or witty reviews can drive sales.","Do reviews contribute to book sales? We consulted five leading British publishers on the impact of reviews on commercial success. Publisher A emphasized that reviews are crucial; surveys show reviews are the top reason people buy books. Authors and publishers are disheartened by no reviews, but publishers are more tolerant of negative ones, believing that any publicity can generate sales as readers form their own opinions. Publishers derive satisfaction from reviews that reflect their own views. Publisher B highlighted the shared interest between publishers and the press in reviews, though newspapers seek entertaining content while publishers desire favorable coverage. Reviews have become more diverse and less elitist over the past 40 years, but paperbacks are frequently overlooked. Reviews serve as an economical promotion tool, and compelling reviews from respected critics can significantly enhance sales. Publisher C described reviews as essential for literary publishing, particularly for books without established authors or advertising. Positive reviews are more effective than ads due to their perceived objectivity. While good reviews can launch a book and boost careers, they must be combined with word-of-mouth and marketing efforts to achieve high sales. Publisher D pointed out the unpredictability in the UK, where reviews do not consistently affect sales unlike in the US. Some authors gain recognition only after years of positive reviews, while others succeed despite poor reviews. In non-fiction, reviewers often discuss the subject matter rather than the book itself. Publisher E acknowledged that publishers aspire to glowing reviews, but these do not guarantee sales; for instance, a well-reviewed biography failed because readers felt the reviews sufficed. Historically, specific reviewers influenced purchases, but now, the reviewer's identity or the review's quality can motivate buyers.","Do reviews influence book sales? We inquired with five prominent British publishers regarding the effect of reviews on commercial achievement. Publisher A asserted that reviews are fundamental; empirical evidence indicates that reviews are the primary motivator for book purchases, surpassing advertisements and word-of-mouth. While both authors and publishers are dismayed by the absence of reviews, publishers maintain equanimity towards negative critiques, contending that any media exposure can stimulate sales by encouraging readers to evaluate the book independently. Publishers experience gratification when a review aligns precisely with their own assessment. Publisher B noted the symbiotic relationship between publishers and the press, though their objectives diverge: newspapers aim to provide engaging material, whereas publishers seek favorable reviews for their titles. The landscape of book reviewing has evolved over four decades, becoming more varied and less exclusive, yet a persistent bias against paperbacks remains. Reviews constitute a cost-efficient method of promotion, and persuasive accounts from esteemed reviewers can substantially drive sales. Publisher C characterized reviews as indispensable for literary publishing, especially for works by non-brand-name authors who rely on review coverage in lieu of advertising. Favorable reviews possess greater credibility than advertisements, as they are perceived as impartial assessments. Although positive reviews can catalyze a book's success and elevate an author's career, they must synergize with elements like word-of-mouth networks and strategic marketing to achieve remarkable sales. Publisher D reflected on the enigmatic nature of the UK market, where reviews do not exert the decisive influence seen in the US, exemplified by the New York Times. Some authors accumulate readership gradually through consistent critical acclaim, while others achieve commercial triumph despite adverse reviews. In non-fiction, reviewers occasionally prioritize the subject over the book's content. Publisher E observed that while publishers and authors covet uniformly positive reviews, their commercial impact is not assured; a biography with exemplary reviews failed commercially because potential buyers deemed the reviews sufficient. Previously, the reviewer's reputation swayed public opinion, but contemporary buyers are motivated by the reviewer's unexpected choice or the review's intellectual vigor and originality.","DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?

We solicited insights from five eminent British publishers on the ramifications of literary critiques upon commercial prosperity. Publisher A posited that reviews are quintessential; empirical studies, such as those by the Book Marketing Council, reveal that reviews constitute the predominant impetus for acquisitions, eclipsing other influences like advertisements or word-of-mouth. Authors and publishers alike are disconsolate in the face of review omissions, yet publishers exhibit greater equanimity towards negative appraisals, judging that mere column inches can engender sales as readers resolve to adjudicate independently. Publishers derive profound satisfaction from critiques that resonate with their own hermeneutic engagement with the text. Publisher B elucidated the confluence of interests between publishers and the press, albeit with divergent exigencies: periodicals necessitate entertaining content for their readership, while publishing houses ardently desire favorable coverage for their imprints. The milieu of book reviewing has undergone a transformation over four decades, becoming more pluralistic and less parochial, though a perennial grievance persists regarding the neglect of paperbacks, the medium of the majority. Reviews function as an economical conduit for publicity, and incisive analyses from venerated critics can precipitate significant sales escalations. Publisher C metaphorically depicted reviews as the vital oxygen of literary publishing, indispensable for titles sans brand-name auteurs or substantial advertising budgets. Propitious reviews are inestimably more efficacious than advertisements, owing to their perceived objectivity and intellectual integrity. While laudatory reviews can inaugurate a book's ascent and occasionally propel sales to stratospheric heights, such outcomes are contingent upon a confluence with ancillary factors—a robust word-of-mouth ecosystem, resolute trade responses, and astute marketing stratagems. Publisher D contemplated the inscrutable dynamics of the British publishing-reviewing nexus, contrasting it with the US, where a solitary New York Times review can be determinative. Some authors accrue readership through decades of sustained critical plaudits, whilst others achieve commercial preeminence despite tepid or absent reviews. In non-fiction, reviewers often indulge in expatiating upon the subject matter rather than critiquing the tome itself. Publisher E ruminated that whilst publishers and authors fantasize about uniformly encomiastic reviews, their commercial efficacy is not guaranteed; a biography replete with adulatory critiques foundered commercially, as potential purchasers surmised that perusing the extensive reviews obviated the need for acquisition. Historically, the reviewer's cachet significantly influenced public propensity, but contemporaneously, it is the reviewer's unexpected selection or the critique's sheer puissance, wit, and originality that impel prospective buyers to procure the volume."
226,"Chewing gum culture

It's fashionable, classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today's gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners which help to hold the flavour and improve the texture.
This was not always the case, though. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree, a shrub found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Grecian women, especially, favoured mastic gum to clean their teeth and sweeten their breath.
American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees when the bark was cut. Lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States in the early 1800s making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree of the Central American rainforest.
Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew, and soon a whole industry was born based on this product.
Yet repeated attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed. As the chewing gum market has grown, synthetic alternatives have had to be developed.
Today the few remaining chicle gatherers, chicleros, eke out a meagre and dangerous living, trekking for miles to tap scattered sapodilla in near-100% humidity. Conditions are appalling: highly poisonous snakes lurk ready to pounce and insects abound.
Most alarming is the unpleasant little chicle fly that likes to lodge its eggs in the tappers ears and nose.
Braving these hazards, barefooted and with only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero will shin a mature tree in minutes to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow down to a bag below.
Each chiclero must carry the liquid on his back to a forest camp, where it is boiled until sticky and made into bricks. Life at the camp is no picnic either, with a monotonous and often deficient maize-based diet washed down by a local alcohol distilled from sugar cane.
Yet, punishing though this working environment is, the remaining chicleros fear for their livelihood.
Not so long ago, the United States alone imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America. Last year just 200 tonnes were tapped in the whole of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.
Meanwhile, the world's gum producers are finding ingenious ways of marketing their products. In addition to all the claims made for gum - it helps you relax, peps you up and eases tension (soldiers during both world wars were regularly supplied with gum) - gums greatest claim is that it reduces tooth decay.
Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes this. Our saliva, which neutralises the acid and supplies minerals such as calcium, phosphate and fluoride, is the body's natural defence. Gum manufacturers say 20 minutes of chewing can increase your salivary flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavours. Glycerine and other vegetable oil products are now used to blend the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial - but some flavours still need natural assistance.
In addition, one hundred and thirty-seven square kilometres of America is devoted entirely to producing the mint that is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world.",C1,"Chewing gum is popular. People in America chew 12 million pieces every day. It has very few calories. It is made from man-made things and tree parts. Long ago, Greeks chewed gum from a tree to clean teeth. American colonists learned from Native Americans and chewed tree gum. This was the first gum sold in the U.S. Modern gum started with chicle from a tree in Central America. This gum was better. But growing this tree is hard, so people use man-made gum now. Chicle gatherers have a hard job. They walk far in wet forests with snakes and insects. A small fly can lay eggs in their ears or nose. They climb trees to get the sap and carry it to camp. Life at camp is tough with simple food and drink. Fewer people gather chicle now because companies use man-made gum to save money. Gum companies say chewing gum helps you relax and stops tooth decay. Chewing makes more spit, which protects teeth. New gums have different feels and tastes. Some tastes are natural, like mint from big farms in America.","Chewing gum is fashionable and popular for everyone. Americans chew 12 million sticks each day.

They climb trees with ropes and axes to collect sap, carry it to camp, and boil it into bricks. Camp life is hard with boring food and local alcohol. Chicleros worry about their jobs because chicle use has dropped; for example, the U.S. now imports much less chicle. Gum companies use synthetics to cut costs. They market gum as helping relaxation, reducing tension, and preventing tooth decay by increasing saliva flow.

The remaining chicleros, who gather chicle, face arduous and perilous conditions, trekking through near-100% humidity forests inhabited by highly poisonous snakes and abundant insects, including the troublesome chicle fly that oviposits in their ears and noses.

Camp life is equally challenging, characterized by a monotonous, maize-based diet and local sugarcane alcohol.

227,"An awfully big adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it, and lived to tell the tale.

There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialise in them -- courageous explorers with sunburnt, leathery skin and eyes narrowed by straining to see into far horizons on their journeys into the unknown. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across one of the last unexplored places on earth, the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He recalled the dangers and exhilaration of that amazing trek, in the calm atmosphere of his family home.
The team he led was composed of four Britons (one of them the party's medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese (all experts on the area), 30 camels and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before, but were long-distance lorry drivers: a misunderstanding that could have cost everyone their lives and certainly jeopardised the expedition's success. This mixed bunch set out to cross 1,200 kilometres of the world's least hospitable desert and Charles Blackmore has written a mesmerising account of their journey. 
At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He launched the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. 'I had always assumed I'd spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered promotion but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a tremendous gamble. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn't come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the event, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.'
Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word 'kind'. The team suffered unspeakable hardships: dysentery; extremes of temperature; severe thirst and dehydration; the loss of part of their precious water supply. 'But', Blackmore explains, 'when we were at the limits of our own endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's legendary sandstorms. And we never hit the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally immobilised us. That's not to say that we weren't fighting against hurdles the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily laden camels, which often rolled over onto us.
'What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no contingency plan. Neither our budget no time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills we were completely on our own.
'I knew I had the mental stamina for the trip but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one -- we sat at the edge of the desert and it was such an inferno that you couldn't breathe. I thought, ""We've got to do it now!"" At that moment I was a very scared man.'
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? 'When you've walked for 1,000 kilometres you're not going to duck out. You've endured so much; you've got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and sinewy despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.'
Midway through the book, Blackmore went on to describe lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How conscious was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? 'Inside me there's someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievements, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've dine. Yet in terms of a lifetime's achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share -- against that yardstick, the desert does not measure up, does not compare.'
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? 'I yearn for the challenge -- for the open spaces -- the resolve of it all. We were buoyed up by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.'",C1,"A very big adventure. The Taklamakan Desert is in China. It is a big, dangerous place. Charles Blackmore went across it. He lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures now. Charles led a group across the desert. The group had people from Britain, America, and China. They had camels. The camel helpers were not experts. They were truck drivers. This was a problem. They walked 1,200 km. It took 59 days. They had many problems: sickness, very hot and cold, no water. But they found water when they needed it. No big sandstorms came. Charles was scared but kept going. He wanted to survive. He felt proud after. He likes challenges more than normal life.","A very big adventure. The Taklamakan Desert in China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and survived. There are few big adventures and heroes today. Charles led an expedition across this desert. Its name means 'once entered, you never come out.' The team had British, American, and Chinese people, plus camels and handlers. The handlers were not camel experts; they were lorry drivers, which was risky. They crossed 1,200 km in 59 days. Charles did this for fun and to find himself. They faced hardships like dysentery, extreme temperatures, and thirst. They found water just in time and had no bad sandstorms. Charles was scared but determined. He felt strong and proud after. Now, he misses the challenge and finds normal life boring.","An extremely big adventure. The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored and most dangerous places on Earth. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to share his story. In the past, stories featured heroic explorers, but today they are rare. Charles led an expedition across this desert, known as the Desert of Death. The team included Britons, an American photographer, Chinese experts, camels, and handlers. Unfortunately, the handlers were long-distance lorry drivers with no camel experience, which endangered the expedition. They journeyed 1,200 km across the inhospitable desert in 59 days. Charles undertook this adventure after leaving the Army to discover himself. The team endured severe hardships, including dysentery, temperature extremes, and dehydration, but they found water when needed and avoided sandstorms. Charles was initially fearful but driven by survival. He emerged physically strong and proud of the achievement, though he values his family more. Now, he longs for challenges and finds modern life too uniform.","An awfully big adventure. The Taklamakan Desert in western China stands as one of the final unexplored and perilous regions on the planet. Charles Blackmore successfully traversed it and recounted his experience. Contemporary narratives seldom feature such intrepid explorers, whom Charles embodies. He spearheaded an expedition across this desert, ominously termed the Desert of Death. The team comprised four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese specialists, thirty camels, and six handlers. Ironically, the handlers were long-distance lorry drivers lacking camel expertise, a misstep that nearly jeopardised the venture. They covered 1,200 kilometres of the world's most inhospitable desert in 59 days. Charles, transitioning from a 14-year Army career, embarked on this quest for self-discovery. The group confronted dire adversities: dysentery, extreme temperatures, and critical water shortages, yet they serendipitously found water and evaded legendary sandstorms. Despite initial trepidation, Charles's mental fortitude propelled him; he emerged sinewy and resolute, esteeming the expedition as a pinnacle personal feat, though family happiness surpasses it. Presently, he yearns for purposeful challenges, disdaining modern life's conformity.","An awfully big adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it, and lived to tell the tale.

There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to specialise in them -- courageous explorers with sunburnt, leathery skin and eyes narrowed by straining to see into far horizons on their journeys into the unknown. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across one of the last unexplored places on earth, the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means 'once entered you never come out', but local people call it the Desert of Death. He recalled the dangers and exhilaration of that amazing trek, in the calm atmosphere of his family home.
The team he led was composed of four Britons (one of them the party's medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese (all experts on the area), 30 camels and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before, but were long-distance lorry drivers: a misunderstanding that could have cost everyone their lives and certainly jeopardised the expedition's success.

The Taklamakan Desert in western China epitomises one of the ultimate uncharted and hazardous locales on Earth, which Charles Blackmore conquered, subsequently narrating his odyssey. In an era bereft of the archetypal heroes once prevalent in children's lore—courageous explorers with weathered visages and far-seeing eyes—Charles's real-life exploit stands as a rare testament to such daring. He masterminded an expedition across this formidable desert, whose appellation translates to 'once entered, you never emerge,' colloquially dubbed the Desert of Death. The assemblage he led included four Britons (one serving as medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese area experts, thirty camels, and six camel handlers, who, in a perilous misunderstanding, were long-distance lorry drivers devoid of camel-handling proficiency, imperilling the entire endeavour. This eclectic cohort undertook a 1,200-kilometre traverse of the planet's most inhospitable desert, and Charles has rendered a mesmerising chronicle of their 59-day journey. At the time, on the cusp of departing the Army after fourteen contented years, he initiated the expedition for amusement, to fill a void, and to ascertain his identity beyond military confines—a tremendous gamble that deeply concerned his wife, Tina, given the route's unprecedented nature. Enduring unspeakable hardships—dysentery, temperature extremities, severe dehydration, and the loss of part of their water supply—the team persevered, fortuitously locating water at critical junctures, evading the desert's fabled sandstorms and immobilising cold. Charles, grappling with fear yet buoyed by an imperative to survive in the absence of contingency plans or aerial oversight, found his mental stamina tested but ultimately triumphed, emerging physically honed and sinewy. Reflecting on the ordeal, he regards it as a paramount personal achievement, though it pales beside the yardstick of familial bliss. Presently, he yearns for the resoluteness and expansive challenges, finding modern life's uniformity disquieting."

Many different kinds of transport are used. Often on the same trip. We travel by chartered coach or local bus, by train, expedition vehicle, minibus, boat, canoe, raft, camel, light plane etc. And often on foot. Each trip takes on the character of the local terrain.

Who Travels with Explore?

Interesting people with the resilience to tackle new situations and get the most out of an original adventure. Mainly from the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the States. All our trips are designed to be within the capabilities of almost anyone who enjoys good health, is reasonably fit, and above all adaptable. The majority are aged between 25 and 55. About half are couples. The rest are enterprising individuals travelling alone.

Activities and Interests

It's not easy to describe Explore Worldwide. Each trip is completely unique. So we have divided our worldwide adventures into 8 different categories, describing some of the main activities and interests. Each category represents a special highlight that is an integral part of a particular tour, and of course trips have several different highlights. However, please bear in mind that many other factors contribute to the success of all our trips as a whole. Unique places, unusual encounters, strange customs, unpredictable events, personal involvement - all play their part in the full enjoyment of your holiday.

Cultural/Adventure

Almost all the trips in our brochure have a strong cultural feeling. But a certain number of tours have this as their primary emphasis, focusing closely on local cultures, ethnic peoples and classic sites. For example, anyone looking for destinations of outstanding cultural and historical interest should consider our trips in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala and Belize - to mention a few of the places featured in our programme! Short day walks of 2-4 hours to visit unusual or off-the-tourist-track sites are often an integral part of our trips.

Wildlife and Natural History

Our wildlife safaris visit many of the world's greatest game parks and offer a thrilling encounter with animals in their natural state. Choose from dozens of remarkable destinations. In Africa, for example, you often have the freedom to step outside your safari vehicle and tackle the wild terrain for yourself. You could track the rare silver-back mountain gorilla in Zaire, go bush walking with tribal guides in Uganda, climb Mount Kenya, ride a canoe on the Zambezi River or a traditional mokoro in the Okavango Delta. Most African safaris camp, and full camping equipment is provided. A few offer hotel and lodge accommodation throughout. Elsewhere, in Asia and South America, on trips which include game viewing - say, our tiger safari in India - we usually stay in hotels, resthouses and jungle lodges. In Darwin's famous Galapagos Islands we live aboard a small motor yacht.

Ethnic Encounters

A special highlight of an Explore Worldwide adventure is the opportunity it offers to meet ethnic or tribal peoples. These could be the 'Blue Men' or Tuareg of the Central Sahara, the Maya of Mexico, or the colourful Huli of Papua New Guinea. Some, like the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, are nomadic wanderers. Others, like the pygmies of the Ituri Forest, are hunter-gatherers; or dry rice farmers like the friendly hilltribe peoples of Northern Thailand. Many are often part of an 'Old World' culture. Their societies are often under serious threat from unscrupulous exploiters. We travel in small groups only. Our aim is to help spread tolerance and understanding between different races and peoples, with the minimum of culture and environmental disturbance.

Easy/Moderate Hiking

Many trips include a few days' easy walking through open countryside, based on rented or hotel accommodation; also village-to-village hiking which involves some trail walking with the prospect of overnighting along the way in private houses or basic village huts. You'll find such trips in Spain's Sierra Nevada, in Provence, Tuscany, Crete, Corsica, Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, Venezuela, and many other Explore Worldwide destinations. On long distance walks involving more than one day, all your main luggage is transported by a separate vehicle, or carried by porters or pack animals. You simply bring a daypack for your personal gear.

Major Treks

A limited number of major treks are offered for strong mountain walkers. These sometimes involve walking at elevations over 10,000 feet, with substantial altitude gains and losses during a single day. We may lodge with the local people or rough-camp in the world's great mountain ranges like the Atlas, Kackar, Himalayas and Andes. Or we use a mixture of well-appointed camp-sites and alpine chalets in more sophisticated mountain areas such as the Alps. Such trips usually involve support vehicles, porterage or pack animals. We rarely backpack or carry heavy gear.

Wilderness Experience

Discovering one of the world's remote wilderness areas is a thrilling and memorable experience - perhaps the ultimate travel adventure. Such places have a strong fascination for the intrepid traveller, holding out the prospect of exotic new horizons. We explore the haunting beauty of the Amazon Rainforest and experience the powerful mystique of the Sahara, Great Thor, Namib and Gobi Deserts. They offer a chance to participate in an adventure few people could ever dream of.

Sailtreks/Seatreks

These are among the most original and relaxing holidays in our brochure. We charter local boats and journey by traditional felucca sailboat through Upper Egypt; we utilise gulets (wooden motor yachts) in Turkey and island-to-island ferries in countries like Greece and Thailand. Our 2-masted schooner explores the islands of the Indonesian Archipelago, while a small motor yacht is chartered to cruise among the unique wildlife habitats of the Galapagos.

Raft and River Journeys

River journeys can last from a few hours to several days, and range from 2-person inflatables which participants paddle themselves (on the Dordogne River, for example) to all the fun, thrills and excitement of whitewater railing navigated by skilled oarsmen (such as on Peru's beautiful Urubamba River or the wild Trisuli River in Nepal). No previous experience is necessary and the appropriate safety skills are quickly learned. Our river trips in India, Africa and the Amazon offer us a unique insight into the fertile margins and exotic jungles.",C1,"Explore Worldwide is a travel company.

Cultural and adventure sojourns evince a pronounced ethnographic tenor, with select tours prioritizing this dimension through intensive engagement with autochthonous cultures, ethnic collectives, and seminal historical sites, as exemplified by destinations such as Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Belize, often incorporating diurnal perambulations of two to four hours to arcane or non-touristic venues. Wildlife and natural history safaris perambulate the planet's preeminent game reserves, proffering visceral interactions with fauna in their native habitats; in Africa, for instance, one might alight from vehicles to traverse untamed landscapes, pursue the rare silver-back mountain gorilla in Zaire, undertake bush walking with tribal guides in Uganda, ascend Mount Kenya, or navigate waterways in canoes or mokoros, with accommodations ranging from full camping to hotels. Ethnic encounters constitute a distinctive highlight, facilitating rapprochement with groups such as the Tuareg of the Central Sahara, the Maya of Mexico, or the Huli of Papua New Guinea—societies often imperiled by exploitation—with travel conducted in small groups to promulgate tolerance and minimize cultural and ecological perturbation. Easy and moderate hiking entails trajection through bucolic settings in locales like Spain's Sierra Nevada, Provence, or Thailand, utilizing rented or hotel accommodations, or village-to-village itineraries with overnight stays in rudimentary huts, and logistical support for luggage. Major treks, reserved for stalwart mountaineers, may involve ascents exceeding ten thousand feet in ranges such as the Atlas, Kackar, Himalayas, and Andes, employing rough camping or local lodging, supplemented by support vehicles or porterage. Wilderness experiences proffer exhilarating forays into remote domains like the Amazon Rainforest or the Sahara, Gobi, and other deserts, appealing to the audacious traveler with the allure of exotic horizons. Sailtreks and seatreks epitomize originality and tranquility, employing indigenous craft such as feluccas in Upper Egypt, gulets in Turkey, or schooners in Indonesia for archipelagic exploration. River journeys encompass durations from hours to days, varying from participant-paddled inflatables on rivers like the Dordogne to expert-navigated whitewater rafting on the Urubamba or Trisuli, necessitating no prior expertise and swiftly imparting requisite safety competencies, while affording unique perspectives on riparian ecosystems and jungles."
230,"Is your office working ok?

Fresh air and the right chairs are the key to a happy, healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We went to four contrasting offices, to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist, who studies people's working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. Here are their verdicts.

Office A. Advertising Agency

Building Health Consultant: This office is about as simple as it could possibly be; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows opening straight onto the street. It is difficult to see why this space works but the occupants who are part of a small, dynamic team, appear to have few complaints. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators -- pretty much, perhaps, as they do in their own homes. This may be the key: a team of seven people have crated a happy, homely working environment and do not have to put up with any externally imposed bureaucracy.
Ergonomist: The furniture here has evolved; no two pieces match. Much of it actually creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable and many are broken. Although in that way this environment is poor, the personnel have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, out meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom and muscular problems.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are delighted with the variety of work and the versatility of the office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to be able to be on your own and focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, simultaneously conveying images of efficiency and creativity.

Office B. News Service

Building Health Consultant: While the office may not be very exciting, it appears comfortable and is not disliked by the staff. The air quality and general maintenance standards appear to be good. This is helped by a No Smoking policy.
Ergonomist: I was not surprised to learn that the company had already employed the services of an ergonomist. Chairs are excellent, lighting and computer equipment are good. Space provision is good, although the layout could be improved. But the environments is impersonal and unstimulating, with grey, bare walls.
Occupational Psychologist: Walls are bare apart from year planners and a poster describing maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years and relationships are satisfactory. The office could be improved if the desks were positioned to make the sharing of information easier. Proof of success or information on forthcoming projects could be displayed on the walls.

Office C. Bank

Building Health Consultant: An office that produces mixed reactions from those working in it. The feeling inside is akin to being in a glass case, viewed by, and viewing, countless similar exhibits. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a relatively small space, the air did not appear to be stale. Even standing only 1.5 metres away from a smoker, it was not possible to smell his cigarette. 
Ergonomist: The office area is, sadly, very standard and totally uninspiring. The desks are adequate, but only just. Not all the chairs being used for computer operation conform to requirements but this is user choice. Computer screens are often on small desk units with lowered keyboard shelves; this is no longer considered appropriate for modern equipment.
Occupational Psychologist: Staff are mutually supportive and well served by technology. Numerous communications awards are on display. The wood coloured panelling and brown carpet give a slightly sombre effect. The office is a buzz of activity.

Office D. Newspaper

Building Health Consultant: It is difficult to say anything good about this building. The air-conditioning control is very crude, resulting in large variations in temperature. The space is cluttered and most people have inadequate desk space. The office is very dusty -- there are plenty of places for dust to lodge. The shed-type roof also collects dust, which, if disturbed, showers those sitting below.
Ergonomist: The furniture would be more at home in a carpentry workshop than in a high-tech industry. Most of the chairs are of little value to keyboard users, particularly those who are shorter than about 1.75 m. Many chairs are old, lack suitable adjustment and have armrests that prevent the user from getting sufficiently close to the desk.
Occupational Psychologist: Old brown chairs, soiled carpets, dust and dirt everywhere. A lot of scope for improvement -- the place needs a good tidy-up, individual success could be more recognised, air conditioning needs to be improved immediately -- there are so many smokers. Few conversations were going on when we visited; everybody seemed stressed and driven by deadlines. The company needs to adopt a policy of team-working.",C1,Is your office good?

Fresh air and ergonomically sound chairs are posited as pivotal to a contented and salubrious workforce, according to a recent survey. We conducted an assessment of four disparate offices with an expert panel comprising a building health consultant, an ergonomist specialising in occupational conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Office A: An advertising agency. The edifice is remarkably rudimentary, eschewing central heating and mechanical ventilation, with windows affording direct street access. Despite this, the occupants—a compact, dynamic cohort—exhibit minimal grievances, adapting to seasonal vicissitudes through manual adjustments akin to domestic practices, thereby cultivating a congenial, bureaucracy-free milieu. The ergonomist noted that the heterogeneous furniture engenders suboptimal postures, yet the diversified work regimen—encompassing clerical duties, client engagements, and presentations—attenuates fatigue and musculoskeletal issues. The occupational psychologist highlighted staff satisfaction with the office's versatility and scale, which balances collegial awareness with solitary focus, exuding an aura of efficiency and creativity. Office B: A news service. The building health consultant observed a comfortable, albeit unremarkable, environment with commendable air quality and upkeep, bolstered by a stringent no-smoking policy. The ergonomist affirmed prior ergonomic interventions, resulting in superior chairs and equipment, though the spatial configuration is imperfect and the ambience impersonal due to austere, unadorned walls. The occupational psychologist noted enduring staff tenure and adequate interpersonal dynamics, suggesting enhancements through reoriented desks for improved information dissemination and wall displays of achievements. Office C: A bank. The building health consultant reported ambivalent staff perceptions, with the interior evoking a vitreous enclosure permitting mutual observation. Air quality remained untainted despite proximate smokers, a testament to effective ventilation. The ergonomist decried the prosaic and uninspiring furnishings, with desks barely adequate and some chairs non-compliant, coupled with antiquated workstation designs. Conversely, the occupational psychologist praised the synergistic staff relations and technological support, with a vibrant atmosphere underscored by communications accolades, albeit tempered by sombre decor. Office D: A newspaper. The building health consultant condemned the structure for its primitive air-conditioning, inducing thermal volatility, pervasive clutter, insufficient desk allocations, and accumulations of dust exacerbated by a shed-style roof. The ergonomist criticised the anachronistic furniture, ill-suited for ergonomic needs, particularly for individuals under 1.75 metres, due to inadequate adjustability and obstructive armrests. The occupational psychologist depicted a dishevelled environment with soiled carpets and detritus, noting staff stress and deadline-driven comportment, with scant dialogue, advocating for immediate refurbishment, enhanced individual recognition, and the adoption of collaborative team-working strategies."
231,"Plugging in the home

Georgina McGuiness had taken a long career break from journalism and she felt out of touch with the changes brought about by technology. She recounts here how she was able to transform the family home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last I turned 37 and realised that time was running out if I wanted to resurrect a career in journalism - which I believed had been washed down the plug-hole ... the technological plug-hole.
A quick glance at my curriculum vitae showed that I was shamefully stuck in the 1980s, when a piece of carbon wedged in between several sheets of paper in a typewriter was the state of the art. It seemed that only a madman would let me loose on a computer in his newsroom. And why did most of the jobs advertised ask for experience in desktop publishing - which I didn't have?
I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar in nuclear physics than attempting to lay out a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even pocket calculators were a mystery to me and I still don't know how to use the timer on the video.
Clearly, there was a gaping hole in what was left of my career and I had to act quickly. Leaving home before the children did would be fraught with obstacles, or so I thought until I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a success story you read or hear about that only ever happens to other people, my family and I won a computer package.
Supplied with a laptop computer to free my husband from his desk, and a personal computer for us all, we dived in at the deep end into a strange new world and terms such as cyberspace, Internet and surfing became commonplace in our vocabulary. We took to chatting like old pals via the Internet to strangers around the world. The children forsook the television and I set up a mini-office in a corner of the kitchen with a telephone-answering facility, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem linking me into the information superhighway.
I had everything I would need for working from home - and I could still manage to take the children to school. They were confident with computers from the start, already well versed in them from school. I was much more hesitant, convinced that all my work would disappear without trace if I pressed the wrong button. I could not have been more wrong.
Though far from being adroit, I did manage to learn the basic skills I needed - il was all so logical, easy and idiot-proof. And, like everything that you persevere with, you learn a little more each day.
I recently began freelancing for a magazine, contributing about two articles a month, and I have become smug in the knowledge that I have the best of two worlds.
So how has the computer helped me? Since my schooldays I have always worked at a desk that can only be described as a chaotic mess. 
Consequently, I was always losing scraps of paper containing vital bits of information. The computer has transformed me into an organised worker, particularly when it comes to office administration.
Spreadsheets help keep a record of income and expenses, and pre-formatted invoices and letterheads have saved me a lol of time and effort. For a journalist, getting on-line with the Internet means I can research stories, ask for further information on the bulletin board in the journalism or publishing forums and even discuss the pros and cons of working from home with people from all over the world.
If all this sounds too good to be true, there is a dark side to computing from home. You can be in isolation from physical human contact. There are the distractions of putting urgent jobs about the house first, and when the children are home there are power struggles in our house over whose turn it is to use the computer.
However, there is a growing band of people who have recently bought multi-media PCs, not just for the educational, leisure and entertainment facilities. In my street alone there appears to be a new type of technical cottage industry evolving from the sheer convenience of not having to join the commuter struggle into the city each day. So what characterises home workers as we move into the next century?

232,"Solar Survivor

Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home.

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain's least-known ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of 'green' men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second, appropriately enough, is Britain's greenest dwelling, the 'autonomous house', designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, together with that of their three teenage children and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. You could easily miss the traditional-looking house, roofed with clay pantiles, on a verdant corner plot 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to echo the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and won approval from the planners even though it is in a conservation area.
Ring the solar-powered doorbell and there is total silence. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off (at Robert's insistence), there is a monastic stillness. It is a sunny summer's day, the windows are closed and the conservatory is doing its normal job of warming the air before it ventilates the house. Vale apologises and moves through the house, opening ingenious ventilation shafts and windows. You need to create draughts because draught-proofing is everywhere: even Edison and Faraday have their own air-locked miniature door. 
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They began by designing a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. Then they got carried away and decided to do without mains water as well. They designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water, which they pass through two filters before use. Water from washing runs into the garden (the Vales don't have a dishwasher because they believe it is morally unacceptable to use strong detergents). Most details have a similar statement in mind. 
'We wanted people to see that it was possible to design a house which would be far less detrimental to the environment, without having to live in the dark,' says Robert. 'It would not be medieval.' The house's only medieval aspect is aesthetic: the hall, which includes the hearth and the staircase, rises the full height of the building.
The Vales pay no water bills. And last winter the house used only nine units of electricity a day costing about 70p -- which is roughly what other four bedroomed houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less, when PS20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and generating equipment arrive and are erected in the garden. The house will draw electricity from the mains supply for cooking and running the appliances, but will generate a surplus of electricity. There will even be enough, one day, to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales claim not to use except in the very coldest winter.
So is it warm in winter? One night in February when I happened to call on him, Robert was sitting reading. It was too warm to light the fire, he said. The room temperature on the first floor was 18C, less than the generally expected temperature of living areas, but entirely comfortable, he claimed, because there are no draughts, no radiant heat loss, since everything you touch is at the same temperature. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady in the early years of the twentieth century was entirely comfortable at 12.5C, he says, because of the insulation provided by her clothing. Those people who live in pre-1900 housing, he suggests, should simply go back to living as people did then. Somehow, it is difficult to think of this idea catching on. 
The house's secret is that it is low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen.

Their design prioritizes zero carbon dioxide emissions and independence from mains water, incorporating composting toilets, subterranean rainwater storage, and copper gutters with dual filtration for potable water. They eschew dishwashers on ethical grounds against harsh detergents. Robert articulates their aim to demonstrate that eco-conscious housing need not sacrifice comfort or modernity. The household incurs no water expenses and consumes minimal electricity, with impending solar installations poised to generate an energy surplus. A modest wood-burning stove is infrequently utilized, as the dwelling retains heat efficiently in winter, leveraging factors like radiant heat balance for perceived comfort. Constructed affordably using conventional materials, this low-tech approach encounters opposition from the commercial building sector.","Solar Survivor

Charles Clover ventures inside Britain's most environmentally-friendly home.

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain's least-known ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of 'green' men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second, appropriately enough, is Britain's greenest dwelling, the 'autonomous house', designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, together with that of their three teenage children and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. You could easily miss the traditional-looking house, roofed with clay pantiles, on a verdant corner plot 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to echo the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and won approval from the planners even though it is in a conservation area.
Ring the solar-powered doorbell and there is total silence. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off (at Robert's insistence), there is a monastic stillness. It is a sunny summer's day, the windows are closed and the conservatory is doing its normal job of warming the air before it ventilates the house. Vale apologises and moves through the house, opening ingenious ventilation shafts and windows. You need to create draughts because draught-proofing is everywhere: even Edison and Faraday have their own air-locked miniature door. 
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They began by designing a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. Then they got carried away and decided to do without mains water as well. They designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water, which they pass through two filters before use. Water from washing runs into the garden (the Vales don't have a dishwasher because they believe it is morally unacceptable to use strong detergents). Most details have a similar statement in mind. 
'We wanted people to see that it was possible to design a house which would be far less detrimental to the environment, without having to live in the dark,' says Robert. 'It would not be medieval.' The house's only medieval aspect is aesthetic: the hall, which includes the hearth and the staircase, rises the full height of the building.
The Vales pay no water bills. And last winter the house used only nine units of electricity a day costing about 70p -- which is roughly what other four bedroomed houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less, when PS20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and generating equipment arrive and are erected in the garden. The house will draw electricity from the mains supply for cooking and running the appliances, but will generate a surplus of electricity. There will even be enough, one day, to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales claim not to use except in the very coldest winter.
So is it warm in winter? One night in February when I happened to call on him, Robert was sitting reading. It was too warm to light the fire, he said. The room temperature on the first floor was 18C, less than the generally expected temperature of living areas, but entirely comfortable, he claimed, because there are no draughts, no radiant heat loss, since everything you touch is at the same temperature. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady in the early years of the twentieth century was entirely comfortable at 12.5C, he says, because of the insulation provided by her clothing. Those people who live in pre-1900 housing, he suggests, should simply go back to living as people did then. Somehow, it is difficult to think of this idea catching on. 
The house's secret is that it is low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build -- it cost the same price per square metre as low-cost housing for rent. Not surprisingly, the commercial building companies are determinedly resisting this idea.","Charles Clover embarks on an exploration of Britain's most ecologically advanced domicile, situated in Southwell, Nottinghamshire—a locale distinguished not only by the obscure antiquity of Southwell Minster cathedral, celebrated for its pagan 'green men' carvings, but also by the pioneering 'autonomous house' engineered by Robert and Brenda Vale. This residence epitomizes environmental sustainability: the Vales employ rainwater for all hydric needs, transmute sewage into horticultural compost, and utilize waste thermal energy from electrical apparatus combined with the metabolic heat of their three teenage offspring and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The edifice, roofed with clay pantiles and designed to echo the burnt-orange brickwork of nineteenth-century local architecture, seamlessly integrates into the conservation area despite its innovative nature. Upon activation of the solar-powered doorbell, one encounters an almost monastic stillness within, attributable to super-insulation and krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which necessitate the manual operation of ventilation shafts to counteract the pervasive draft-proofing, including specialized air-locked portals for the feline inhabitants. As academics in architecture at Nottingham University, the Vales have long espoused environmentalism, authoring 'The Autonomous House' in the 1970s. Their design eschews carbon dioxide emissions and mains water dependency, featuring composting earth closets, subterranean rainwater cisterns, and copper gutters with dual filtration for potability, while forgoing dishwashers due to moral objections to potent detergents. Robert Vale contends that the abode demonstrates the feasibility of minimizing environmental detriment without regressing to medieval conditions, with the sole archaic element being the aesthetic full-height hall. Financially, the household incurs no water charges and consumes a mere nine units of electricity daily, with prospective solar installations anticipated to yield an energy surplus sufficient for electric vehicle charging. The minimal heating—a wood-burning stove rarely engaged—suffices due to the absence of drafts and radiant heat loss, maintaining comfort at lower ambient temperatures, a concept Robert illustrates with historical analogies. The residence's efficacy stems from its low-tech, fault-tolerant construction using readily available materials, rendering it cost-equivalent to social housing, yet it faces staunch resistance from commercial building enterprises."

What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires, an agent of change, a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better, as the early theorists believed. It's not simply about intelligence, either. Pat Dixon, author of the book Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace, says that leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as enhuastic and interested as you are'.
Enthusiasm is a key element and, to convey it and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak out articulately and with conviction. 'It's having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think"", maintains Dixon.

B.
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says, 'Most people have a far greater potential for leadership than they realise. The process of becoming a leader is recognising those latent talents, developing them and using them.'
In one sense, we are all born leaders - we just need the right circumstances in which to flourish. While it's quite easy to recognise leadership in the grand sense -- be it in the form of figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Ghandi or even Richard Branson - it may be more difficult to relate it to our own workplace. And yet this quality is now regarded as the cornerstone of effective management.
 

C.
Consider the best and worst boss you've ever had. They may have been equally good at setting objectives, meeting deadlines and budgets. But what about how they achieved them? The best leader will have motivated you and may have given you support. The worst leader would have made you feel like a small cog in the corporate machinery and kept information from you, and then when things went wrong would have reacted as if it were your fault. The first led (very well); the second simply managed (very badly).

D.
Leaders and managers can be seen as different animals. Managers tend to enjoy working according to set boundaries. Leaders create their own horizons. 'A good manager can keep even an inefficient company running relatively smoothly,' writes Micheal Shea, the author of Leadership Rules. 'But a good leader can transform a demoralised organisation - whether it's a company, a football team or a nation.' 

E.
Whether you're the boss or a middle manager, you can benefit from improving your leadership skills. There are definite lessons to be learnt: 
* Leadership is something we do best when we choose to do it. So find out where your passions and convictions lie. Next time you feel inspired to lead, harness the energy it gives you and act on it.
* Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a powerful part of you. Recognise it.
* Collaboration can be fine, but there will be times when firm leadership is required. Experiment with your style. If you are a natural transactor, try being the negotiator. If you always ask for the views of others, try taking the lead. Watch how the outcome is changed by this change in you.
* You have to set goals, then beat them. Look at the demands of your job and define those where being a leader will greatly enhance your effectiveness and career prospects.

F. 
* Leadership does not simply happen. It can only develop from actually taking the lead, from taking risks and learning from mistakes. Learn how to delegate and motivate; organise and chastise; praise and raise.
* Don't assume that your way of leading will immediately win over colleagues. It may even alienate them. Keep working on your communication skills. You don't have to be liked - but your ideas and accomplishments do.
* Be visible and accessible to those who are important. But bear in mind * You don't have to lead all the time. Be clear on where your contribution is vital and how you can help others to develop as leaders.",C1,"Career Power. Be a good leader. A leader helps people and makes changes. It is not about being tall or very smart. A good leader is excited and makes others excited too. They speak with strong belief. Many people can be leaders. They need to learn and use their skills. Think about a good boss and a bad boss. A good boss helps you and makes you feel good. A bad boss makes you feel small and does not share information. Leaders and managers are different. Managers follow rules. Leaders make new rules. You can learn to be a better leader. Find what you love. Think of yourself as a leader. Sometimes, you must be strong and lead. Set goals and do better than them. Leadership needs action. Take risks and learn. Talk well to others. Be seen and help important people. You do not have to lead all the time.","Career Power. Get ahead by motivating yourself to control your work. What is a good leader? A leader inspires people, brings change, and shows the way. It is not about height or just intelligence. A writer says leadership is making things happen with enthusiastic people. Enthusiasm is key, so a leader must speak clearly and with confidence. Another expert says most people have hidden leadership skills. They need to find and use them. Everyone can be a leader in the right situation. It is important in management. Think of your best and worst boss. Both might set goals and meet deadlines, but the best motivates and supports you. The worst makes you feel unimportant and blames you. Leaders and managers are different. Managers work within set limits, while leaders create new ones. A good manager can run a company smoothly, but a good leader can change a sad organization. To improve your leadership, find your passions and act on them. See yourself as a leader. Sometimes, lead firmly and try new styles. Set goals and beat them. Leadership comes from taking charge, taking risks, and learning. Communicate well to win others over. Be visible and help key people, but you do not have to lead all the time.","Career Power: Gain an advantage by motivating yourself to take full control at work. What defines a good leader? A leader inspires others, acts as an agent of change, and guides progress. Leadership is not determined by physical traits like height, as early theories suggested, nor is it solely about intelligence. According to Pat Dixon, author of 'Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,' leadership involves making things happen through people who share your enthusiasm. To convey and foster this enthusiasm, a leader must speak articulately and with conviction, expressing beliefs confidently. John van Maurik, a leadership course director, notes that most people have untapped leadership potential; becoming a leader requires recognizing, developing, and applying these talents. While it is easy to see leadership in famous figures, it can be harder to apply it to one's own workplace, yet it is essential for effective management. Reflect on your best and worst bosses; both may have been competent in tasks, but the best motivated and supported you, whereas the worst made you feel insignificant and withheld information, blaming you for failures. Leaders and managers differ: managers operate within established boundaries, while leaders create new horizons. Improving leadership skills involves discovering your passions, viewing yourself as a leader, experimenting with styles, setting and exceeding goals, and learning from risks and mistakes. Effective communication is crucial to avoid alienating colleagues, and being accessible to key individuals is important, but leadership is not required constantly.","Career Power: Attain a leading edge by motivating yourself to assume complete control in your professional life. What constitutes an effective leader? A leader is someone who inspires, serves as a catalyst for change, and charts the course forward. Leadership is not contingent on inherent qualities such as stature or superior intelligence, contrary to early beliefs. Pat Dixon, in her book 'Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,' asserts that leadership entails achieving outcomes through individuals who are as enthusiastic and engaged as oneself. Conveying and cultivating this enthusiasm necessitates articulate and conviction-filled communication, where confidence replaces hesitation. John van Maurik, director of a leadership course, emphasizes that most individuals possess latent leadership capabilities far beyond their awareness; the journey to leadership involves identifying, honing, and deploying these talents. Although leadership is readily observable in prominent historical or business figures, its relevance to one's own work environment may be less apparent, yet it is regarded as the cornerstone of proficient management. Consider your experiences with superiors: the exemplary leader motivates and bolsters your efforts, while the inferior one induces a sense of insignificance, withholds critical information, and attributes blame erroneously. Leaders and managers are distinct; managers excel within predefined parameters, whereas leaders forge new frontiers. Enhancing leadership skills entails aligning with personal passions, adopting a leader identity, varying leadership approaches, establishing and surpassing objectives, and deriving insights from taking initiative and errors. Leadership development hinges on practical application, risk-taking, and refinement of delegation, motivation, and communication to garner support without necessarily seeking popularity. Maintain visibility and accessibility to pivotal individuals, but exercise discernment in when to lead, focusing on essential contributions and fostering leadership in others.","Career Power

What delineates an exemplary leader? A leader is an inspirational figure, an instigator of transformation, and a visionary who delineates the trajectory of progress. Leadership is not predicated on hereditary factors or physical attributes such as height—a notion espoused by early theorists—nor is it merely a function of intellectual acuity. Pat Dixon, author of 'Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,' posits that leadership involves effectuating outcomes through cohorts who are equally fervent and invested. To propagate and nurture this ardor, a proficient leader must articulate with eloquence and unwavering conviction, eschewing tentative expressions for assertive declarations. John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, contends that the majority of individuals harbor a profound, often unrealized, potential for leadership; the process of ascension to leadership necessitates the recognition, cultivation, and application of these dormant aptitudes. While leadership is easily discernible in monumental contexts, exemplified by icons such as Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, its pertinence to the quotidian professional sphere may be more elusive, yet it is esteemed as the fundamental pillar of efficacious management. Reflect upon the most and least commendable supervisors you have encountered; both may have demonstrated proficiency in establishing objectives and adhering to temporal and fiscal constraints, but the superior leader would have invigorated your motivation and proffered sustenance, whereas the inferior would have engendered a sensation of being a minor component in corporate apparatus, concealing intelligence and imputing culpability for mishaps. Leaders and managers are disparate entities: managers derive satisfaction from operating within established confines, while leaders conceive their own horizons. Enhancing one's leadership proficiencies, irrespective of hierarchical standing, involves heeding definitive precepts: leadership flourishes through volition, thus identify your passions and convictions and harness that impetus; reconceptualize your self-perception to incorporate leadership as an intrinsic capability; while collaboration has its merits, there are junctures that demand resolute leadership—experiment with stylistic variations to observe altered outcomes; establish ambitious goals and surpass them to augment efficacy and career trajectory. Leadership does not materialize spontaneously; it evolves from actively assuming command, embracing risks, and assimilating lessons from errors. Refine abilities in delegation, motivation, organization, and discipline, while balancing praise and elevation. Do not presuppose that your leadership modus operandi will instantly garner collegial allegiance; it may even provoke alienation, necessitating persistent refinement of communicative faculties—your ideas and achievements must resonate, even if personal affability is secondary. Maintain prominence and approachability for consequential individuals, but exercise judicious restraint, as perpetual leadership is not requisite; delineate where your input is indispensable and facilitate the development of leadership in others."
235,"Science flying in the face of gravity

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories.

It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft.
But appearances were deceptive and the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel.
There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places with the air of condemned men.
For 12 months, they had competed with other students from across the continent to participate in the flight. The challenge, offered by the European Space Agency, had been to suggest imaginative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions.
Those with the best ideas won a place on this unusual flight, which is best described as the most extraordinary roller-coaster ride yet devised. For the next two hours the Boeing's flight would resemble that of an enormous bird which had lost its reason, shooting upwards towards the heavens before hurtling towards Earth.
The intention was to achieve a kind of state of grace at the top of each curve. As the pilot cuts the engines at 3,000 metres, the aircraft throws itself still higher by virtue of its own momentum before gravity takes over and it plummets earthwards again.
In the few silent seconds between ascending and falling, the aircraft and everything inside it become weightless, and the 13 students would, in theory, feel themselves closer to the moon than the Earth. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor.
Then the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. For 20 seconds we conducted a ghostly dance in the unreal silence:the floor had become a vast trampoline, and one footstep was enough to launch us headlong towards the ceiling.
We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else.
After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.
Our first curve completed, there were those who turned green at the thought of the 29 to follow. Thirty curves added up to ten minutes 'space time' for experiments and the Dutch students were soon studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, hoping to discover how it is that cats always land on their feet.
At the appropriate moment the device they had built to investigate this was released, floating belly-up, and one of the students succeeded in turning it belly-down with radio-controlled movements. The next curve was nearly its last, however, when another student landed on top of it during a less well managed return to gravitational pull.
Next to the slightly stunned acrobatic robocat, a German team from the University of Aachen investigated how the quality of joins in metal is affected by the absence of gravity, with an eye to the construction of tomorrow's space stations.
Another team of students, from Utah State University, examined the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened in ultra-violet sunlight. Their flight was spent attempting to produce the films under microgravity. They believe that once the process is perfected, satellites could be equipped with solar sails that use the sun's radiation just as a yacht's sails use the wind. 
After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.
This was a feeling that would stay with us for a long time. 'It was an unforgettable experience,' said one of the students. 'I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more.'",C1,A plane flies in a special way. It goes up and down. Students are on the plane. They do tests when there is no gravity.

The plane flies up and down like a roller coaster. When it goes up high and stops engines, everything becomes weightless. The students float and test a robotic cat and metal joints. They also work on solar sails for satellites. After the flight, they feel excited and want to be astronauts more.","Science challenges gravity on a unique flight. Journalist Tom Mumford accompanies students testing theories in weightlessness. The aircraft is a Boeing KC-135 from 1964, modified inside with padded walls and few seats. These students from Europe and America won a competition by the European Space Agency for their creative experiments. The flight involves steep climbs and dives, creating brief periods of weightlessness. During these moments, the students float and conduct experiments, such as studying a robotic cat's movements, examining metal joints for space stations, and developing solar sails from liquid films. Despite some discomfort, the experience was exhilarating and inspiring for their future careers.","In an experiment defying gravity, journalist Tom Mumford observes students utilizing weightlessness to validate their hypotheses. The aircraft, a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker constructed in 1964, appears conventional externally but is internally transformed into a stark, illuminated tunnel with minimal seating. Selected through a competitive process by the European Space Agency, the students embark on a flight characterized by abrupt ascents and descents, simulating a roller-coaster to induce weightlessness. During these ephemeral intervals, they investigate diverse phenomena: the mechanics of a robotic cat landing on its feet, the integrity of metal joints in microgravity for potential space infrastructure, and the fabrication of solar sails from ultraviolet-hardened liquid films to propel satellites. The ordeal, though nauseating for some, culminated in profound exhilaration and reinforced aspirations toward astronautics.","Science flying in the face of gravity

After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.
Our first curve completed, there were those who turned green at the thought of the 29 to follow. Thirty curves added up to ten minutes 'space time' for experiments and the Dutch students were soon studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, hoping to discover how it is that cats always land on their feet.
At the appropriate moment the device they had built to investigate this was released, floating belly-up, and one of the students succeeded in turning it belly-down with radio-controlled movements. The next curve was nearly its last, however, when another student landed on top of it during a less well managed return to gravitational pull.
Next to the slightly stunned acrobatic robocat, a German team from the University of Aachen investigated how the quality of joins in metal is affected by the absence of gravity, with an eye to the construction of tomorrow's space stations.
Another team of students, from Utah State University, examined the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened in ultra-violet sunlight. Their flight was spent attempting to produce the films under microgravity. They believe that once the process is perfected, satellites could be equipped with solar sails that use the sun's radiation just as a yacht's sails use the wind. 
After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.
This was a feeling that would stay with us for a long time. 'It was an unforgettable experience,' said one of the students. 'I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more.'","Science confronts gravitational forces as journalist Tom Mumford partakes in a flight where students empirically test their theories under conditions of weightlessness. Externally, the vessel resembled a standard aircraft—a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, dating from 1964 and derived from the 707 airliner—yet its interior was starkly reconfigured into an elongated, luminous tunnel with padded surfaces and scant seating. These thirteen scholars, hailing from Europe and America, had triumphed in a pan-continental competition orchestrated by the European Space Agency, proposing innovative experiments for microgravity environments. The flight trajectory mimicked an irrational avian ascent and plunge, achieving momentary weightlessness at each parabolic apex when engines were disengaged, allowing the craft to coast inertiaally before succumbing to gravitational pull. In these transient silences, occupants experienced ethereal buoyancy, conducting investigations into feline robotics for equilibrium studies, metallurgical joint quality pertinent to orbital construction, and the development of solar sails from liquid polymers cured by ultraviolet radiation, envisioning satellite propulsion analogous to maritime winds. Despite visceral disorientation, the overarching sentiment was one of elation, profoundly intensifying career ambitions in astronautics."
236,"The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action.

One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. 'Hasn't even acknowledged us,' Sue Brown says out of the corner of her mouth. 'Very poor.' It is a classic arrival-phase error, and one that Sue has encountered scores of times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't an ordinary three-star place,' she protests. 'It has three red stars, and I would expect better.'
To be the possessor of red stars means that the Globe is rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide published by the organisation she works for. However, even before our frosty welcome, a chill has entered the air. Access from the car park has been via an unmanned door, operated by an impersonal buzzer, followed by a long, twisting, deserted corridor leading to the hotel entrance. 'Again, not what I had expected,' says Sue.
Could things get worse? They could. 'We seem to have no record of your booking,' announces the receptionist, in her best sing-song how-may-I-help-you voice.
It turns out that a dozen of the hotel's 15 rooms are unoccupied that night. One is on the top floor. It is not to the inspector's taste: stuffiness is one criticism, the other is a gaping panel at the back of the wardrobe, behind which is a large hole in the wall.
When she began her inspecting career, she named an early reputation for toughness. 'The Woman in Black, I was known as,' she recalls, 'which was funny, because I never used to wear black. And I've never been too tough.' Not that you would know it the next morning when, after paying her bill, she suddenly reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves.
From the look on his face, her arrival has caused terror.
Even before she says anything else, he expresses abject apologies for the unpleasant smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocks drain there,' he sighs. 'The whole floor will probably have to come up.` Sue gently suggests that as well as sorting out the plumbing, he might also prevail upon his staff not to usher guests into the room so readily. 'Best, perhaps, to steer them to the other lounge.' she says. Greaves nods with glum enthusiasm and gamely takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months, and you can see him struggling to believe Sue when she says that this dissection of the hotel can only be for the good of the place in the long run.
Not that it's all on the negative side. Singled out for commendation are Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who dished out a sheaf of notes about the building's 400-year history. Dinner, too, has done enough to maintain the hotel's two-rosette food rating, thereby encouraging Greaves to push his luck a bit. 'So what do we have to do to get three rosettes?' he enquires. Sue's suggestions include: 'Not serve a pudding that collapses.' The brief flicker of light in Greaves' eyes goes out.
It is Sue Brown's unenviable job to voice the complaints the rest of us more cowardly consumers do not have the courage to articulate. 'Sometimes one can be treading on very delicate ground. I remember, in one case, a woman rang to complain I'd got her son the sack. All I could say was the truth, which was that he'd served me apple pie with his fingers.' Comeback letters involve spurious allegations of everything, from a superior attitude to demanding bribes. 'You come to expect it after a while, but it hurts every time,' she says.
Sue is required not just to relate her findings to the hotelier verbally, but also to send them a full written report. They are, after all, paying for the privilege of her putting them straight. (There is an annual fee for inclusion in the guide.) Nevertheless, being singled out for red-star treatment makes it more than worthwhile. So it is reassuring for Greaves to hear that Sue is not going to recommend that the Globe be stripped of its red stars. That is the good news. The bad is that another inspector will be back in the course of the next two months to make sure that everything has been put right. 'Good,' smiles Greaves unconvincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.'",C1,Sue Brown checks hotels for her job. She went to the Globe Hotel. The hotel worker did not see Sue. Sue said this was bad. The hotel has three red stars. This means it is a very good hotel. But Sue did not like the way in from the car park. The hotel worker said she did not have Sue's booking. Many rooms were empty. Sue saw a room she did not like. It was stuffy and had a hole in the wall. Sue told the hotel manager who she was. He looked scared. He said sorry for a bad smell in a room. Sue said to fix the smell and not use that room. The manager wrote notes. Sue said some hotel workers were good. The food was good. The manager asked how to get a better food rating. Sue said to not serve a bad pudding. The manager looked sad. Sue's job is to say what is wrong. Sometimes people get angry with her. She writes a report for the hotel. She said the hotel can keep its red stars. But another person will check the hotel again soon.,"Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She visited the Globe Hotel to check it. At the start, the receptionist did not notice Sue, which Sue said was very poor. The hotel has three red stars, meaning it is one of the top hotels in a guide. However, Sue was not happy with the entrance from the car park, which had a buzzer and a long, empty corridor. The receptionist also said there was no record of Sue's booking. Most rooms were empty that night. Sue saw a room on the top floor that was stuffy and had a big hole behind the wardrobe. Sue told the manager, Robin Greaves, who she was, and he looked terrified. He apologized for a bad smell in the lounge, saying there might be a blocked drain. Sue advised him to fix it and not use that room for guests. The manager took notes and tried to believe that the inspection would help the hotel. Sue praised some staff, like Emma and Trudy, and said the food was good enough to keep its rating. The manager asked how to get a higher food rating, and Sue said to avoid serving a pudding that falls apart. Sue's job involves giving honest feedback, which sometimes makes people angry, but she writes reports for the hotels. She told the manager the hotel could keep its red stars, but another inspector would return to check if problems were fixed.","Sue Brown works as a hotel inspector, and Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection of the Globe Hotel. Immediately, issues arose: the receptionist failed to acknowledge Sue, which Sue criticized as a common error in her 11 years of experience. The Globe Hotel has three red stars, indicating it is among the top 130 hotels in a guide of 4,000, but Sue was disappointed with the impersonal entrance from the car park, involving a buzzer and a deserted corridor. The receptionist then claimed there was no booking for Sue, despite many rooms being unoccupied. Sue inspected a room on the top floor that was stuffy and had a large hole behind the wardrobe. She revealed her identity to the manager, Robin Greaves, who appeared frightened and apologized for a foul smell in the lounge, possibly due to a blocked drain. Sue suggested fixing the plumbing and avoiding that room for guests. Greaves, who had only been manager for five months, took notes and struggled to accept that the inspection would benefit the hotel long-term. On a positive note, Sue commended staff members Emma and Trudy, and the dinner maintained the hotel's food rating. When Greaves inquired about improving to three rosettes, Sue advised against serving collapsing puddings. Sue's role involves voicing criticisms that others avoid, sometimes leading to complaints, but she provides detailed reports. She assured Greaves the hotel would not lose its red stars, though another inspection would follow to ensure improvements.","Sue Brown, a professional hotel inspector, was accompanied by Christopher Middleton during her assessment of the Globe Hotel. From the outset, problems were evident: the receptionist, unaware of Sue's identity, ignored her, an error Sue deemed very poor and typical in her career. The hotel boasts three red stars, signifying its elite status among 4,000 in the guide, yet Sue found the access from the car park—via an unmanned door with a buzzer and a long, twisting corridor—disappointing. The receptionist then asserted there was no record of Sue's booking, even though most rooms were vacant. Sue examined a top-floor room that was stuffy and had a gaping panel in the wardrobe revealing a hole in the wall. She disclosed her role to the manager, Robin Greaves, whose face showed terror; he immediately apologized for a unpleasant smell in the main lounge, attributing it to a potentially blocked drain. Sue recommended addressing the plumbing and steering guests away from that room. Greaves, relatively new to his position, took notes with glum enthusiasm, grappling with the idea that the critique would ultimately benefit the hotel. Sue praised specific staff, such as Emma and Trudy, who provided historical notes, and noted that dinner upheld the two-rosette food rating. When Greaves asked about achieving three rosettes, Sue pointed out the need to avoid desserts that collapse. Her job entails articulating criticisms that timid consumers avoid, sometimes provoking hostile responses, but she delivers comprehensive reports. She informed Greaves that the red stars would remain, though a follow-up inspection would occur to verify corrections.","The Hotel Inspector

237,"Seven Up

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits.

My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

We were in a snow cave 91m below the summit when my climbing partner, Dougal Haston, began a conversation with Dave Clark, our Equipment Officer, about the relative merits of various sleeping bags. I thought this was strange, as only Dougal and I were present. Putting this down to oxygen deprivation, I then found myself talking to my feet. Already the cold was getting into the balls of my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite. It wasn't survival that was worrying us so much as the quality of our survival.
Over the next two days I relived our time spent on the summit ridge. I realised that I couldn't have been there with a better man than Dougal Hatton. He inspired great confidence in me and by now I was climbing with a calm presentiment mat somehow or other it was all going to work out. I realised I had to get a better rhythm going in order to reach the summit - which is what I did.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. In April 1976 Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days humping equipment and food up to the base. Only after the first day of climbing did we realise the enormity of our undertaking. On the lower face we followed a route put up in 1967, but at half height we pursued a new route, as planned, heading directly for the upper snow basin and the summit. We decided to climb
'alpine style', with our equipment and food on our backs. It would be the first time a major new route had been climbed here in such a way.
We climbed up the compressed snow of an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff and by the third day my sleeping bag was sodden. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering. Mt. McKinley, because the air pressure in the polar regions is lower, has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. It seemed to us that we were up at around 7,000m, instead of 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with the intention of climbing Mt. Kenya. It was though the unexpected offer of a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro that we came to climb Africa's highest mountain.
On our approach we got ourselves lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes. Our situation became serious because water is scarce. On the second day we came across luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish which brought us to a rock pool. Never before had I been so pleased to find rubbish on a mountain.
We attempted a direct start to the breach wall, which is a 305m-high icicle. After a deluge of falling rock and ice we prudently retired and opted instead for the Umbwe route to gain the surrealistic summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a party up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the busy standard route, and suggested that we go with them.
After three days of sitting out bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier stretching up to the summit had been swept by vicious winds and glistened with pure ice. With a time limit to get back to Buenos Aires for our flight, we decided to miss out on the glacier. Instead we went across the north ridges towards the standard route and joined the large number of people wandering along the path. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit and just before it got dark we camped outside the refuge.
Back at base camp we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and felt, when they learnt that I had already climbed four, that I should do me same. This was the first time I had seriously thought about such goal-orientation -- something I had previously tried to avoid.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality. Our team left Britain towards the end of November 1992 and travelled the thousands of kilometres to the South Pole. At this time of the year the sun is always well above the horizon, throughout the day and night, and when the wind stops blowing it is utterly quiet. As in other polar regions, in the keen, clean air, there is such an invigorating atmosphere that the spirits are raised just by being there. On December 7 we left camp and headed off towards the summit. Against expectations, with winds gusting at around 80 kms per hour and temperatures below minus 50degC, we all got to the top within 8 hours. Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

Our team assembled in St Petersburg during the early summer of 1994. On our arrival at the settlement of Terskol, beneath Elbrus, a commission was demanded from our guide for bringing foreigners into the valley, though this was later waived. 
After a few days' acclimatising, the group set off up Elbrus by cableway to 3,900m. From there we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-
afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day descended this, fortunately extinct, volcano.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

On our expedition to Carstensz we hoped not only to establish a new route but to spend as much time as possible with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, regarded as sacred by the local tribespeople.
We had been warned that we might be taken hostage or even killed by bandits but, undeterred, we left our hut by mid-morning and walked down winding lanes towards the jungle. On May 12 we stayed climbing. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We were slower, since Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am. 
I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!",C1,"Doug Scott is a mountain climber. He tells his story about climbing the highest mountains on seven continents.

Elbrus in Europe, G. Carstensz Pyramid in Australasia. On Mt. Everest, he was very cold and talked to his feet because of low oxygen. He climbed with Dougal Haston and felt safe with him. On Mt. McKinley, it was very hard and felt higher than it was. They carried all their things and made a new way up. On Kilimanjaro, they got lost but found water and climbed a different way. On Aconcagua, he met friends and did not climb the icy part because of time. People told him to climb all seven mountains. On Vinson Massif, he went to Antarctica with a team. It was very cold and windy, but they reached the top. On Elbrus, they took a cable car and walked, but the summit was far. On Carstensz Pyramid, they met local people and climbed to the top. Everyone cheered for him on the seventh mountain.","Mountaineer Doug Scott shares his experiences of climbing the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. He climbed them in this order: A.

He remembered frostbite dangers and focused on surviving well. He climbed with Dougal Haston, who gave him confidence. On Mt. McKinley, it is very dangerous. They carried equipment and made a new route. The mountain felt higher due to low air pressure. They suffered but reached the summit. On Kilimanjaro, they planned to climb Mt. Kenya but went to Kilimanjaro for free. They got lost in the jungle but found water from rubbish marks. They tried a direct climb but changed to a safer route. On Aconcagua, the normal route is easy. He met a guide and joined a group to avoid crowds. Bad weather delayed them, and they skipped the icy glacier due to time. Other climbers suggested he climb all seven summits. On Vinson Massif, he financed the trip by guiding others. In Antarctica, it was always light and quiet. They climbed in strong wind and cold but reached the top quickly, though visibility was poor. On Elbrus, they went by cable car and walked to a refuge. They thought they reached the summit but had to go further. They returned in the dark. On Carstensz Pyramid, they wanted to make a new route and meet local people. They were warned about bandits but climbed safely. Scott reached the summit and was cheered for completing the seven summits.","Mountaineer Doug Scott describes his mystical journey of conquering the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. He recounts them in the order he climbed: A. Mt. Everest in Asia, B. Mt. McKinley in North America, C. Kilimanjaro in Africa, D. Aconcagua in South America, E. Vinson Massif in Antarctica, F. Elbrus in Europe, G. Carstensz Pyramid in Australasia. On Mt. Everest, while in a snow cave below the summit, his partner Dougal Haston began speaking to their equipment officer who wasn't present, likely due to oxygen deprivation. Scott also talked to his feet, worrying about frostbite from the cold. He reflected on their time on the summit ridge, feeling confident with Haston and adjusting his rhythm to reach the top. On Mt. McKinley, considered the most treacherous mountain, they arrived at the glacier, carried equipment, and realized the challenge's scale. They followed an old route initially but pioneered a new one alpine style, carrying all gear. The low polar air pressure made it feel like 7,000m, causing suffering, but they succeeded. On Kilimanjaro, they intended to climb Mt. Kenya but took a free opportunity to Kilimanjaro. Lost in dense jungles with water scarcity, they found guidance from painted arrows and rubbish leading to a pool. After a hazardous attempt on a icicle wall, they prudently switched to the Umbwe route for the summit. On Aconcagua, the standard route is straightforward. Meeting guide Phil Erscheler, they avoided crowds via the Polish Glacier but skipped it due to bad weather and time constraints, joining others on the north ridges. Other climbers inspired him to pursue the Seven Summits goal. On Vinson Massif, financing the trip through guiding made the quest feasible. In Antarctica, with perpetual daylight and silence, they summited in harsh winds and extreme cold, though storm reduced visibility. On Elbrus, after acclimatization and cable car travel, they faced windy, icy slopes and mistakenly thought they had summited before discovering a longer ridge. On Carstensz Pyramid, aiming for a new route and interaction with the Dani people, they ignored bandit warnings, climbed in rock shoes, and Scott received applause on his seventh summit, completing his mission.","Mountaineer Doug Scott elucidates his mystical endeavor to ascend the Seven Summits, the paramount peaks on each continent, chronicling them sequentially: A. Mt. Everest in Asia, B. Mt. McKinley in North America, C. Kilimanjaro in Africa, D. Aconcagua in South America, E. Vinson Massif in Antarctica, F. Elbrus in Europe, G. Carstensz Pyramid in Australasia. On Mt. Everest, ensconced in a snow cave proximate to the summit, his companion Dougal Haston engaged in a discourse with their absent equipment officer, an anomaly Scott attributed to oxygen deprivation, while he himself conversed with his feet, cognizant of frostbite perils. He retrospectively contemplated their summit ridge experience, deriving assurance from Haston's presence and refining his climbing rhythm to achieve the apex. On Mt. McKinley, deemed the world's most perilous mountain, they commenced by transporting provisions to the base, swiftly apprehending the undertaking's magnitude. Adhering initially to an established route, they diverged to forge a novel path alpine style, a pioneering feat for the locale. The reduced atmospheric pressure in polar regions exacerbated the physiological strain, simulating an altitude of 7,000m, yet they persevered to triumph. On Kilimanjaro, originally bound for Mt. Kenya, an unforeseen offer diverted them to Kilimanjaro. Disoriented in impenetrable jungles amid water scarcity, they serendipitously encountered luminous markers and detritus guiding them to a rock pool. After an abortive assault on a formidable icicle, they judiciously elected the Umbwe route to attain the surreal summit. On Aconcagua, where the conventional ascent is largely pedestrian, he serendipitously met guide Phil Erscheler and accompanied his party to evade the trodden path via the Polish Glacier; however, inclement weather and temporal constraints compelled a detour to the north ridges, where interactions with fellow mountaineers catalyzed his commitment to the Seven Summits objective. On Vinson Massif, the feasibility emerged through financing via guided expeditions. In Antarctica's ceaseless diurnal light and profound stillness, they surmounted the summit against anticipations, grappling with vehement winds and sub-zero temperatures, though their elation was mitigated by obscured visibility. On Elbrus, after assemblage and acclimatization, they utilized cable transport and confronted gusty, glaciated terrain, initially misconstruing an intermediate point as the summit before discerning the veritable peak along a protracted ridge. On Carstensz Pyramid, aspiring to establish an innovative route and engage with the indigenous Dani populace amidst encroachments from a gold mine, they proceeded undaunted by security advisories, ascending efficiently to the summit where Scott was accorded a standing ovation, thereby fulfilling his aspirational goal.","Seven Up

Over the next two days I relived our time spent on the summit ridge. I realised that I couldn't have been there with a better man than Dougal Hatton. He inspired great confidence in me and by now I was climbing with a calm presentiment mat somehow or other it was all going to work out. I realised I had to get a better rhythm going in order to reach the summit - which is what I did.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. In April 1976 Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days humping equipment and food up to the base. Only after the first day of climbing did we realise the enormity of our undertaking. On the lower face we followed a route put up in 1967, but at half height we pursued a new route, as planned, heading directly for the upper snow basin and the summit. We decided to climb
'alpine style', with our equipment and food on our backs. It would be the first time a major new route had been climbed here in such a way.
We climbed up the compressed snow of an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff and by the third day my sleeping bag was sodden. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering. Mt. McKinley, because the air pressure in the polar regions is lower, has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. It seemed to us that we were up at around 7,000m, instead of 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with the intention of climbing Mt. Kenya. It was though the unexpected offer of a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro that we came to climb Africa's highest mountain.
On our approach we got ourselves lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes. Our situation became serious because water is scarce. On the second day we came across luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish which brought us to a rock pool. Never before had I been so pleased to find rubbish on a mountain.
We attempted a direct start to the breach wall, which is a 305m-high icicle. After a deluge of falling rock and ice we prudently retired and opted instead for the Umbwe route to gain the surrealistic summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a party up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the busy standard route, and suggested that we go with them.
After three days of sitting out bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier stretching up to the summit had been swept by vicious winds and glistened with pure ice. With a time limit to get back to Buenos Aires for our flight, we decided to miss out on the glacier. Instead we went across the north ridges towards the standard route and joined the large number of people wandering along the path. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit and just before it got dark we camped outside the refuge.
Back at base camp we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and felt, when they learnt that I had already climbed four, that I should do me same. This was the first time I had seriously thought about such goal-orientation -- something I had previously tried to avoid.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality. Our team left Britain towards the end of November 1992 and travelled the thousands of kilometres to the South Pole. At this time of the year the sun is always well above the horizon, throughout the day and night, and when the wind stops blowing it is utterly quiet. As in other polar regions, in the keen, clean air, there is such an invigorating atmosphere that the spirits are raised just by being there. On December 7 we left camp and headed off towards the summit. Against expectations, with winds gusting at around 80 kms per hour and temperatures below minus 50degC, we all got to the top within 8 hours. Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

Our team assembled in St Petersburg during the early summer of 1994. On our arrival at the settlement of Terskol, beneath Elbrus, a commission was demanded from our guide for bringing foreigners into the valley, though this was later waived. 
After a few days' acclimatising, the group set off up Elbrus by cableway to 3,900m. From there we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-
afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day descended this, fortunately extinct, volcano.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

On our expedition to Carstensz we hoped not only to establish a new route but to spend as much time as possible with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, regarded as sacred by the local tribespeople.
We had been warned that we might be taken hostage or even killed by bandits but, undeterred, we left our hut by mid-morning and walked down winding lanes towards the jungle. On May 12 we stayed climbing. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We were slower, since Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am. 
I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!","Mountaineer Doug Scott imparts to his readership the esoteric experience of vanquishing the septet of continental apexes: the Seven Summits. His belated odyssey unfolded in the sequence of his ascents: A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m), B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m), C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m), D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m), E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m), F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m), G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m). On Everest, sequestered in a snow cave mere meters subjacent to the summit, his comrade Dougal Haston initiated a colloquy with the spectral presence of their Equipment Officer, a phenomenon Scott ascribed to hypoxic delirium, while he himself engaged in soliloquy with his extremities, acutely aware of incipient frostbite and the imperative of qualitative survival. During subsequent reflection, he apprehended the indispensability of Haston's camaraderie and calibrated his cadence to effectuate the summit attainment. On McKinley, reputed as the globe's most insidious peak, they confronted the enormity of their venture after laborious provisioning, eschewing established paths to pioneer an alpine-style ascent, a seminal achievement exacerbated by the disproportionate physiological impact of polar barometric conditions, which simulated loftier altitudes. On Kilimanjaro, an unanticipated diversion from Mt. Kenya led them through labyrinthine jungles, where dire hydration concerns were alleviated by fortuitous discoveries of luminescent sigils and anthropogenic refuse, culminating in a prudent retreat from a hazardous icicle ascent in favor of the Umbwe route. On Aconcagua, the pedestrian standard route was circumvented through association with Phil Erscheler's contingent, yet vicissitudes of meteorology and temporal exigencies precluded traversal of the Polish Glacier, diverting them to the populous north ridges, where exhortations from fellow alpinists crystallized his goal-orientation. On Vinson Massif, the economic viability via guided patronage rendered the septuple quest tangible; in Antarctica's perpetual luminescence and sepulchral quietude, they defied prognostications to summit amidst tempestuous winds and cryogenic temperatures, though their jubilation was attenuated by severely restricted visibility. On Elbrus, after bureaucratic impediments were rescinded, acclimatization and mechanical ascent preceded a grueling traverse of windswept, verglassed slopes, with the actual summit eluding initial perception beyond a protracted ridge. On Carstensz Pyramid, ambitions encompassed both route innovation and cultural immersion with the Dani aboriginals, notwithstanding admonitions of banditry; ascending adeptly in rock footwear, Scott was feted with a standing ovation upon consummating his heptadic objective, thereby actualizing his mission."

The second theory emphasizes cognitive benefits, proposing that sleep processes daily information and facilitates learning. The third theory focuses on energy conservation, arguing that sleep recharges our energy reserves for future activities.","Given that individuals devote around one-third of their lives to sleep, it is evident that sleep fulfills an essential role. Nonetheless, there is no consensus among scientists regarding its precise function. Three predominant theories have been proposed. The most widely accepted theory posits that sleep's functions are primarily physiological, involving the repair of daily bodily wear and tear and the restoration of optimal functioning. An alternative theory highlights the cognitive advantages of sleep, maintaining that it enables the consolidation of information acquired throughout the day and is indispensable for learning. A third theory centers on energy metabolism, suggesting that sleep periods are necessary to replenish energy stores, thereby ensuring adequate vigor for subsequent endeavors.","Three theories about sleep

The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support

If you applied for a job in some countries, you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting, as much as anything else, that would determine your suitability for the job.
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting analysis is increasingly being used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions.
She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'
According to Ms Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.

The person behind the handwriting: examples analysed by graphologist Patricia Marne. 'I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.'

'Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.'
Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred.'
A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.
Ms Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form 'threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting - how far the writer has deviated from copybook script - indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.
Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronising attitude.
Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately, and this has to be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels that more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing.
This will happen soon, she believes. 'It's actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.'
Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them.

In various countries, job applicants are frequently obliged to submit a handwriting specimen, which may substantially determine their appropriateness for the role.

Investigators assert that it serves as a valuable instrument for detecting ailments like heart disease and cancer, and for disclosing psychological conditions and emotional disturbances.

Nonetheless, the majority of medical practitioners and psychiatrists persist in their skepticism regarding graphology's efficacy. Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over two decades of professional experience, contends that it warrants greater consideration. She maintains that handwriting can reveal psychological attributes as well as specific medical issues. Ms. Marne posits that handwriting is a potent indicator of social stratification and intellect, and it can evaluate cognitive capabilities, aptitudes for arts or sciences, and whether an individual possesses a duplicitous or forthright nature. Graphology proves especially beneficial in appraising potential criminal proclivities; offenders typically exhibit disordered, poorly formed handwriting that mirrors impoverished backgrounds and stunted emotional maturation. It can also forewarn of imminent violence, intolerable stress, or psychopathic inclinations, and even anticipate suicidal intentions. Cardiac and pulmonary complications might manifest if handwriting becomes tremulous or fragmented over a period, or if a signature develops previously absent discontinuities. Acute emotional distress can induce temporary alterations in signatures. Additional psychological characteristics include: script where letters form threads, denoting cunning and intelligence; predominant use of capital letters, suggesting concealment of authentic identity; very light pressure, indicating sensitivity and diminished vitality; originality in penmanship, reflecting self-assurance and artistic talent; and disconnected writing, emblematic of isolation. Diminutive signatures signify inhibition and an inferiority complex; circular dots over 'i's represent a quest for attention; and heavily crossed 't's spanning entire words denote intolerance and a condescending demeanor. Ms. Marne emphasizes that proficient analysis necessitates six years of dedicated study and practical experience, coupled with empathy and intuition, and she advocates for further research to solidify graphology's scientific foundation. She is convinced of its superiority over psychoanalysis, as it can elucidate an individual's complete history, including all emotional crises, without the ambiguity of self-reported responses. However, this perspective is met with robust criticism from some psychiatrists, who argue that handwriting is merely a derivative of educational background, artistic propensity, and instructional techniques, devoid of any profound implications.","The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst

Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance.","The axiom that the pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst finds resonance in the burgeoning support for graphology, the study of handwriting as a means to elucidate character. In several nations, prospective employees are almost invariably compelled to furnish handwriting exemplars, which crucially inform assessments of their suitability for employment. Graphology is esteemed as an authentic scientific pursuit across many jurisdictions, with researchers advocating its utility in intimating pathologies such as cardiac and oncological conditions, alongside revelations of psychological dispositions and affective perturbations. Its deployment is progressively integral to vocational guidance and supplementary to interviews, with numerous conglomerates enlisting graphologists to dissect the chirography of aspirants for seminal roles. Notwithstanding, a preponderance of physicians and psychiatrists remains circumspect about graphology's veracity. Patricia Marne, a seasoned graphologist with over twenty years of practice, polemicizes for its enhanced credence, asserting that handwriting can betray psychological idiosyncrasies and particular morbidities. She avers that handwriting constitutes a formidable barometer of socioeconomic stratum and intellectual capacity, facilitating evaluations of cognitive prowess, proclivities toward the arts or sciences, and the dichotomy between guile and candor. Graphology is particularly efficacious in gauging latent criminal propensities; malefactors invariably exhibit disquieted, often illiterate and malformed script, reflective of deprived upbringings and arrested emotional ontogeny. It can presage impending violence, insufferable duress, or psychopathic tendencies, and even portend suicidal ideation. Cardiopulmonary afflictions may be evinced through script that becomes tremulous or desultory over time, or through nascent fractures in signatures, while acute emotional turmoil can induce ephemeral alterations in sigillary patterns. Further psychological delineations include: threaded letterforms, indicative of astuteness and duplicity; predominant capitalization, denoting dissimulation of veritable identity; exceedingly faint pressure, connoting hypersensitivity and enervation; originality in execution, bespeaking assurance and artistic endowment; and disconnected script, the quintessential hallmark of the solitary individual. Minuscule signatures imply inhibition and an inferiority complex; circumscribed dots atop 'i's constitute an overture for attention; and robustly crossed 't's traversing entire lexemes signify intolerance and a patronizing mien. Ms. Marne stipulates that meticulous analysis mandates a sextennium of erudition and experiential accrual, conjoined with empathic and intuitive faculties, and she exhorts for amplified inquiry to ensconce graphology upon a rigorous scientific pedestal. She contends that it surpasses psychoanalysis in precision, as it can unravel an individual's entire biographical tapestry, inclusive of all emotional cataclysms, sans the fallibility of interrogative responses. Nevertheless, such assertions are met with vehement oppugnation from certain psychiatrists, who dismiss handwriting as a mere artifact of pedagogical influences, artistic proclivities, and instructional methodologies, devoid of any intrinsic significance beyond these determinants."

A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world, none is native to either America or Australia. 
All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked, so that their spines point outwards. The effectiveness of this as a defence mechanism, depends, of course, on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort.

The efficacy of this defence mechanism is contingent upon the quantity of spines; certain desert hedgehogs have adapted with reduced spine counts, making them more inclined to evade predators by running, employing the rolling tactic as a final recourse. Hedgehogs are predominantly nocturnal, spending much of the day asleep in concealed locations such as beneath vegetation or within subterranean holes.

Hedgehogs are fundamentally nocturnal, slumbering extensively diurnally in refuges such as beneath shrubbery or within terrestrial cavities.

He disseminated the photographs in conjunction with an article he authored, wherein he conceded fairies as supernatural phenomena. It was only in 1939 that the two ladies who had executed the photographic endeavor confessed to their artifice; they had simply excised depictions of fairies from a publication and orchestrated their placement among floral arrangements. The resultant images are incontrovertibly aesthetically pleasing, but the elementary nature of the ruse subverts a cardinal tenet of photography—that the apparatus is incapable of prevarication. Yet, it can, and perpetually has been able to, deceive. In the modern epoch, we are habituated to computational software facilitating the reconfiguration of our digital imagery, and it is a fallacious notion that photography ever harbored a veracious epoch of guilelessness; from the moment cameras commenced capturing reality, that very reality was being transmuted."

243,"Volunteer tourism 

Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. 
 
A.
It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. Whilst volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, they have usually paid a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work: money that, if donated to a local community directly, could potentially pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide. This is especially so in the case of gap years, in which the level of technical skill or professional experience required of volunteers is negligible. Hence, it is unsurprising that many academic studies allude to the moral issue of whether gap year volunteering is principally motivated by altruism - a desire to benefit the society visited - or whether young people aim to generate 'cultural capital' which benefits them in their careers. However, the projects may play a role in developing people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off. 

B.
Volunteering may lead to greater international understanding; enhanced ability to solve conflicts; widespread and democratic participation in global affairs through global civic society organisations; and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. In this scenario, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, an outcome where benefits accrue to volunteers and host communities, and contribute to the global greater good. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work. Those who volunteer will continue to reap its benefits, using host organisations and host communities as a rung on the ladder of personal advancement. 

C.
At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, volunteer tourism, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities. Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development. 
 
 
D.
Volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble 'making a difference', can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate. The personal element appears positive - it bypasses big government and eschews big business. Yet it also bypasses the democratic imperative of representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity, most often ones that seek to work around rather than transform the situations of poor, rural societies. Cynicism at the act of volunteering is certainly misplaced. The act of volunteer tourism may involve only simple, commendable charity. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development. The politics of volunteer tourism represents a retreat from a social understanding of global inequalities and the poverty lived by so many in the developing word. ",C1,"Four writers talk about volunteer tourism. Volunteer tourists pay money to help in other countries. They build houses or schools. But the money could help more if given to local people. Young people on gap years may not have many skills. Some people think they help to be kind. Others think they do it for their jobs. Volunteering can help people learn about other countries. It can help solve problems. But only rich people can often do it. This helps them, not the poor. Sometimes volunteering is like old charity from rich countries. It can be good if it shares skills and culture. It can make people care about unfairness and poverty. Volunteer tourism is about helping others in a personal way. It is not about big government or business. But it may not change poor societies. It is good to help, but we should not say it fixes big problems.","Four academic writers discuss volunteer tourism. Volunteer tourists pay fees to do work like building homes in other countries. This money could pay for more local workers instead. On gap years, young volunteers often lack skills, so their help may be small. People debate if they volunteer to help others or to improve their careers. However, it might make them more ethical in life. Volunteering can increase international understanding, help resolve conflicts, and let people join global groups. Benefits go to volunteers and communities, but if only wealthy people volunteer, it helps them more, using host communities for personal gain. In bad cases, volunteering can be like imperialist charity or self-serving for Westerners. In good cases, it shares skills and culture, raising awareness of poverty and injustice. Volunteer tourism fits with personal helping strategies, avoiding big government and business. But it ignores democratic processes and reduces development to charity, not changing poor societies. While volunteering is good, overstating it as development weakens discussions on global inequalities.","Four academic writers examine international volunteer work. Volunteer tourists typically pay substantial fees to participate in activities such as constructing homes or schools. This money, if donated directly to local communities, could fund more labor than the volunteers provide, especially since gap-year volunteers often have minimal skills. Consequently, studies question whether the motivation is altruism or building cultural capital for careers. Nonetheless, it may foster ethical behavior in volunteers' future lives. Volunteering can enhance international understanding, conflict resolution abilities, and involvement in global civic society, creating collective benefits for volunteers and hosts. However, if limited to affluent individuals, it primarily advantages them, using host organizations for personal advancement. At its worst, volunteering can be paternalistic or self-serving; at its best, it facilitates skill exchange and raises lifelong commitment against inequality and poverty. Volunteer tourism aligns with personal aid approaches, appealing in anti-political contexts by avoiding large institutions. Yet, it circumvents democratic governance and treats development as individual charity, potentially degrading development discourse by ignoring systemic global injustices.","Four academic authors analyze the phenomenon of international voluntary work. Volunteer tourists commonly pay significant fees to engage in projects like building infrastructure, yet these funds could potentially procure more local labor if donated directly, particularly given the negligible technical expertise of gap-year participants. Thus, academic discourse often references the ethical dilemma of whether such volunteering stems from altruism or the pursuit of cultural capital for career enhancement. However, it may cultivate individuals who act ethically towards disadvantaged groups in their later lives. Volunteering can promote greater international comprehension, improved conflict-solving capabilities, and broader participation in global civil society, yielding synergistic benefits for both volunteers and host communities. Nevertheless, if predominantly accessible to privileged individuals from wealthy nations, it primarily augments their global perspectives and career prospects, with minimal impact on underserved populations, effectively utilizing host entities as stepping stones for personal growth. In negative manifestations, volunteering can embody imperialistic, paternalistic charity or self-serving endeavors; positively, it provides technical assistance and fosters cross-cultural exchanges that heighten awareness and commitment to addressing power imbalances and root causes of poverty. Volunteer tourism resonates with individualized altruistic strategies that eschew governmental and corporate structures, yet it undermines democratic representation and reduces development to charitable acts, reflecting a deterioration in development rhetoric by sidestepping structural inequalities.","Volunteer tourism

The politics of volunteer tourism represents a retreat from a social understanding of global inequalities and the poverty lived by so many in the developing word. ","Four academic commentators deliberate on international voluntary work, specifically volunteer tourism. Participants typically remit considerable fees for involvement in endeavors such as constructing dwellings or educational facilities; however, these monetary contributions, if channeled directly to indigenous communities, could ostensibly finance a superior quantum of labor relative to the individual's input, particularly given the dearth of technical proficiency or professional acumen among gap-year adherents. Ergo, it is unsurprising that scholarly investigations frequently allude to the moral quandary of whether such undertakings are principally driven by altruistic impulses or the accretion of cultural capital for vocational advancement. Notwithstanding, these initiatives may engender individuals who, throughout their professional and personal trajectories, espouse ethical conduct in favor of marginalized cohorts. Volunteering can precipitate enhanced international cognizance, refined conflict resolution aptitudes, and expansive democratic engagement in global affairs via civil society organizations, culminating in synergistic outcomes wherein aggregate benefits surpass the sum of individual contributions, accruing to both volunteers and host communities while advancing the global commonweal. Conversely, if volunteering is predominantly circumscribed to affluent denizens of prosperous regions, it may endow these privileged actors with an international outlook and career augmentation, yet it scarcely ameliorates the plight of those excluded from such opportunities, effectively conscripting host organizations and communities as instruments for personal ascension. In its most deleterious incarnations, international volunteering can manifest as imperialistic, paternalistic charity or a self-aggrandizing quest for professional and personal development among affluent Westerners; optimally, it constitutes the straightforward provision of technical assistance for development, concurrently facilitating the interchange of skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experiences within developing milieus, thereby fostering heightened awareness and an enduring dedication to contesting entrenched power disparities and the profound antecedents of poverty, inequity, and unsustainable development. Volunteer tourism appears congruent with the proliferation of life strategies oriented towards altruism, proffering a modest 'making a difference' that seems auspicious in an anti-political climate by circumventing governmental and corporate hegemony. Yet, it also evades the democratic imperatives of representative governance and reduces development to individuated acts of charity, often endeavoring to ameliorate rather than transmute the conditions of impoverished, rural societies. While cynicism towards volunteering is misguided, and the act itself may entail simple, laudable benevolence, the conflation of volunteer tourism with sustainable development by gap-year enterprises signifies a degradation of developmental discourse, emblematic of a retreat from a societal comprehension of global disparities and the pervasive indigence experienced in the developing world."

Transition. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless, that is, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process - because, frankly, it may not be a process at all. 
But surely (you say) it is bound to happen eventually. Everybody knows that print newspaper sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Just look at the latest print circulation figures. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and many of the rest are down overall between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites go ever higher. 
All of which may well be true, depending on timing, demography, geography and more. After all, everyone - from web academics to print analysts - says so. Yet pause for a while and count a few little things that don't quite fit.
So if sales in that area have fallen so little, perhaps the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, though, the messages are oddly mixed. The latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. 
As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to find in the eye of the digital storm - they had a 5.4% increase to report. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many showed rapid growth. 
You can discover a similar phenomenon when it comes to books. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up massively this year. The apparent first step of transition couldn't be clearer. 
Yet, when booksellers examined the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. 
Tales like these of young people abandoning newspaper-reading are wildly exaggerated. Turn to the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 following the main national dailies. 
And even within Europe, different countries have different stories to tell. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany the decline has only been 7% all round - with a mere 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). 
Such varying national trends may well reflect a situation far more complicated than the prophets of digital revolution assume. America's media analysts used to argue that booming online advertising revenues would pay for change and, along with lower production costs, make online newspapers a natural success. But now, with digital advertisements on newspaper sites actually dropping back, such assumptions seem like history. 
Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way of attracting a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package. 
In other words, print is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates raise between nine and ten times more money than online. 
Of course this huge difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex and expensive. But newspaper brands still have much of their high profile in print; adrift on the web, the job of just being noticed becomes far harder. ",C1,"The end of print newspapers may take a long time. This is by Peter Preston. Change can be scary for some people. But change can also be good. Newspapers are moving online. This is not easy. Many people think print sales are going down fast. But this is not always true. In some places, print sales are going up. For example, in Asia, sales are rising. Magazines are also doing well in some areas. Books are sold on screens and on paper. Young people still read newspapers. In Europe, different countries have different stories. In Britain, sales are down a lot. In Germany and France, sales are down a little. Online ads do not make much money. Print ads make more money. It is hard for newspapers to have both print and online. But print helps sell online subscriptions.","The end of print newspapers might take a long time, says Peter Preston. Change can be frightening, but transition means moving smoothly to the future. However, for newspapers going online, it is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe print sales are falling quickly while website visits rise. For instance, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have lower print sales, but their websites are more popular. Yet, global newspaper circulation increased by 1.1% last year, with growth in Asia balancing declines in the West. News magazines saw a 5.4% rise. E-books are booming, but physical book sales dropped only 0.4%. Young people are not abandoning newspapers; nearly 5 million aged 15-35 read national dailies. In Europe, Britain had a big drop in sales, but Germany and France had smaller declines. Online advertising revenues are falling, and print ads earn much more money. Newspapers use print to sell digital subscriptions, but managing both is expensive and difficult.","The decline of print newspapers may be slow, according to Peter Preston. Transition is generally a positive concept, implying steady progress, but for newspapers moving online, it is fraught with uncertainty. While it is widely accepted that print sales are decreasing and online traffic is increasing—for example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen annual declines of 8-10% in print but growth online—the reality is more complex. Globally, newspaper circulation actually rose by 1.1% last year, driven by gains in Asia that offset Western losses. News magazines experienced a 5.4% increase, and although e-reader sales are surging, physical book sales fell by only 0.4%. Contrary to myths, many young people still read newspapers, with nearly 5 million aged 15-35 engaging with national dailies. Trends vary by country: Britain saw significant drops, while Germany and France had modest declines. Assumptions about online advertising funding the transition have proven incorrect, as digital ad revenues are falling. Print remains crucial for selling digital subscriptions and generates substantially higher advertising income, though maintaining both formats is challenging for newspaper companies.","Peter Preston suggests that the demise of print newspapers could be a prolonged process. Transition typically conveys a sense of orderly change, yet for newspapers adapting to the digital realm, it is an uneasy and ambiguous journey. Although evidence indicates declining print circulations—such as The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian experiencing 8-10% yearly drops—coupled with rising online visits, the broader picture is nuanced. Global newspaper circulation increased by 1.1% last year, with Asian growth compensating for Western declines, and news magazines reported a 5.4% rise. E-readers like Kindle are flourishing, but physical book sales diminished by a mere 0.4%, indicating a coexistence of digital and print formats. Surveys refute claims that youth are deserting newspapers; approximately 5 million individuals aged 15-35 regularly read major national dailies. National disparities are evident: Britain faced sharp declines, whereas Germany and France saw more moderate reductions. Previous expectations that online advertising would finance the digital shift have been undermined by falling revenues, and print advertising continues to yield significantly higher returns. Consequently, print editions are instrumental in promoting digital subscriptions, despite the complexities and costs of sustaining both platforms.","The end of print may take some time

","Peter Preston posits that the cessation of print journalism may unfold gradually. Transition, ordinarily a reassuring term denoting seamless progression, assumes a disquieting and indeterminate character in the context of newspapers' migration to digital platforms. While it is incontrovertible that print circulations are diminishing—exemplified by The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian's annual declines of 8-10%—amid escalating online traffic, a more intricate reality prevails. Globally, newspaper circulation ascended by 1.1% last year, propelled by Asian advancements that counterbalanced Western regressions, and current affairs magazines witnessed a 5.4% augmentation. The proliferation of e-readers such as Kindle is pronounced, yet physical book sales experienced a negligible 0.4% contraction, underscoring a symbiotic relationship between digital and print mediums. Allegations of youth disengaging from newspapers are hyperbolic; nearly 5 million individuals aged 15-35 peruse principal national dailies, according to recent surveys. Heterogeneous national trajectories are conspicuous: Britain endured substantial decreases, in contrast to Germany and France's more attenuated downturns. Presumptions that burgeoning online advertising would underwrite the digital transformation have been invalidated by receding revenues, whereas print advertising persists in generating exponentially greater financial returns. Thus, print serves as a pivotal mechanism for cultivating digital subscriptions, notwithstanding the formidable exigencies of concurrently managing both print and online iterations."
245,"Sound the Alarm
Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio when we get up in the morning and most of us also require some external means to persuade us to get out of bed. Thus we have the clock radio. But how do you pick a good one? Our panel, which consisted of myself plus the inventor Tom Granger and the broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five currently available.
The 'dual alarm function' that is advertised with this model does not allow you, as I first supposed, to be woken by the buzzer, snooze a while and then finally be driven out of bed. The instruction booklet advises you to use this function to set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends, but whose life is programmed to this extent?
Since this model costs more or less the same as the second model tested, the inclusion of a cassette player is quite a bargain - you can fall asleep to your own soothing tapes and wake up to a day without news. We all thought the quality of the radio excellent, too - if only the whole thing was smaller. It's as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, 'Any clock radio I buy has to leave enough space on the bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses and telephone. Anyway, I'm completely paranoid and always book a wake-up call in case the alarm doesn't go off.'
This model was voted best in the beauty stakes and overall winner. Paul Bridges declared himself 'in love with it', although the clock on the one he tested 'kept getting stuck at 16.00'. I was fascinated by the digital display, with its classy grey numbers on a gentle green background. The wide snooze bar means you can tap it on the edge with your eyes shut. Unfortunately, the smooth undulations and tactile buttons, like pebbles on the beach, encouraged me to run my fingers over them as if they were keys on a piano, which proved my undoing when I finally looked at the SO-page instruction booklet.
The clock has a self-power back-up so you don't have to reset it if someone unceremoniously pulls the plug out in order to use a hairdryer or the vacuum cleaner; this met with unanimous approval. However, we all found it a technical feat to set up - though completing the learning curve made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.
Tom Granger described this model with its extra built- in lamp as 'unbelievably tacky' in the way it's made. 'You have to wrench the funny light out of its socket to get it to work, which makes me wonder about the quality of the rest of it.' He complained that he had to read the instruction booklet twice before he could get it to work; the clock kept leaping from 12.00 to 02.00 so he had to go round again.
The light was certainly hard to position; you would never be able to read by it - it only shines on the clock, which is illuminated anyway. Paul Bridges said he was 'very tickled' by the lamp idea but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer is reminiscent of 'action stations' on a submarine and made me feel like hurling the whole thing across the bedroom. Interestingly, however, this model is the third most popular on the market.
Clearly aimed at young people, with its brightly coloured casing and matching bootlace strap, this one appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. 'I would choose this one because it doesn't disappear into the background like the others,' he said. In fact, the traditional design of the controls made it the only one we managed to set up without reading the instruction booklet. Too bad the alarm is allowed a hilarious 20- minute margin for error; the manual notes, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the pre-set time'. Paul Bridges scoffed at such a notion, adding that this model was 'terribly fiddly' and, indeed, 'completely useless'.
The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested, this scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space', but also because it has old-fashioned dial tuning. 'It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning you're never really sure if you've pressed all the buttons in the right order so you can't have confidence that the thing will actually work.' He accepted, however, that manufacturers had been obliged to improve the quality of radios because of the advent of button-tuning. I thought the tuning rather crude, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model certainly works; it succeeded in getting me out of bed in just two beeps!

","A multitude of individuals initiate their diurnal routines by tuning into the radio, necessitating external apparatuses such as clock radios to rouse themselves from slumber. An assemblage of specialists, including the author, an inventor, and a broadcaster, subjected five extant models to rigorous scrutiny. One model purports to offer a dual alarm functionality, ostensibly for demarcating divergent awakening periods, yet its substantial dimensions render it cumbersome. Another model, replete with an integrated cassette player, affords users the capacity to succumb to somnolence accompanied by personalized audio, concurrently delivering impeccable radio fidelity. The preeminent model, lauded for its visual elegance and comprehensive excellence, features a digital interface with an expansive snooze mechanism; however, its intricate setup process, albeit mitigated by an autonomous power reserve, posed challenges. A subsequent model, incorporating an ill-positioned luminaire and an alarm evocative of naval action stations, paradoxically enjoys considerable commercial success. Another model, distinguished by its chromatic vibrancy, facilitates intuitive operation without recourse to manuals, notwithstanding its alarm's propensity for temporal inaccuracy. The most rudimentary model, characterized by its frugality and compactness, employs analog dial tuning and an efficacious buzzer, eliciting commendation for its reliability."
246,"Margaret and her liquid assets
Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense'. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up.
Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business, using technology such as drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But when it comes to locating water, she needs nothing more than a forked hazel stick. The couple's success rate is higher than 90 per cent. Dowsing - the ability to locate water, minerals and lost objects underground - is a so-called 'sixth sense'. There are many theories about how it is done, ranging from the physical, such as magnetism, to the spiritual. One of the most credible is based on the knowledge that everything on this planet vibrates, water more than other matter. It is suggested that dowsers have an acute ability to sense vibrations while standing on the Earth's surface; some dowsers say that they can 'sense' water, others that they can smell it, smell being the most acute sense.
For the Wilkins, the drought years of recent times have been busy, with an almost six-week-long waiting list at one stage. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with wells that have dried up: 'We will see customers only once in a lifetime because wells last for a long time.' Other customers own remote cottages or barns, now holiday homes, where the expense of running water pipes for great distances is prohibitive. Others are golf-course developers with clubhouse facilities to build.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 metres down. 'You can't drill a well where there is the slightest risk of farm or other waste getting into the water supply. The water we locate is running in fissures of impervious rock and, as long as we bring the water straight up, it should give a good clean supply, though Cornwall is rich in minerals so you have to watch out for iron.'
Another necessity is electricity to drive the pump; this is too expensive to run across miles of fields so ideally the well should be near to existing power supplies.
After considering all this, Margaret can start to look for water. On large areas, such as golf courses, she begins with a map of the area and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and gently move it over the map. It will swing when it is suspended over an area where there is water.'
After the map has indicated likely areas, Margaret walks over the fields with a hazel stick, forked and equal in length and width each side. 'Once I'm above water I get a peculiar feeling; I reel slightly. When it subsides I use the stick to locate the exact spot where we should drill.' Gripping the two forks of the stick with both hands, she eases them outwards slightly to give tension. 'When water is immediately below, the straight part of the stick rises up. It's vital to drill exactly where the stick says. A fraction the wrong way, and you can miss the waterline altogether. My husband will dowse the same area as me; usually, not always, we agree on the precise place to drill. If we disagree, we won't drill and will keep looking until we do agree.'
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation, carrying out some curious old tradition down in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment' and that is the closest we can get to understanding why she locates water so accurately. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?
",C1,Margaret Wilkins can find water with a stick. She has a special sense. She works with her husband. They drill wells for water. Many farmers need her help because their wells are dry.

Their success rate is over 90%. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells dry up. She also helps people with holiday homes and golf courses. Margaret uses a map and a pendulum first, then walks with the stick to find the exact drilling spot. She and her husband always agree before drilling. This skill helps their business succeed.","Margaret Wilkins possesses a 'sixth sense' that enables her to locate water using a forked hazel rod. She and her husband operate a well-drilling business, employing technology like drilling rigs, but rely on dowsing for water detection. Their success rate exceeds 90%. Dowsing involves sensing underground water, with theories suggesting it detects vibrations. Due to recent droughts, demand for their services is high, primarily from farmers with dry wells, as well as owners of remote properties and golf-course developers. Margaret ensures water is found in deep, clean rock fissures and considers factors like avoiding contamination and proximity to electricity. She uses a pendulum over maps and a hazel stick in the field to pinpoint drilling locations, requiring agreement with her husband before proceeding. This intuitive ability is key to their enduring business success.","Margaret Wilkins is renowned for her 'sixth sense' in dowsing, utilizing a forked hazel stick to detect subterranean water. In partnership with her husband, she manages a well-drilling enterprise that integrates advanced machinery with traditional dowsing techniques, achieving a success rate above 90%. Dowsing, the practice of locating water, minerals, or lost objects underground, is theorized to operate through physical mechanisms like vibration detection or spiritual means. High demand during drought periods has led to extensive waiting lists, with clients including farmers experiencing well failures, owners of isolated holiday homes, and golf-course developers. Margaret targets water depths of 50-70 metres in impervious rock to ensure purity, mindful of mineral content like iron, and prioritizes sites near existing power supplies for pump operation. Her methodology involves preliminary map analysis with a pendulum, followed by field dowsing with a hazel stick to identify precise drilling points, with consensus from her husband being essential. Anthropologists have studied this intuitive perception, which Margaret describes as an acute environmental awareness, underpinning the family's sustained livelihood from their business.","Margaret and her liquid assets

","Margaret Wilkins is attributed with a 'sixth sense,' manifesting in her capacity to employ a forked hazel rod for hydro-detection, a skill increasingly solicited by agriculturists confronting desiccated wells. In concert with her spouse, she oversees a well-drilling venture that amalgamates technological apparatus such as drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers with the arcane art of dowsing, boasting a success rate surpassing 90%. Dowsing, defined as the faculty to discern aqueous, mineral, or obscured subterranean entities, is postulated to function via diverse mechanisms, ranging from physical phenomena like magnetism to esoteric explanations; one plausible theory posits that dowsers exhibit a heightened sensitivity to terrestrial vibrations, with some practitioners alleging olfactory or sensory perceptions. The protracted droughts of recent epochs have engendered a burgeoning clientele, encompassing agrarian proprietors with depleted wells—typically one-time patrons due to the longevity of well infrastructure—as well as holders of remote cottages or barns converted into holiday retreats, where extensive piped water installations are economically unfeasible, and golf-course developers erecting clubhouse amenities. Margaret endeavors to pinpoint aqueous reservoirs at depths of 50 to 70 metres within fissures of impermeable rock, thereby obviating contamination risks from agrarian effluents and ensuring a potable supply, albeit with vigilance for mineral impurities such as iron endemic to Cornwall. Prerequisites include proximate electrical sources to power pumps, circumventing exorbitant transmission costs across vast terrains. Her modus operandi entails initial cartographic scrutiny using a pendulum to identify promising zones, succeeded by terrestrial traversal with a symmetrically forked hazel stick; upon encountering aqueous signals, she experiences a distinctive sensation and employs the stick's ascent to demarcate the exact drilling locus, with spousal concordance being imperative to avoid missing the waterline. This enigmatic intuition, which Margaret characterizes as an 'intuitive perception of the environment,' has captivated anthropological and literary circles, and it constitutes the linchpin of the family's perennial commercial viability."
247,"I may be too old for this lark, but here goes!
At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He ponders what has made him -- and others of hi sage -- take the plunge.
This summer, I quit my job and resolved to rent out my flat and go travelling in South East Asia for a yeaL You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous.
It's not as if I haven't done the travelling thing before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned. was determined to do it again some day, But you know how it is ... I fell in love, embarked on a career, bought a Hat and got used to earning a salary. But I gradually realised I had been sacrificing my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in that letter of resignation, it felt as though I'd taken charge of my life again.
I now have no tics. Many of my friends are now married with children and, while they wouldn't swap places with me, they envy me my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no burning career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake!
Why am I so nervous? In the first place, 1t's a question of making the necessary arrangements. How could I bear to have someone else living in my home? And how would I go about organising the letting? And apart from anything else, I had to decide where to go.
T'm a shocking procrastinator. and am already several weeks behind my intended schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not hang around for the start of the football season?' Severing emotional ties makes it even more difficult.
I'm putting it off because, deep down, I wonder if I can still cope with backpacking. Will I be able to readjust to a more basic wav of life? Will I feel out of place among a community of backpackers fresh out of school and university?
Perhaps not. I've discovered it's increasingly common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to disentangle themselves from the lives they've made for themselves and head ofT for foreign climes.
Jennifer Cox, of Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, identifies a growing awareness that adventure is there for the raking: 'The penny's dropped. The sort of people who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity"" are realising that they can have it any time they want. They just have to be brave enough and organised enough and confident enough to do it.'
1-'0I' Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have a final fling before settling down. They have bought 'I round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm prepared to sacrifice job security to have the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a niggling thought at the back of your mind that. ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'm going to be in the same position I was in before when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take, When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a ceremonial act of defiance!'
For Matt, who'd just got out of the Army, the year he spent travelling amounted to a period of metamorphosis. 'When you're in the military, there's a set wav of doing things, a pattern to the way you approach problems. I went away because I really needed to temper this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, in order to have a reasonable existence as a civilian.'
While there are as many reasons to go travelling at my time of life as there are travellers, there do seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts and so if your contract's just come to an end you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.'
For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specialises in the tales of 'ordinary' travellers, an increasing number of thirty-somethings are taking stock of their lives. 'If you're nor happy doing what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer a question of just seeing it through. Now people are aware that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" any more. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to take a step back and think about your life.'
Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to come to terms with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks nor. 'It's a sign of a better educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paving the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?""
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading off to Central America for a year , does nor believe he's running away. 'It's more a case of running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself' But he does feel some trepidation. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day. saying ""hi"" to everyone and sitting down with a cup of coffee.'
I share Ben's reservations about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges and I'm nor sure I'd be making this journey if [ hadn't found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst. like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.'
It may have taken a helpful kick up the backside to get me moving, but I'm now approaching the next 12 months with a mounting sense of excitement. Whatever the outcome, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having grabbed life by the horns. And in that I'm sure I speak for all of us ageing backpackers.

Dan Hiscocks notes that travel allows people to reassess their lives. Jennifer Cox argues this reflects a societal shift towards valuing balanced lives over mere bill-paying.

Tim's decision was catalyzed by an intolerable boss, and he now looks forward to the journey with excitement.","Tim Pozzi, aged 34, has resigned from his job to embark on a year-long backpacking journey across South East Asia, though he experiences nervousness about this decision. He reflects on his past travels in the Americas after university and his subsequent life choices, including falling in love, pursuing a career, and acquiring a flat, which led him to feel he was compromising his self-worth for financial stability. Currently unattached and without pressing career aspirations, he perceives an obligation to utilise his freedom, a sentiment envied by his married friends with children. Tim's anxieties encompass practicalities like organising the rental of his flat and selecting destinations, compounded by his tendency to procrastinate and emotional ties that make departure difficult. He questions his ability to readjust to a basic lifestyle and integrate with younger backpackers. This phenomenon is increasingly common among Britons in their late twenties and thirties. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet identifies a growing awareness that adventure is attainable for those with courage and organisation, as seen in Danny and Tammy, who are taking a pre-settlement year off, with Danny performing a symbolic act of defiance by discarding his calculator. Matt utilised travel for personal transformation after military service. Angela Baron highlights the flexibility in modern employment, such as short-term contracts and career-break policies, facilitating such excursions. Dan Hiscocks suggests that travel provides an opportunity for life reassessment in an era where jobs are no longer perceived as permanent. Jennifer Cox contends this trend indicates a societal evolution towards prioritising balanced living over mere subsistence. Ben, departing for Central America, shares reservations about abandoning his routine, while Tim acknowledges that an intolerable boss acted as a catalyst for his journey, now filling him with mounting excitement for the forthcoming adventure.","I may be too old for this lark, but here goes!
At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He ponders what has made him -- and others of hi sage -- take the plunge.
This summer, I quit my job and resolved to rent out my flat and go travelling in South East Asia for a yeaL You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous.
It's not as if I haven't done the travelling thing before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned. was determined to do it again some day, But you know how it is ... I fell in love, embarked on a career, bought a Hat and got used to earning a salary. But I gradually realised I had been sacrificing my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in that letter of resignation, it felt as though I'd taken charge of my life again.
I now have no tics. Many of my friends are now married with children and, while they wouldn't swap places with me, they envy me my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no burning career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake!
Why am I so nervous? In the first place, 1t's a question of making the necessary arrangements. How could I bear to have someone else living in my home? And how would I go about organising the letting? And apart from anything else, I had to decide where to go.
T'm a shocking procrastinator. and am already several weeks behind my intended schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not hang around for the start of the football season?' Severing emotional ties makes it even more difficult.
I'm putting it off because, deep down, I wonder if I can still cope with backpacking. Will I be able to readjust to a more basic wav of life? Will I feel out of place among a community of backpackers fresh out of school and university?
Perhaps not. I've discovered it's increasingly common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to disentangle themselves from the lives they've made for themselves and head ofT for foreign climes.
Jennifer Cox, of Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, identifies a growing awareness that adventure is there for the raking: 'The penny's dropped. The sort of people who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity"" are realising that they can have it any time they want. They just have to be brave enough and organised enough and confident enough to do it.'
1-'0I' Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have a final fling before settling down. They have bought 'I round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm prepared to sacrifice job security to have the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a niggling thought at the back of your mind that. ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'm going to be in the same position I was in before when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take, When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a ceremonial act of defiance!'
For Matt, who'd just got out of the Army, the year he spent travelling amounted to a period of metamorphosis. 'When you're in the military, there's a set wav of doing things, a pattern to the way you approach problems. I went away because I really needed to temper this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, in order to have a reasonable existence as a civilian.'
While there are as many reasons to go travelling at my time of life as there are travellers, there do seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts and so if your contract's just come to an end you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.'
For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specialises in the tales of 'ordinary' travellers, an increasing number of thirty-somethings are taking stock of their lives. 'If you're nor happy doing what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer a question of just seeing it through. Now people are aware that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" any more. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to take a step back and think about your life.'
Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to come to terms with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks nor. 'It's a sign of a better educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paving the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?""
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading off to Central America for a year , does nor believe he's running away. 'It's more a case of running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself' But he does feel some trepidation. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day. saying ""hi"" to everyone and sitting down with a cup of coffee.'
I share Ben's reservations about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges and I'm nor sure I'd be making this journey if [ hadn't found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst. like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.'
It may have taken a helpful kick up the backside to get me moving, but I'm now approaching the next 12 months with a mounting sense of excitement. Whatever the outcome, I'll be able to take satisfaction in having grabbed life by the horns. And in that I'm sure I speak for all of us ageing backpackers.
","At 34, Tim Pozzi has forsaken a stable career to undertake a year of backpacking across South East Asia, albeit with a sense of trepidation. He contemplates the impetus behind his and his contemporaries' decisions to embark on such ventures. Having previously traversed North and South America post-university, he harboured a latent desire to resume travelling, yet was ensnared by romantic entanglements, professional advancement, and home ownership, gradually realising he had subordinated his intrinsic worth to monetary gain. His resignation thus represented a reclamation of autonomy. Presently unencumbered by employment, romantic commitments, or fervent career ambitions, he feels almost duty-bound to capitalise on this liberty, particularly as his peers, now settled with families, express envy over his lack of responsibilities. Apprehensions arise from logistical complexities, such as leasing his residence and determining itineraries, exacerbated by his proclivity for procrastination and the emotional difficulty of severing ties. He harbours doubts about his capacity to adapt to a rudimentary existence and assimilate amidst a cohort of youthful backpackers. This inclination is not anomalous; a burgeoning number of individuals in their late twenties and thirties are seeking to extricate themselves from established lives. Jennifer Cox of Lonely Planet discerns an emergent cognisance that adventure is readily accessible, necessitating only bravery, organisation, and confidence. Illustratively, Danny, an accountant, and his partner Tammy are seizing a final escapade before domesticity, with Danny ritually discarding his calculator as an act of defiance. Matt employed travel as a crucible for metamorphosis after military service, aiming to shed regimented problem-solving approaches. Angela Baron attributes this trend to a more pliable labour market, replete with transient contracts and institutionalised career breaks, thereby mitigating risks. Dan Hiscocks posits that travel affords a vantage for existential reassessment in an epoch where occupational permanence is obsolete. Jennifer Cox refutes the notion of generational immaturity, instead interpreting it as indicative of a sophisticated society prioritising holistic fulfilment over pecuniary concerns. Ben, en route to Central America, concedes to unease about relinquishing quotidian comforts, while Tim acknowledges that an insufferable superior served as the catalyst for his odyssey, now imbuing him with escalating anticipation for the impending sojourn."
250,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas...

It is strange how many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Out of the blue, Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden, has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today.
His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers of the baroque and classical periods, but new works too. When you meet him, bright-eyed and good-looking, he seems even younger than his years, as fresh and open in his manner as the sound of the trumpet.
Recently in one of London's premier concert halls he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, something of a party-piece for him, while on television a whole feature was devoted to his work and development, filmed both here and in Sweden.
Born near Malmo, he owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight.
His father, unmusical but liking Louis Armstrong's playing, had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. Being a serious man, he didn't pick a toy trumpet, but took advice and bought a genuine grown-up instrument.
The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, whom she persuaded to give her son lessons.
Bo Nilsson was an up-and-coming musician, and at once spotted natural talent. Hardenberger consistently blesses his luck to have got such a teacher right from the start, one who was himself so obsessed with the trumpet and trumpet-playing that he would search out and contact players all over the world, and as a 'trumpet fanatic' was 'always looking for another mouthpiece'.
There the mature Hardenberger has to draw a line between himself and his teacher. 'The trumpet is so primitive an instrument,' he explains, 'that you can't build a trumpet that is acoustically perfect. Whatever you do, it will have imperfections. Besides, you can't find two mouthpieces exactly the same. To me it is a matter of getting to know the imperfections and making a relationship with them.'
From the very start Hardenberger seems to have had the gift of finding the right compromise, and making that relationship. Without any sense of boasting, he explains that even in his boyhood years the characteristic Hardenberger sound was already recognisable, 'the first thing I acquired'.
And unlike the great British contender among virtuoso trumpet-players, John Wallace, who developed originally from a brass-band background and then through working in orchestras, Hardenberger has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple.
From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, another player who bypassed the orchestra. The boy bought all his records, and idolised him.
His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career. It was then a question of where, at 15, he should be sent to study. America, Bo Nilsson's first choice, was thought to be too far away and too dangerous, which meant that he went instead at the age of 16 to study in Paris with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud confirmed his prejudice against going into an orchestra, saying that 'Playing in the orchestra is like digging in the garden.'
He was objective enough about himself to know that he played the trumpet better than others of his age, but it was only at the end of the first competition he entered, at the age of 17 during his first year in Paris, that he came to realise that in addition he had a particular gift of communicating.
Thibaud suggested that he should enter the competition just for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round only, but he won through to the second. Luckily he already knew most of the pieces in that round too, but on getting through to the final he was faced with a concerto that had already daunted him. He didn't win first prize that time, but he enjoyed the performance, realising that though he 'played like a pig', people did listen to him.
Quoted like that, Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. Thoughtfully he refuses to try and analyse what such a gift of communication might consist of, as 'You risk destroying it in trying to explain. The power of the music lies in the fact that it can always move people.'",C1,"A trumpet is not only for Christmas. Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player from Sweden.

Hardenberger has since become renowned for expanding the trumpet repertoire with both historical and contemporary works. He believes the trumpet is acoustically imperfect, but he has learned to adapt to its flaws. From childhood, he aspired to be a soloist, inspired by French trumpeter Maurice Andre. He studied in Paris with Pierre Thibaud, who discouraged orchestral work. At 17, Hardenberger entered a competition and discovered his gift for communicating with audiences through music.

Hakan Hardenberger, a preeminent trumpeter originating from a musically barren environment in southern Sweden, has, by age 30, carved a singular niche in the global trumpet milieu. His genesis traces to a fortuitous Christmas gift at eight years old: his father, devoid of musicality yet enamored with Louis Armstrong, procured an authentic instrument upon counsel. This instigated an unceasing devotion, with his mother engaging Bo Nilsson, a burgeoning musician from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, who instantly discerned prodigious talent. Hardenberger's discography perpetually enlarges the repertory, encompassing overlooked baroque and classical concerti alongside avant-garde works. He posits that the trumpet, being acoustically flawed and primitive, necessitates an intimate acquaintance with its imperfections. Eschewing orchestral immersion from youth, he modeled himself after Maurice Andre, pursuing a pristine solo career. Under Pierre Thibaud's tutelage in Paris, his aversion to orchestral endeavors was reinforced by Thibaud's analogy to horticultural toil. At 17, a competition unveiled his distinctive communicative prowess; though he performed inadequately, he captivated audiences, leading him to eschew introspection into this faculty, lest explicating it undermine music's intrinsic capacity to evoke profound responses."

253,"The Cabinet-Maker
Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him
Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop, tucked under a railway arch in East London, and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well, fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. But a glance around the workshop reveals that Hurst is obviously busy, with good reason not to waste a minute of his time.
The arched space is full of half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in an amazing array of natural colours. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built up a very nice reputation for himself. His order book is always full for several months in advance, despite the fact that he does not really promote himself. Word has spread that if you want a decent cupboard or table, bookcase or kitchen units, Hurst is your man.
Of course, finding a furniture-maker is not that taxing a task. Wherever you live in the countryside, the craft is alive and well. But finding a cabinet- maker who prides himself on making beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines is less easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says wearily. As a craftsman who sets himself exacting standards, he is continually disappointed by some contemporary furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He rails against shoddy, mass-produced furniture, and craftsmen who churn out second-rate pieces.
Such a quest for perfection is obviously a key to Hurst's success. That and his talent. This man is not coy about his ability. Indeed, his blatant self- confidence is as surprising as his initial brusque manner. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says, with a deadpan expression. 'I have always been good at making things.' If it were not for the self-deprecating mood into which he slipped towards the end of our interview, I would have believed his conceit to be wholly genuine.
Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says nonchalantly. Almost all of his commissions come from private individuals ('l used to do some commercial work for companies but it was soul-destroying'). Some clients have returned time and again. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he is honest enough to admit that relationships with clients do not always run smoothly. 'The most infuriating clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favourite clients are the exacting ones.'
If Hurst has every reason to be pleased with himself, he is also gracious in his praise for others - where it is due. With a sudden shot of modesty, he says: 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (the leading college of furniture design). However, he is also unremittingly critical of those craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also has little time for degree shows, in which students exhibit their work but at the same time are 'trying to make fashion statements. That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.'
Confident Hurst may be, even brusque, but you could never call him or his work pretentious. Indeed, his parting shot displays a welcome down- to-earth approach to his craft and a streak of humility strangely at odds with his earlier self- confidence. 'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says as I make my exit.",C1,"Charles Hurst makes furniture. He works in a workshop under a train bridge in East London. He is very busy. His workshop has many pieces of wood and furniture that are not finished. He has been making furniture for ten years. Many people want his furniture. He does not advertise. People tell others about his good work. It is easy to find furniture makers in the countryside. But it is hard to find makers who make very good furniture. Charles says there are not many real cabinet-makers now. He does not like bad, mass-made furniture. He wants everything to be perfect. He is very good at his job and knows it. He learned by himself. He asks questions to learn. Most of his work is for people in their homes. Some clients come back many times. Sometimes clients are difficult. They do not know what they want. Charles likes clients who know what they want. He says some people are better than him. He can admire them. But he does not like craftsmen who take too long to make one piece. He thinks furniture should be useful, not just for show. Charles is confident but not proud. He says he is only making furniture.","Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates well-made furniture. His workshop is located under a railway arch in East London. When I visited, he seemed in a hurry and gave a quick handshake. The workshop is full of unfinished furniture and wood in many natural colors. Charles has worked as a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a strong reputation. His order book is always full for months ahead, even though he does not promote himself. Word of mouth brings him customers who want cupboards, tables, bookcases, or kitchen units. It is not hard to find furniture makers in rural areas, but finding one who makes simple, beautiful furniture is more difficult. Charles says there are few true cabinet-makers now; many just call themselves furniture-makers. He is disappointed by some modern furniture and criticizes poor quality, mass-produced items. His success comes from his high standards and talent. He is very confident in his abilities and says he has a natural skill for making things. Charles taught himself by asking questions. Most of his work is for private clients, as he found commercial work unsatisfying. Some clients return repeatedly, which he finds rewarding. However, some clients are frustrating when they change their minds too late. Charles admires other skilled craftsmen but is critical of those who take too long or make furniture for fashion rather than use. Despite his confidence, he is humble and says he is only making furniture.","Charles Hurst earns his living as a cabinet-maker, producing expertly crafted furniture. I met him at his workshop beneath a railway arch in East London, where he appeared hurried, greeting me with a brisk handshake. It was unclear if this brusqueness was genuine or a cover for shyness, but the busy workshop showed he had little time to spare. The space was filled with partially completed furniture and wood planks in a variety of natural hues. With ten years of experience, Hurst has built a solid reputation, and his order book is consistently full for months in advance without any self-promotion. People recommend him for quality items like cupboards, tables, bookcases, or kitchen units. While furniture makers are common in the countryside, it is harder to find one who focuses on clean, simple designs. Hurst notes that true cabinet-makers are rare today and expresses weariness over some contemporary furniture, criticizing shoddy, mass-produced goods. His dedication to perfection and innate talent are key to his success. He openly acknowledges his ability, stating he has a natural gift for making things, though he later showed some modesty. Self-taught, he learned by asking questions and now mainly works for private individuals, having found commercial work unfulfilling. Repeat clients are satisfying, but he admits that relationships can be strained, especially with indecisive clients. Hurst praises other skilled craftsmen but is unyielding in his criticism of those who prioritize art over utility or take excessive time. Ultimately, he maintains a practical, humble view, emphasizing that furniture should be functional.","Charles Hurst sustains his livelihood through the creation of impeccably crafted furniture. During my visit to his workshop, situated under a railway arch in East London, he conveyed an impression of haste with a swift handshake and an invitation to begin immediately. Whether this brusque demeanor was authentic or a facade for shyness remained ambiguous, but the cluttered workshop, brimming with unfinished furniture and an array of naturally colored wood planks, attested to his busy schedule. Having practiced cabinet-making for a decade, Hurst has cultivated an excellent reputation, resulting in an order book perpetually filled for months ahead, despite his lack of self-promotion. Recommendations ensure a steady stream of clients seeking quality cupboards, tables, bookcases, or kitchen units. Although locating a furniture-maker is generally straightforward in rural settings, identifying one who prides themselves on elegantly simple designs is more challenging. Hurst laments the scarcity of genuine cabinet-makers today, expressing disillusionment with much contemporary furniture and condemning inferior, mass-produced items. His success is rooted in an unwavering pursuit of perfection and his evident talent; he displays unabashed self-confidence, claiming a natural aptitude for craftsmanship, though he later revealed a self-deprecating side. Entirely self-taught, he acquired his skills through inquiry and now primarily accepts commissions from private individuals, having abandoned commercial work he found soul-destroying. While he derives satisfaction from repeat clients who engage him for entire homes, he candidly acknowledges that client relationships can be fraught, particularly with those who are indecisive. Hurst is gracious in acknowledging superior craftsmen but remains critical of those who prioritize artistic statements over practicality or prolong production unnecessarily. In conclusion, despite his confidence, he exhibits a grounded humility, asserting that he is merely producing functional furniture.","The Cabinet-Maker
Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him
Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop, tucked under a railway arch in East London, and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well, fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. But a glance around the workshop reveals that Hurst is obviously busy, with good reason not to waste a minute of his time.
The arched space is full of half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in an amazing array of natural colours. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built up a very nice reputation for himself. His order book is always full for several months in advance, despite the fact that he does not really promote himself. Word has spread that if you want a decent cupboard or table, bookcase or kitchen units, Hurst is your man.
Of course, finding a furniture-maker is not that taxing a task. Wherever you live in the countryside, the craft is alive and well. But finding a cabinet- maker who prides himself on making beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines is less easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says wearily. As a craftsman who sets himself exacting standards, he is continually disappointed by some contemporary furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He rails against shoddy, mass-produced furniture, and craftsmen who churn out second-rate pieces.
Such a quest for perfection is obviously a key to Hurst's success. That and his talent. This man is not coy about his ability. Indeed, his blatant self- confidence is as surprising as his initial brusque manner. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says, with a deadpan expression. 'I have always been good at making things.'

'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says as I make my exit.","Charles Hurst derives his income from the meticulous fabrication of furniture, and in an encounter at his workshop nestled beneath a railway arch in East London, he projected an aura of urgency, proffering a perfunctory handshake and exhorting me to commence without delay. The veracity of this brusqueness—whether intrinsic or a veneer concealing diffidence—was not immediately discernible, yet a survey of the workshop, replete with nascent furniture pieces and timber in a stunning spectrum of natural hues, unequivocally indicated his incessant occupation. A decade into his vocation as a cabinet-maker, Hurst has assiduously forged a distinguished reputation, his order ledger perennially replete for months in advance, notwithstanding his eschewal of self-promotion. His renown propagates through word-of-mouth, with patrons seeking superlative cupboards, tables, bookcases, or kitchen units. While procuring a furniture-maker is scarcely an arduous undertaking in pastoral locales, securing one who exults in producing exquisitely crafted pieces with austere, elegant lines is markedly more elusive. Hurst articulates a wearisome observation that authentic cabinet-makers are now few, as he censures substandard, mass-manufactured furniture and artisans who proliferate mediocre wares. His unyielding quest for perfection, coupled with his prodigious talent, underpins his prosperity; he exhibits palpable self-assurance, professing an innate prowess in fabrication, though this ostensibly unadulterated conceit was later mitigated by a self-effacing inclination. Autodidactic in his craft, he assimilated expertise through astute inquiry and now predominantly undertakes commissions from private clientele, having renounced commercial endeavors he deemed spiritually enervating. While he finds profound gratification in recurrent patrons who entrust him with entire domiciles, he forthrightly concedes that client interactions are not invariably harmonious, particularly with those plagued by indecision. Hurst bestows commendation upon superior craftsmen where merited but remains inexorably critical of those who conflate craftsmanship with artistry or engage in protracted, pretentious endeavors. Ultimately, his parting reflection evinced a salutary pragmatism and an incongruous humility, underscoring that his vocation is fundamentally about crafting utilitarian furniture."
254,"Dorothy who?
The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel prize should be a household name in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is little known
For the past four years, I have been subjecting friends and acquaintances to the Dorothy Hodgkin test. It's very simple: when asked what I am working on, I tell them I am writing the first biography of Dorothy Hodgkin. If their eyes light up, and they say things like 'Surely there's one already!' they have passed.
Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to have won a Nobel prize ought to be enough. Anyone who held the same distinction in literature would be a household name. But Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was a remarkable individual by any standards, as many-faceted as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects some of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century: among them, the advancement of women's education and the globalisation of science.
When I began my research, I set out to read some scientific biographies. One of Hodgkin's friends recommended a new biography of Linus Pauling. Pauling was a close friend and contemporary of Hodgkin, worked in the same branch of science and shared a commitment to campaigning against nuclear weapons. I hurried to the main bookshop in the university town where I live, only to discover that not a single biography of Pauling was on the shelves. I now realise I was naive to be surprised that Pauling was not deemed sufficiently interesting to British readers, even though he was the most influential chemist of the 20th century and a winner of Nobel prizes for both chemistry and peace.
Even scientists themselves have doubted the value of the scientific biography. 'The lives of scientists, considered as Lives, almost always make dull reading', wrote the late Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, who laid most of the scientific groundwork that now makes organ transplants possible.
If scientists propagate this negative view, it is hardly surprising if publishers and booksellers share it. Treating scientists differently from everybody else as biographical subjects is one of the outstanding symptoms of the 'two cultures' mentality, the belief that there is an unbridgeable divide of understanding between the arts and sciences, still prevalent in the literary world. Few but the towering giants of science make it into the biography sections of bookshops.
Of course it is nonsense to say scientists, as a group, lead less interesting lives than artists and writers, or actors, or politicians. For some, the fastidiousness involved in maintaining scientific credibility extends to any kind of media appearance. A leading geneticist once told me he was happy to be interviewed about his work, but did not want to be quoted directly or photographed, because he did not want to be perceived as 'self-promoting'.
The avoidance of the personal conveys a false impression of the enterprise of science that discourages young people from joining in, and fosters more public suspicion than it dispels.
Fortunately, gaps are appearing in the smokescreen. Contemporary scientists now regularly appear in the public eye in contexts other than the straightforward scientific interview. For instance, Professor Richard Dawkins presents prizes to winners of a TV quiz, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on television. No doubt these activities have raised eyebrows in laboratories but they have done more to make scientists recognisable as people than any number of academic papers.
The publishing world is also undergoing a transformation. Scientific biographies and autobiographies, if they appeared at all, used to be rather scholarly but dull and over- reverent. The life which the scientist in question led outside work marriage, children, things most people regard as fairly central to their existence - was often dismissed in a couple of paragraphs. That changed with Richard Feynman's Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?, the hilarious and affecting memoir of a man who also happened to be one of the century's greatest theoretical physicists.
More recently, even the greatest names in science, such as Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Marie Curie have been allowed to appear with all their flaws clearly visible. To the reader, it does not matter that Einstein's relationship with his family is 'irrelevant' to his General Theory of Relativity. The question of how creative genius copes with emotional ups and downs, trivial practicalities, the social demands of ordinary life, is absorbing in its own right.
Dorothy Hodgkin was devoted to her scientific work. Her most important successes were solving the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1964, and of insulin, which her group solved in 1969. In each case she pushed the technique into realms of complexity others deemed unreachable at the time.
But she also had three children to whom she was devoted and was married to a frequently absent husband with a career as a historian. Her personal life is not strictly relevant to her work as a scientist, but surely we can all learn from her capacity to unite the disparate threads of her life into a coherent whole. There is much in her life of universal interest, but it would be disloyal of me to imply that this does not include the science itself. Scientific inquiry was the passion of Hodgkin's life, as it has to be for any successful scientist.
How to communicate the nature of this passion is the hardest task for the scientific biographer. Most readers are not equipped with enough fundamental scientific concepts to grasp more complex ideas without a lot of explanation. Understanding scientific ideas is not really any more difficult than reading Shakespeare or learning a foreign language - it just takes application. It is sad to think that educated people, who would be embarrassed if they fail to recognise the name of some distinguished literary or artistic figure, continue to live in happy ignorance of the rich heritage represented by scientists such as Dorothy Hodgkin.
",C1,Dorothy Hodgkin was a British woman scientist. She won the Nobel Prize. She is the only British woman to win this prize. But not many people in Britain know her. The writer is making a book about her life. Dorothy Hodgkin studied crystals. She found out how penicillin and vitamin B12 are made. She had three children and a husband who was often away. Scientists' lives can be interesting. More people should know about scientists like her.,"Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. However, she is not well-known in Britain. The writer is working on her first biography. When the writer tells people about this, some do not know who Dorothy is. Dorothy was a remarkable person. She studied crystals and solved the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin. She had a family with three children and a husband who traveled a lot. Scientists often avoid personal fame, which makes them less known. But learning about scientists' lives can be interesting and important for everyone.","Dorothy Hodgkin was the only British woman scientist to receive a Nobel Prize, yet she remains little known in her own country. The author is writing her first biography and uses a simple test: when mentioning Dorothy Hodgkin, if people recognize her, they pass. Dorothy was an exceptional individual who studied crystals and determined the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, earning her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. Her life reflects major 20th-century changes, such as advances in women's education. She balanced her scientific career with a personal life, including three children and a frequently absent husband. Unfortunately, scientific biographies are often overlooked due to a belief that scientists' lives are dull, but this is untrue and discourages public interest in science.","Dorothy Hodgkin, the sole British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, should be a household name in Britain, but she is largely unrecognized. The author, who is composing her first biography, notes that many people are unfamiliar with Hodgkin upon mention. Hodgkin was a multifaceted individual whose work in crystallography led to groundbreaking discoveries, such as elucidating the structures of penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin, for which she received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. Her life encapsulated significant 20th-century developments, including the progress in women's education and the globalization of science. She managed a devoted family life with three children and a husband often away due to his career. The reluctance to publicize scientists' personal lives, stemming from a 'two cultures' divide between arts and sciences, often results in scientific biographies being neglected, though they can reveal the passion and humanity behind scientific achievements.","Dorothy who?

","Dorothy Hodgkin, the only British woman scientist to have been awarded a Nobel Prize, ought to be renowned in her homeland, yet she remains obscure. The author, engaged in writing the inaugural biography of Hodgkin, administers a test to acquaintances: upon disclosing the subject, those who evince recognition pass. Hodgkin was an extraordinary figure, as complex as the crystals she investigated, and her life mirrors pivotal upheavals of the twentieth century, such as the advancement of women's education and the internationalization of science. Her seminal contributions included deciphering the molecular structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which garnered her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and later insulin, pushing crystallographic techniques into realms of unprecedented complexity. Concurrently, she nurtured a family with three children and a husband frequently absent due to his historical pursuits. The pervasive 'two cultures' mentality, which posits an insurmountable chasm between the arts and sciences, often relegates scientific biographies to obscurity, perpetuating the fallacy that scientists lead less engaging lives. However, Hodgkin's ability to integrate disparate facets of her existence into a coherent whole exemplifies how scientific passion and personal life can intertwine, underscoring the value of such narratives in fostering public appreciation for scientific heritage."

Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases
A
Abyss
Long before Titanic, director James Cameron made this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks. Production design and special effects are hugely impressive. It's only the dialogue and characterisation that creak For all the craftsmanship which goes Into the film-making, the story Itself IS strictly B-movie material.
B
The Thin Red Line
The video release of this version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal directed by Andrew Marton makes a fascinating counterpart to Terrence Malick's new film. Whereas Malick's approach IS mystical and poetic, Marton made a much more conventional war movie. albeit one that is often truer to the book. He concentrated on a single soldier, and on his relationship with his abrasive sergeant. Malick's film IS Infinitely richer and more complex, but Marton's version has ItS moments. The flashback sequence, In which the soldier dreams of the wife he longs for, is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus Imagery of the woman on the swing.
C
On Guard
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this corny but highly watchable swashbuckler IS a cut above most musketeer adventures It has a consummate villain In Fabrice Luchini's clammy politician, orchestrating death and destruction behind the scenes Vincent Perez makes an exuberant (If rather short-lived) hero, and while Daniel Auteuil is perhaps too moody a presence for a romp like this, he too has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film-makers peddle costume-drama cliches with so much Wit and sparkle It never seems to matter.
D
Character
A handsome but dour tale, set In turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The excessively detailed production and costume design leave the film looking like a museum piece. Taking his cue from the surroundings, Jan Decleir is endlessly morose as the brutal bailiff Dreverhaven, who behaves ruthlessly when evICting tenants. HIS antagonistic relationship with his son IS at the core of the story, but the film-makers seem too busy laYing on the period detail to do Justice to the dark and vicious parable.
E
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
This digitally re-mastered video re-release shows off director Leone's craftsmanship to ItS best advantage. The sound editing, in particular, stands out every footstep, creaking floorboard or barking dog registers loud and clear. The storytelling IS relentlessly cruel and whenever there's a lull, It only takes a burst of Morricone's magnificent music to quicken the pulse On a moral level, there Isn't much to distinguish between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef) and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all of whom seem equally unscrupulous as they maraud across the post- Civil War West.

The Longest Day
'Forty-eight International stars' trumpets the publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic. With four directors and 23,000 extras as well, this is one pudding which is definitely over-egged The early sequences, in which the battle-hardened veterans walt for confirmation of when the invasion will happen, drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers.

The waiting sequences drag, and while logistically impressive, it is best experienced on a large screen rather than video.","Films on video. Film critic Nick James evaluates several recent releases. A: Abyss. Directed by James Cameron prior to Titanic, this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller depicts oil riggers and naval specialists endeavoring to salvage a nuclear submarine stranded miles beneath the ocean. The banter and self-deprecating bravery of the characters evoke memories of Howard Hawks' laconic heroes, with highly impressive production design and special effects, though the dialogue and characterization are weak, rendering the story B-movie material. B: The Thin Red Line. The video version of Andrew Marton's adaptation of James Jones' novel about the Guadalcanal battle serves as a fascinating contrast to Terrence Malick's mystical and poetic film. Marton's approach is more conventional, concentrating on a single soldier and his relationship with an abrasive sergeant, and it includes moments such as a harshly handled flashback that may surpass Malick's soft-focus imagery. C: On Guard. Loosely derived from Paul Féval's 1875 novel, this corny yet highly watchable swashbuckler surpasses typical musketeer adventures. It features a consummate villain in Fabrice Luchini's character and an exuberant hero played by Vincent Perez, with Daniel Auteuil contributing effectively as an acrobat-turned-swordsman, all presented with wit and sparkle that elevate the clichés. D: Character. A handsome but dour narrative set in turn-of-the-century Rotterdam, where excessive production and costume design give it a museum-like quality. Jan Decleir portrays a brutal bailiff in a morose manner, whose ruthless eviction practices and antagonistic relationship with his son form the core, though the film prioritizes period detail over the dark parable. E: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. This digitally remastered re-release showcases director Leone's craftsmanship optimally, with standout sound editing that captures every detail. The storytelling is relentlessly cruel, punctuated by Morricone's magnificent music to maintain tension, and morally, the characters—Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach—are equally unscrupulous in their marauding across the post-Civil War West. F: The Longest Day. Boasting forty-eight international stars and extensive production elements, this Darryl Zanuck epic is over-egged, with early sequences that drag as battle-hardened veterans await invasion confirmation. Logistically impressive but aesthetically lacking, it demands the big screen for full effect, as the panned-and-scanned video version diminishes the experience.","Films on video
Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases
A
Abyss
Long before Titanic, director James Cameron made this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks. Production design and special effects are hugely impressive. It's only the dialogue and characterisation that creak For all the craftsmanship which goes Into the film-making, the story Itself IS strictly B-movie material.
B
The Thin Red Line
The video release of this version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal directed by Andrew Marton makes a fascinating counterpart to Terrence Malick's new film. Whereas Malick's approach IS mystical and poetic, Marton made a much more conventional war movie. albeit one that is often truer to the book. He concentrated on a single soldier, and on his relationship with his abrasive sergeant. Malick's film IS Infinitely richer and more complex, but Marton's version has ItS moments. The flashback sequence, In which the soldier dreams of the wife he longs for, is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus Imagery of the woman on the swing.
C
On Guard
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this corny but highly watchable swashbuckler IS a cut above most musketeer adventures It has a consummate villain In Fabrice Luchini's clammy politician, orchestrating death and destruction behind the scenes Vincent Perez makes an exuberant (If rather short-lived) hero, and while Daniel Auteuil is perhaps too moody a presence for a romp like this, he too has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film-makers peddle costume-drama cliches with so much Wit and sparkle It never seems to matter.
D
Character
A handsome but dour tale, set In turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The excessively detailed production and costume design leave the film looking like a museum piece. Taking his cue from the surroundings, Jan Decleir is endlessly morose as the brutal bailiff Dreverhaven, who behaves ruthlessly when evICting tenants. HIS antagonistic relationship with his son IS at the core of the story, but the film-makers seem too busy laYing on the period detail to do Justice to the dark and vicious parable.
E
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
This digitally re-mastered video re-release shows off director Leone's craftsmanship to ItS best advantage. The sound editing, in particular, stands out every footstep, creaking floorboard or barking dog registers loud and clear. The storytelling IS relentlessly cruel and whenever there's a lull, It only takes a burst of Morricone's magnificent music to quicken the pulse On a moral level, there Isn't much to distinguish between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef) and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all of whom seem equally unscrupulous as they maraud across the post- Civil War West.
F
The Longest Day
'Forty-eight International stars' trumpets the publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic. With four directors and 23,000 extras as well, this is one pudding which is definitely over-egged The early sequences, in which the battle-hardened veterans walt for confirmation of when the invasion will happen, drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers. On a logistical level (If not an aesthetic one), this is an impressive enough feat but it cries out for the big screen Panned and scanned on video, It is inevitably a diminished experience.
 ","Films on video. Film critic Nick James provides a critique of some recent cinematic releases. A: Abyss. Preceding Titanic, director James Cameron crafted this perspiratory, claustrophobic Cold War thriller, chronicling the endeavors of oil riggers and naval experts to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded at profound oceanic depths. The repartee and self-deprecating valiance of foreman Bud and his crew rekindle recollections of similarly taciturn protagonists in Howard Hawks' oeuvre. While the production design and special effects are monumentally impressive, the dialogue and characterization are antiquated; despite the meticulous craftsmanship imbued in the filmmaking, the narrative per se constitutes strictly B-movie material. B: The Thin Red Line. The video issuance of Andrew Marton's rendition of the James Jones novel, depicting the battle for Guadalcanal, proffers a compelling counterpoint to Terrence Malick's recent cinematic interpretation. Whereas Malick's methodology is mystical and poetic, Marton fabricated a more conventional war film, albeit one often more faithful to the source text. He focalized on a solitary soldier and his dynamic with an abrasive sergeant. Malick's film is infinitely more nuanced and intricate, yet Marton's version possesses its own merits; the flashback sequence, wherein the soldier fantasizes about his longed-for wife, is executed with a severity that arguably eclipses Malick's soft-focus imagery of the woman on a swing. C: On Guard. Tenuously based on Paul Féval's 1875 novel, this hackneyed but eminently viewable swashbuckler transcends the majority of musketeer escapades. It boasts a consummate antagonist in Fabrice Luchini's unctuous politician, who orchestrates carnage from behind the scenes. Vincent Perez incarnates an ebullient, albeit ephemeral, hero, and while Daniel Auteuil may be excessively brooding for such a romp, he nonetheless has his moments as an acrobat metamorphosed into a swordsman. The filmmakers venerate costume-drama tropes with such perspicacity and éclat that their deployment never seems deleterious. D: Character. A comely yet somber narrative, situated in fin-de-siècle Rotterdam, where the excessively meticulous production and costume design render the film reminiscent of a museum artifact. Taking his cue from the milieu, Jan Decleir is perennially lugubrious as the brutal bailiff Dreverhaven, who acts ruthlessly in tenant evictions. His antagonistic filial relationship constitutes the narrative crux, but the filmmakers appear overly preoccupied with superimposing period minutiae to adequately serve the dark and vicious parable. E: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. This digitally remastered video re-release accentuates director Leone's directorial prowess to its apogee. The sound editing, in particular, is salient—every footfall, creaking floorboard, or canine bark is registered with crystalline clarity. The storytelling is unremittingly brutal, and during interlulls, a crescendo of Morricone's magnificent score suffices to accelerate the pulse. On an ethical plane, there is scant distinction between the eponymous triumvirate—Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach—all of whom evince equal unscrupulousness as they pillage the postbellum Western landscape. F: The Longest Day. 'Forty-eight international stars' is the promotional fanfare for this trihorary Darryl Zanuck war epic. With a quartet of directors and 23,000 extras, this is a confection that is indubitably over-egged. The initial sequences, wherein battle-hardened veterans await confirmation of the invasion's timing, prove as tedious for the spectators as for the dramatis personae. On a logistical stratum, if not an aesthetic one, it constitutes a formidable achievement, yet it clamors for the grand screen; when panned and scanned on video, it is ineluctably an attenuated experience."
256,"Under Sarah's Spell
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt
There cannot he many artists who l10 not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist, is one. She is not remotely interested in the concept
of the artist as creator, let alone that of the artist as genius: 'It's not the artist
who is important, but the work,' she states. Janson is so self-deprecating that she would almost like you to believe that her trompe-l'oeil works paint themselves.
All of which does not bode well for a magazine interview. 'I just don't like to shout about myself,' she says, and then covers her face in horror when asked if she minds being photographed for the feature, Cut to her sitting room 30 minutes later (a wonderful space in a Hock of artists' studios in London, filled with paintings and drawings) and you find two women bent double with hysteria. Her confidence gained, the interview becomes a fascinating, amusing (and sometimes hilarious) encounter.
Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, after two years' solid drawing at art school ('the best training any artist can ever have'}, a degree in graphic illustration and a stint at a publishing house. But illustration never really satisfied her, and she joined a specialist decorator, Jim Smart ('one of the best in his day'). Smart asked her to do one trompe-l'oeil, and that was it. 'Suddenly my interest got channelled,' she says, She left to set up on her own, 'not really knowing where I was going, hut feeling that I was on the road to somewhere.' Her instinct was right.
Janson's observational skills and fascination with detail (gained through illustrating) proved essential qualities for a trompe-l'oeil artist. 'People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation.' She insists (in that self-deprecating way) that she is still learning. 'The moment you think that you've mastered a field you might as well give up.' She is also brutally honest about her 'failings' ('I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete') and is frank about her mathematical abilities. Faced with a huge commission for the domed chapel ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she became totally confused when calculating measurements. 'I thought to myself, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you
think you are?""' This habit of self-questioning and a reluctance to openly acknowledge her skills has spawned an oddly distanced attitude to her talent. Janson often speaks in the third person: 'When I finished that ceiling, I thought, ""Well I didn't do it, she did"".'
Of course, her trompe-l'oeil schemes can speak for themselves. Janson's work is in a league of its own, far above those who have jumped on the bandwagon (the art of trompe-l'oeil has experienced something of a revival, hut not with entirely satisfactory results) and she has a string of major corporate and private commissions behind her. Much of her work is inspired by architecture or made for architectural settings. There is the trompe-l'oeil dining room for one client, based on the facade of a Venetian palazzo, and the painting at the end of a corridor in a Hat, which gives the illusion that you can step into two further rooms.
There is always a danger with trompe-l'oeil, though, that once you get the joke, your attention is lost, something of which Janson is acutely aware. 'Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and then engage your imagination. That is the most important part.'
While trompe-l'oeil has to be clever, it must also, Janson believes, be personal to the client. 'I love the interaction with clients; hat is where the ideas arc horn,' she says. 'Without the rapport, the job of creating a trompe-l'oeil scheme becomes rather difficult. Some clients have firm ideas about what they want; others do not. You have to he willing to listen. You have to get inside a client's imagination.' Many have become friends, nut least because Janson practically lives with them if she works on site.
Janson is generous in praise of her clients. 'I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls.' she confesses. And, they too, seem delighted with her, which is why she is constantly busy - despite her inclination to play down her talent. 'I really don't like to shout about myself,' she repeats at the end. 'Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout.' True, perhaps, hut you could never really become bored with Janson or her work. It certainly deserves to become better known, and I am prepared to incur her wrath while I blow her trumpet.

257,"THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS
The best boat design should combine old and new, says Tom Cunliffe. And he put it into practice in his own craft, 'The Westerman'.
This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts, bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. By contrast, my own lies quietly on a tidal creek off the south coast. She was designed last year but, seeing her, you might imagine her to be 100 years old and think that her owner must be some kind of lost-soul romantic.
Perhaps I am, though I doubt it. This boat has benefited from all the magic of old-fashioned boat design, but it would have been a much harder job without the advances of modern know-how.
It has to be said, however, that despite being an indispensable tool in current design methods and boat-building practice, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life. These are often the very realities they hoped to rediscover by going to sea in the first place.
It's not that I'm suggesting that sailors should go back to enduring every hardship. It's always been important to me that my boats have a coal stove for warmth and dryness and cosy berths for sleeping. But why go cruising at all if every sail sets and furls itself?
The occasional battle with flapping canvas is surely part of a seaman's life. And for what purpose should we abandon common sense and move our steering positions from the security of the aft end to some vulnerable perch half-way to the bow? The sad answer is that this creates a cabin like that of an ocean liner, with space for a bed larger than the one at home.
For me a boat should always be a boat and not a cottage on the water. When I bought an earlier boat, Hirta, in which I circumnavigated Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner observed that she had every comfort, but no luxury. During my long relationship with her, Hirta taught me how wise he was.
Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity to speak of, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and absolutely no electronics, especially in the navigation department, yet she was the kindest, easiest boat that I have ever sailed at sea.
Back on land, however, it is a sad fact that the very antiquity of classic boats means that they need a lot of looking after. When I had a bad injury to my back, I realised that my IS-year love affair with her had to end. Searching for a younger replacement produced no credible contenders, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch.
The Westerman has never disappointed me. Although Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his right-hand man, are adept with computer-assisted design programs, Irens initially drew this boat on a paper napkin, and only later transferred his ideas to the computer. After this had generated a set of lines, he carved a model, just as boatyards did in the days of sail. Together we considered the primary embryonic vessel, then fed the design back into the electronic box for modification.
The next version was nearly right and by the time the final one appeared, the form was perfect. The completed boat has now crossed the North Atlantic and has won four out of her first six racing starts,
Her appearance is ageless, her motion at sea is a pleasure and her accommodation, much of it in reclaimed pitch pine, emanates an atmosphere of deep peace. Maybe this is because she was drawn purely as a sailing craft, without reference to any furniture we might put into her. That is the well-tried method of the sea.
In her timeless serenity, she is the living proof that it works; that there is no need to follow current fashions to find satisfaction. and that sometimes it pays to listen to the lessons of history.
Constructed in timber treated with a penetrating glue, she is totally impervious to water. Thus she has all the benefits of a glass fibre boat yet looks like, feels like and sails like the real thing. ",C1,"My dream boat is called 'The Westerman'. It is a new boat that looks old. It uses old and new ideas. Many boats today use new technology. My boat is different. It is on the coast. It has old-style design but uses modern help. New technology can make sailing too easy. I think sailors should face some challenges. My boat has a stove for heat and good beds. Sails should not set themselves. The steering should be safe at the back. A boat should be a boat, not a house on water. My old boat, Hirta, had no modern things like electricity or a fridge. But it was easy to sail. Old boats need a lot of care. I hurt my back, so I built a new boat. The Westerman was designed on paper first, then on a computer. It won races and crossed the ocean. It looks timeless and feels peaceful. It is made of wood that keeps water out. It has the good parts of new boats but feels real.","My ideal boat, 'The Westerman', mixes old and new designs. Tom Cunliffe believes in this and built his own boat. At the London Summer Boat Show, many yachts show new technology from 25 years ago. My boat rests on a tidal creek and looks 100 years old, but it is new. It uses old boat magic with modern knowledge. However, modern technology often shields sailors from the real sea life they seek. I am not against comfort; my boat has a coal stove and cosy beds. But sails should not set automatically, and steering should stay at the safe aft end. A boat should not be like a cottage on water. My previous boat, Hirta, had no pumped water, electricity, fridge, or electronics, yet it sailed kindly. Old boats require much maintenance. After a back injury, I built a new boat. The designer drew it on a napkin, then used a computer. We made a model and refined it. The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won races. It looks ageless, moves smoothly, and feels peaceful with reclaimed wood. It was designed purely for sailing, not for furniture. Made of treated wood, it is waterproof like fiberglass but looks and feels authentic.","Tom Cunliffe argues that the best boat design should integrate old and new elements, as demonstrated by his own vessel, 'The Westerman'. Currently, the Summer Boat Show in London displays numerous yachts equipped with advanced technology, most stemming from a hull-shape revolution 25 years ago. In contrast, his boat lies quietly on a south coast tidal creek; designed recently, it appears a century old, suggesting its owner might be a romantic. Cunliffe acknowledges benefiting from traditional design enhanced by modern techniques. He notes that sophisticated technology, while essential today, often isolates crews from the maritime realities they originally sought. He does not advocate for enduring all hardships—his boat includes a coal stove and comfortable berths—but questions the purpose of cruising if sails set themselves. He believes occasional struggles with sails and secure steering positions are part of seafaring life, criticizing moves that prioritize spacious cabins over practicality. For him, a boat should remain a boat, not a watery cottage. His earlier boat, Hirta, which he sailed around Britain for TV, had no modern amenities like pumped water, electricity, or electronics but was exceptionally easy to handle. However, classic boats require significant upkeep; a back injury ended his long ownership, leading him to build a new boat. The Westerman, designed by Nigel Irens and Ed Burnett, began with a sketch on a napkin before computer modeling and traditional model carving. After revisions, the final design proved perfect, enabling Atlantic crossings and race victories. The boat's ageless appearance, pleasant motion, and peaceful accommodation—featuring reclaimed pitch pine—result from a focus on sailing function over interior furnishings. Constructed with waterproof treated timber, it combines the durability of fiberglass with the authentic look and feel of a traditional boat, proving that historical lessons can yield satisfaction without following trends.","Tom Cunliffe posits that optimal boat design should amalgamate traditional and contemporary approaches, a principle he actualized in his craft, 'The Westerman'. The Summer Boat Show in London currently exhibits an array of sophisticated yachts, replete with cutting-edge technology largely derived from a hull-shape transformation a quarter-century ago. Conversely, his own vessel rests serenely on a tidal creek along the south coast; though conceived last year, its aesthetic evokes a centenarian artifact, potentially implying the proprietor is a nostalgic romantic. Cunliffe concedes that while he may embody such traits, the boat leverages the enchantment of archaic design, augmented indispensably by modern advancements. He contends, however, that despite its utility in contemporary design and construction, advanced technology frequently insulates mariners from the austere realities of nautical existence—realities often the very impetus for their maritime pursuits. He clarifies that he does not advocate for the endurance of every privation; his boats invariably incorporate amenities like coal stoves for warmth and snug berths. Yet, he queries the essence of cruising if sails automate their deployment. The sporadic contention with unruly canvas is integral to a seafarer's experience, and relocating the helm from the secure aft to a precarious position amidships, merely to accommodate opulent cabins, defies logic. For Cunliffe, a vessel must unequivocally remain a boat, not an aquatic domicile. Reflecting on his prior boat, Hirta, which he circumnavigated Britain with for a television series, the previous owner remarked it offered every comfort sans luxury. Throughout their protracted association, Hirta, devoid of pumped water, substantive electricity, refrigeration, heating, winches, and electronics—particularly in navigation—demonstrated unparalleled kindness and ease at sea. Nonetheless, the antiquity of classic boats necessitates arduous maintenance; a severe back injury compelled Cunliffe to terminate his 15-year affiliation. Finding no suitable replacement, he commissioned a new build. The Westerman, conceived by designer Nigel Irens and his associate Ed Burnett—adept in computer-aided design—originated as a sketch on a paper napkin before digital translation. After generating preliminary lines, Irens sculpted a model, echoing historical boatyard practices. Collaborative scrutiny of this embryonic form preceded electronic refinements, culminating in a flawless design. The completed boat has traversed the North Atlantic and secured victories in four of its initial six races. Its timeless visage, gratifying seakeeping, and tranquil interior—largely fashioned from reclaimed pitch pine—exude profound serenity, attributable to its design prioritization as a sailing entity, unencumbered by furniture considerations. This time-honored maritime methodology substantiates that eschewing fleeting fashions for historical wisdom yields fulfillment. Fabricated from timber treated with penetrating adhesive, the boat is utterly impervious to water, thus amalgamating the benefits of fiberglass construction with the authentic appearance, tactile quality, and sailing performance of a genuine vessel.","THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS

And for what purpose should we abandon common sense and move our steering positions from the security of the aft end to some vulnerable perch half-way to the bow? The sad answer is that this creates a cabin like that of an ocean liner, with space for a bed larger than the one at home.
For me a boat should always be a boat and not a cottage on the water. When I bought an earlier boat, Hirta, in which I circumnavigated Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner observed that she had every comfort, but no luxury. During my long relationship with her, Hirta taught me how wise he was.
Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity to speak of, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and absolutely no electronics, especially in the navigation department, yet she was the kindest, easiest boat that I have ever sailed at sea.
Back on land, however, it is a sad fact that the very antiquity of classic boats means that they need a lot of looking after. When I had a bad injury to my back, I realised that my IS-year love affair with her had to end. Searching for a younger replacement produced no credible contenders, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch.
The Westerman has never disappointed me. Although Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his right-hand man, are adept with computer-assisted design programs, Irens initially drew this boat on a paper napkin, and only later transferred his ideas to the computer. After this had generated a set of lines, he carved a model, just as boatyards did in the days of sail. Together we considered the primary embryonic vessel, then fed the design back into the electronic box for modification.
The next version was nearly right and by the time the final one appeared, the form was perfect. The completed boat has now crossed the North Atlantic and has won four out of her first six racing starts,
Her appearance is ageless, her motion at sea is a pleasure and her accommodation, much of it in reclaimed pitch pine, emanates an atmosphere of deep peace. Maybe this is because she was drawn purely as a sailing craft, without reference to any furniture we might put into her. That is the well-tried method of the sea.
In her timeless serenity, she is the living proof that it works; that there is no need to follow current fashions to find satisfaction. and that sometimes it pays to listen to the lessons of history.
Constructed in timber treated with a penetrating glue, she is totally impervious to water. Thus she has all the benefits of a glass fibre boat yet looks like, feels like and sails like the real thing. ","Tom Cunliffe propounds that the quintessential boat design ought to synthesize antiquated and novel elements, a tenet he has materialized in his personal craft, 'The Westerman'. Presently, the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with exquisite yachts, bristling with state-of-the-art technology, nearly all of which are progeny of the hull-shape revolution that transpired twenty-five years prior. In stark contrast, his own vessel reposes tranquilly upon a tidal creek off the southern coast; conceived merely last annum, its countenance might lead one to surmise it is a centenarian relic, perhaps intimating that its proprietor is a kind of lost-soul romantic. Cunliffe allows that he may indeed be such, though he harbors doubts; this boat has profited from all the sorcery of old-fashioned naval architecture, yet its realization would have been markedly more arduous absent the advancements of contemporary expertise. It must be conceded, however, that despite being an indispensable instrument in modern design methodologies and boat-building praxis, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh verities of maritime existence—verities that are often the very phenomena they aspired to rediscover by initially venturing to sea. He is not insinuating that mariners should revert to enduring every conceivable hardship; it has perpetually been paramount to him that his boats incorporate a coal stove for warmth and desiccation, along with cosy berths for repose. But what is the rationale for embarking on a cruise if every sail deploys and retracts autonomously? The intermittent struggle with flapping canvas is indubitably an integral component of a seaman's life. Moreover, for what purpose ought we to jettison common sense and transmute our steering positions from the security of the aft extremity to some vulnerable perch midway to the bow? The lamentable retort is that this facilitates a cabin analogous to that of an ocean liner, replete with space for a bed more expansive than the domestic one. For Cunliffe, a boat should invariably remain a boat and not metamorphose into a cottage on the water. When he procured an antecedent boat, Hirta, in which he circumnavigated Britain for a televised race series, the preceding owner observed that she possessed every comfort yet no luxury. During his protracted affiliation with her, Hirta inculcated in him the sagacity of that observation. Her sails were ponderous, and she lacked pumped water, negligible electricity, refrigeration, central heating, winches, and unequivocally no electronics, particularly in the navigation domain; notwithstanding, she was the most benevolent, most facile boat he has ever sailed upon the ocean. Conversely, ashore, it is a melancholy reality that the very antiquity of classic boats necessitates copious maintenance. When he sustained a grievous injury to his back, he apprehended that his quindecennial amour with her must conclude. Scrutinizing for a junior surrogate yielded no credible contenders, so he resolved to construct a new boat ab initio. The Westerman has never disappointed him. Although Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his principal adjunct, are adepts with computer-assisted design programs, Irens initially delineated this boat upon a paper napkin, and only subsequently transposed his conceptions to the computer. After this generated a set of lines, he carved a model, precisely as boatyards did in the epoch of sail. Collaboratively, they contemplated the primary embryonic vessel, then reintroduced the design into the electronic apparatus for modification. The subsequent iteration was nearly correct, and by the time the ultimate one materialized, the form was impeccable. The consummated boat has now traversed the North Atlantic and has prevailed in four of her initial six racing commencements. Her appearance is ageless, her motion at sea is a delight, and her accommodation, substantially fashioned from reclaimed pitch pine, emanates an aura of profound peace. Perhaps this is because she was delineated purely as a sailing craft, without allusion to any furniture one might install within her. That is the well-attested methodology of the sea. In her timeless serenity, she is the living substantiation that it functions; that there is no necessity to adhere to contemporary vogues to attain gratification, and that occasionally it is remunerative to heed the didacticisms of history. Fabricated from timber treated with a penetrating adhesive, she is utterly impervious to water. Thus, she amalgamates all the advantages of a glass fibre boat yet evinces the appearance, tactile sensation, and sailing characteristics of the veritable article."
258,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet 
Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Yet one of his greatest accomplishments, in the eyes of his contemporaries, was to chart, using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore, the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now known as 'declination', that is, the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without it, sailors were unable to correct their compasses. It was therefore impossible to deduce longitude precisely and navigate the oceans.
So it was that Halley, one of only two men in the land at that time paid to conduct scientific research, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands with the grand plan of charting declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time.
This voyage took him and his crew to Rio de Janeiro, down past South Georgia, up again to Newfoundland and back to England. From these travels Halley published, in 170I, a 'New and Correct Chart shewing the Variations of the Compasse in the Western and Southern Oceans'. More sophisticated successors to this primitive cartographic effort proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century, before a slow change in the terrestrial magnetic field rendered them inaccurate.
If all goes well, Halley's accomplishments will be celebrated once again. Dr Clark, himself a keen sailor, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore.
PS70,000 will have to be raised before he embarks, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is providing support for his efforts to do this. Dr Clark became fascinated by Halley during a two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read biographies of the great scientist. 
'Halley led a remarkable life: Dr Clark says. 'He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the positions of the stars, and also found time for other interests.'
It was during this period that Halley developed a diving bell and also advised Sir Isaac Newton during his writing of Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Recreating the voyage, Dr Clark says, will afford Halley the recognition he deserves. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific merit.
It will involve making the measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. These measurements need to be updated because the terrestrial magnetic field is slowly but constantly changing.
The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field, called the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. That's because you need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr Clark.
'On our expedition we can use global positioning satellites to determine that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have offered to supply instruments. By chance, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements over the globe.
Dr Clark hopes that his measurements will plug any gaps in its coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and, he points out, it is also useful to have ground-based measurements as a comparison. It is easy to forget just how significant Halley's Atlantic journey really was. It was the first dedicated scientific expedition on the seas and Halley became the first civilian who was appointed naval captain to pursue what many regarded as an obsession with declination. Does Dr Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success?
As well as spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews.
And does he share Halley's obsessive trait? 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley, and his fascinating life, have given me a real sense of purpose.'

259,"Beginner Takes All
Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph
The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans, screenwriter, producer and aspiring director. The year began badly when Life and Limb, a film project he had been working on for months, fell through 'almost overnight'. His disappointment mingled with stomach-churning worry: it had been two years since he had earned any money and the promise of that film had been the only buffer between him and an increasingly irate bank manager.
A wise man, finding himself in Evans' position, would have got a job. He could have gone back to being a television executive, or begun a television project that had been on hold. Instead, he made a decision that most people, Evans included, would consider insane. He bought a ticket to America and set off for three months to research his first novel.
Although he was acting very much on impulse, the seeds for the story had been with him for some time, sown by a farrier he met on Dartmoor while staying with a friend. The farrier had told him the story of a docile horse that had turned, no one knew why, into a fiend. Its owners were desperate until they heard of a gypsy who, simply by talking to the animal, transformed its temperament in a matter of hours. Such men, the farrier said, were known as 'horse whisperers'.
Evans' imagination was captured. He began researching the subject with a view to writing a screenplay - he was, after all, a film-maker. But disillusionment with the film world following the demise of Life and Limb prompted him to write the story as a book. And so throughout the spring he drove across the US, stopping at ranches and learning about horses and the men who work with them.
'It was a funny time,' he says now. 'I was observing people, but essentially [ was alone and I really felt as though my life was falling apart. ['d tried for ten years to make a go of it as a film-maker, and here 1was, hugely in debt and wondering how [ was going to feed the children, and thinking maybe it was all just folly.'
He thought that again towards the end of August, by which time he had returned home and written the first half of the book. 'At that point the bank manager was getting really very heavy with us, and I needed to know whether it was worth going on. I plucked up the courage to show it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and said it was ""fine"".'
When pushed, he ventured that Evans might get $30,000 as an advance on the book. 'I had in mind how much 1 needed to payoff a bit of the overdraft and keep us going, and it was more than that. ['d spent seven months on The Horse Whisperer, and there were at least another two to go. $30,000 was a really difficult figure. I was also advised to write a 12-page synopsis of the remainder of the book.'
In October. together with the first two hundred pages of the novel. this was sent to seven UK publishers on the eve of their departure for the annual spending spree at the internationally renowned Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days his agent was on the telephone to report that he had just turned down the first offer of $75,000. 'I said, ""You what?"" And he said, ""It's OK, I just sense something is happening"". '
The events that followed have become publishing history. Within a week - a week of hotly contested auctions - the novel had been sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for 5550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for 53.I5 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel.
'We couldn't believe it; we sat there with our jaws gaping. W e'd never sent the manuscript to New York, we still don't know how it got there,' Evans says. Nor did they send it to Hollywood, but within that same week the major studios were fighting over it. 'My agent in the UK wisely involved an agent over there and when he phoned us to say, ""I think we can get $3 million outright,"" we laughed in disbelief.'
As they all agreed to this sum, it was decided that they should each 'pitch' to Evans. And so, one night in October, he sat in his study while four great film-makers rang, one after the other, to beg for the privilege of paying 53 million for an unfinished novel. Evans told me all this as we sat drinking coffee on a wooden verandah perched above the leafy garden of his home. He said that he had since turned down an offer to write the screenplay of Tile Horse Whisperer.
'It's all been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to spoil it. Writing at that level is a very tough business, and I don't want to become an employee of these people who I like and who have paid me so much money. I'd hate to find myself writing a draft or two and then have them say, ""Thanks Nick, but now we'll bring in so-and-so"". '
He would be involved, he said, but at arm's length.

Concurrently, Hollywood studios engaged in a bidding war for adaptation rights, yet Evans declined to pen the screenplay to circumvent potential artistic subjugation, instead resolving to focus on subsequent novelistic pursuits."
260,"Hit and miss of mass marketing

AS ALMOST everyone knows, advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite.
Advertising's problems are more fundamental, and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are. That is the principal way in which advertising has gone astray.
Think about your own shopping habits. If you visit a supermarket you may leave with 30, 40 or perhaps 50 items listed on your check-out bill, the average number of items of all kinds purchased per visit of all kinds.
Many of these will not be advertised brands; some others will be multiple purchases of the same brand. At a maximum you will have bought a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands. 
Consumer durables? Perhaps a dozen a year. Cars? If yours is a new car, the statistical likelihood is that it is supplied by your employer.
If it isn't, you only buy one every three years. And though it may seem otherwise, you do not buy that many clothes either, and most of them will not be advertised brands.
Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. Compare that figure with the 32,500 branded goods and services that, according to Media Register, are advertised. Let's ignore the 23,000 which spend less than PS50,000 a year, and concentrate on the 9,500 brands that Media Register Individually lists and analyses.
Mr and Mrs Average have bought 400 of that 9,500, and not all because of their advertising. That's about 4 per cent. So you can forget that naive claim usually attributed to Lord Leverhulme: 'Half of my advertising is wasted but I've no way of knowing which half.' You could say that 96 per cent of all advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96 per cent.
When you're watching TV tonight, count how many of the commercials are for brands you buy or are likely to buy in the future. For most people the figure seems to be about one in 16 (6 per cent) so the commercials for the other 15 (94 per cent) are, on the face of it, wasted.
You probably think you're a special case, that you are impervious to advertising. Almost everyone thinks the same. But you aren't and they aren't. The truth is nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised.
Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. The notion that every reader of a publication or every viewer of a commercial break might immediately rush out and buy all or even many of the brands advertised is ludicrous. People register only a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest, so waste cannot be avoided. That does not mean advertising isn't cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.
Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority, because the advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments. Media advertising works, despite its much publicised expense, because it is a cheap means of mass communication.
Nonetheless, all waste is gruesome. With smart targeting the advertiser can minimise the wastage by increasing the percentage of readers or viewers who will respond; but he can never know precisely who will respond. Even the most accurate and finely tuned direct mail-shot never achieves a 100 per cent response. This is one of the fundamental differences between the use of media and face-to-face selling. It is possible, just, to envisage a salesman scoring with every prospective client he speaks to. The same could never happen when media are used. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly.
This is as true of Birth, Marriage and Death notices as it is of soft drink commercials. Any advertiser who can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population) is doing well. Of soap powder, the two top-selling brands in supermarkets would be delighted with a million extra customers. So that any advertising campaign, for any product (or any political party for that matter) which could win over 2 per cent of the population would be outstandingly successful: and that, as I began by saying, is but a tiny minority of the population.
The most cost-effective way to reach them may be the use of mass media, but if advertising is to get going again its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before.",C1,"Advertising is not doing well. It is because of big changes in the world. Advertisers try to sell to many people, but people buy only a few things. For example, in a supermarket, you buy about 50 items. But the store has 15,000 items. You only buy a few advertised brands. In a year, you buy about 400 brands. But there are 9,500 brands that advertise a lot. So, 96% of advertising is wasted. When you watch TV, you see many ads. But you only like one in 16 ads. This means most ads are wasted. Advertising must talk to many people to find the few who will buy. It is cheap to talk to many people. But advertisers should try to talk to the right people more.","Advertising is in a bad situation. It started to go down before the recession. The problem is that advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people and big media. But now, there are many brands and media, so groups are smaller. Even big brands should target small groups, but they often do not. Think about shopping: in a supermarket, you buy 30 to 50 items on average. The store has 15,000 items. You buy only a few advertised brands. Over a year, you buy about 400 brands. But 9,500 brands advertise a lot. So, 96% of advertising is wasted. When watching TV, about one in 16 ads is for something you might buy. Advertising must reach many people to find the few who respond. It is a cheap way to talk to many people. To improve, advertising needs to target better.","Advertising is currently struggling, and this decline began before the recession due to more fundamental issues. Advertisers focus on mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target audiences have become fragmented. Even for major brands, campaigns should aim at minority groups, but this is rarely done. Consider your shopping habits: in a supermarket, you might purchase 30 to 50 items from 15,000 available, with only a few being advertised brands. Annually, you likely buy no more than 400 different brands, compared to 9,500 that are heavily advertised. This means about 96% of advertising is wasted. When watching TV, only one in 16 commercials is for a product you might buy. Advertising waste is inherent because it must communicate with large audiences to reach the small percentage who will respond, and it remains cost-effective as a cheap mass communication tool. However, to recover, advertising must become more precisely targeted.","Advertising is experiencing a significant downturn, which commenced prior to the recession and stems from deeper, global issues. Advertisers persist in employing mass marketing strategies, yet the proliferation of brands and media has led to fragmented target markets. Ideally, campaigns for major brands should be directed at specific minority audiences, but this is seldom implemented. Reflect on personal consumption: during a supermarket visit, one typically acquires 30 to 50 items from 15,000 product lines, with merely a handful being advertised brands. Annually, consumers purchase approximately 400 brands, whereas 9,500 are actively advertised, resulting in roughly 96% wastage. Television viewing reveals that only about 6% of commercials are relevant to one's buying habits. This inefficiency is inherent in media advertising, as it must engage broad audiences to identify the responsive minority, proving cost-effective due to its economical mass reach. Nevertheless, for advertising to revitalize, messages must be more tightly targeted to minimize waste.","Hit and miss of mass marketing

261,"A history of the apple

Apples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size. But the late twentieth century is in danger of squandering its heritage.

Prehistoric wilding 8,000 BC

Human beings have been munching apples since prehistoric times. They spat out apple-pips in neolithic Britain. And 10,000 years ago they left apple remains to carbonise around their Swiss and Italian lakeside homes. In Switzerland and in the regions adjoining the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even appear to have dry-stored apple-halves for winter. But these were wild crab apples, tiny wizened fruit which, in Ancient Britain came to be known as 'windings'. They had little in common with the apples we know today.

Norman knowledge 1000 AD

From the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended.

Mediaeval favourites 1200

Several kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word 'costermonger' - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street. But prosperity declined as the country was hit by successive droughts, the Black Death and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced and more were imported. This went on until the sixteenth century when Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with a 'great store of grafts' including the famous Pippins, from which he grew the first ever modern-style orchard at Teynham in Kent.

Settler treasure 1750

By the seventeenth century apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who sailed to Canada, Australia, die US, South Africa and New Zealand took apples and apple-pips with them, counting these among their most treasured possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Settlement, took them to South Africa and the Pilgrim Fathers who boarded the Mayflower carried them to America. In North America the most famous apple-planter was john Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted seedling nurseries from Pennsylvania in the east through Ohio into Indiana in the west. The Indians regarded him as a medicine man and his apple-tree enthusiasm, odd clothing and religious devotion - he distributed religious tracts tom in pans for widespread circulation - stayed many folktales. He was said, for example, to be so kind to Gods creatures that he even slept with bears.

Modem Delicious 1850 

About this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer called Jesse Hiatt discovered something sprouting from the roots of a dead tree. The shoot grew into an apple tree bearing a totally new apple which Hiatt named 'Hawkey'. He sent it to a fruit show and on biting into one the judge exclaimed 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895 the apple was introduced to the trade as a 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

Granny Smith 1850

Another of the most famous modern apples was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of transported convicts, Maria was fiercely independent, rejecting both the criminal life of her parents and the bureaucratic hypocrisy of the colonial administration. She worked as a midwife in the small township of Eastwood in New South Wales, where she was known as 'Granny-Smith' because she took on responsibility for maintaining the farm and orchard, which was the family's main source of income. One day in 1868 she found a small tree pushing its way through a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and before long was harvesting the world's first major crop of green apples, soon to be famous all over the world. When asked how the tree came about she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish' - a comment which referred not only to the fruit but also her own convict origins.

Uniformity ales 1950

Apples are now grown all over the world from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to small luxury orchards throughout Africa. Most, though, are grown commercially and come from just half a dozen varieties - usually chosen for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. While amateur gardeners in the UK have kept many old apple varieties alive, the US has lost forever most of the apples it had 100 years ago.
But consumers are starting to demand more variety. We can't leave the responsibility of saving diversity in our apples - or any other food - up to the random selections of amateur gardeners. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all.",C1,"Apples have a long history. People ate wild apples long ago. They were small and not like today's apples. Later, people learned to grow better apples. Monks in Britain made new kinds. Some apples became famous, like the Delicious and Granny Smith. Now, many apples are the same type. We need more kinds of apples to keep them different and good.","Apples have been eaten since ancient times. Early humans ate wild crab apples. Later, the Romans and Normans brought new apple types to Britain. British monks developed more varieties. Famous apples like the Pearmain and Costard were popular long ago. Settlers took apples to new countries. Johnny Appleseed planted many trees in America. In the 1800s, new apples like Delicious and Granny Smith were found. Today, most apples are similar, but people want more diversity to protect different kinds.","Apples have a rich history dating back to prehistoric times, when people consumed wild crab apples. Over centuries, knowledge from the Romans and Normans improved apple cultivation in Britain, leading to varieties such as the Pearmain and Costard. Settlers spread apples worldwide, with figures like Johnny Appleseed promoting their growth. In the 19th century, new types like the Delicious and Granny Smith apples were discovered and became globally popular. However, modern commercial farming has reduced diversity, with only a few varieties grown for their appearance and durability. It is important to preserve apple diversity for future generations.","Apples have been part of human history since prehistoric eras, with evidence of wild crab apples being consumed and stored by ancient societies. The Romans and Normans introduced advanced horticultural techniques to Britain, where monastic efforts fostered the development of numerous apple varieties, including the Pearmain and Costard. As settlers migrated, they carried apples to new continents, exemplified by Johnny Appleseed's extensive plantings in North America. The 19th century saw the emergence of iconic apples such as the Delicious and Granny Smith, originating from serendipitous discoveries. In contemporary times, commercial prioritization of uniformity threatens genetic diversity, underscoring the necessity to advocate for the conservation of varied apple types to sustain ecological and culinary richness.","A history of the apple

The 19th century witnessed fortuitous discoveries, including the Delicious apple from Iowa and the Granny Smith from Australia, which ascended to international prominence.

262,"Vancouver

In the last ten years or so, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver, in western Canada. To relax in the evening, residents stroll down the city streets and, if you join them, you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. People come to Vancouver for its mild climate, its wonderful setting between the ocean and the mountains, its clean and safe environment and its educational and job opportunities. And much as some may grumble about the speed at which new buildings have sprung up, there's no doubt that the new arrivals and flourishing tourism industry have helped fuel an urban renaissance. Locals once referred to Vancouver as 'Terminal City' because of the city's role as a terminus or gateway to all other places. Though the name has fallen slightly out of favour, Vancouver is more a gateway than ever.

Putting Pen to Paper

Journalists like myself are usually poor letter-writers. I have heard it said that this is because of the instinctive distaste we feel at writing something we are not going to be paid for, but I cannot believe we have quite such mercenary characters. It is more probably that since in our work, we are always striving to get the greatest possible effect, the essential spontaneity of a letter escapes us. The real creative artist, who does not consciously work on the effect at all (though he may rewrite a passage dozens of times), does not have this problem. I believe that it is in this inherent grasp of the effect of his words that there lies the only sure test of the real artist. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines he surely never thought consciously that it was the contrast between polysyllables that made them so effective, as well as showing him to be a great writer.

Supermarket Opening

The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely on a soap star, a disc jockey or a minor member of the royal family to come down and cut the ribbon. Now it seems that new branches are popping up every day in many areas and so the poor old celebrity has become superfluous. Why pay a famous person when any Tom, Dick or Harry will open it for nothing? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new branch of Superbuy, so long as they were at the front. According to one prospective customer who knew someone who worked there, the first five men over the threshold would be getting a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This snippet of information quickly swept through the crowd, instilling feelings of smug superiority among those at the front, and envy from the latecomers.
",C2,"Vancouver is a city in Canada. Many people from around the world now live there. In the evening, people walk on the streets. You can hear many languages. People like Vancouver because the weather is nice. It is by the ocean and mountains. It is clean and safe. There are schools and jobs. Some people do not like new buildings, but new people and tourists help the city. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Now, it is still a gateway. Journalists often do not write letters well. Maybe because they are used to writing for money. Or maybe because they try too hard to make their writing good. Real artists do not have this problem. They know how to use words well. Shakespeare was a great writer. He did not think about big words, but his writing was very good. In Britain, when a new supermarket opened, a famous person would cut a ribbon. Now, many new supermarkets open. Famous people are not needed. Anyone can open it for free. Last week, old people waited for a new Superbuy store to open. They did not care who opened it. They wanted to be first. The first five men would get aftershave. The first five women would get flowers. People at the front felt happy. People who came late felt sad.","Vancouver is a city in western Canada.

Journalists like me are usually bad at writing letters. Some say it is because we do not like to write without pay, but I do not think we are that selfish. It is more likely that in our work, we always try to create big effects, so we lose the natural feel of a letter. Real creative artists do not have this problem because they do not focus on effects, even if they rewrite many times. I believe that knowing how words affect people is what makes a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about using big words to show he was great; it just happened. In Britain, opening a new supermarket used to be a special event. A soap star, disc jockey, or royal family member would cut the ribbon. Now, many new supermarkets open often, so celebrities are not needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners did not care who opened the new Superbuy branch; they just wanted to be first. Someone said the first five men would get aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers.

Although some residents grumble about the rapid construction of new buildings, there is no doubt that the influx of new arrivals and a flourishing tourism industry have contributed to an urban renaissance. The city was once nicknamed 'Terminal City' due to its role as a terminus or gateway to other destinations. While this name has become less popular, Vancouver continues to function as a gateway more than ever. Journalists, such as myself, are generally poor letter-writers. It has been suggested that this is because of an instinctive reluctance to write without payment, but I doubt we are so mercenary. A more probable reason is that in our profession, we constantly strive for maximum impact, which causes us to lose the essential spontaneity of personal letters. Genuine creative artists, who do not consciously work on effects even if they revise extensively, do not face this issue. I believe that the true test of a real artist lies in their inherent understanding of how their words create an effect. When Shakespeare composed his famous lines, he surely never consciously considered that the contrast between polysyllables made them effective and demonstrated his greatness. In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a notable event, often featuring a soap star, disc jockey, or minor royal to cut the ribbon. However, with new branches appearing frequently in many areas, celebrities have become unnecessary. Why pay a famous person when any ordinary individual will open it for free? Last week, pensioners waiting for the new Superbuy branch did not care about the opener; they only wanted to be at the front. According to a prospective customer with insider knowledge, the first five men would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This information quickly circulated through the crowd, instilling feelings of smug superiority in those at the front and envy in the latecomers.","In recent years, Vancouver in western Canada has become home to hundreds of thousands of people from across the globe. Residents often take evening strolls through the city streets, and if you accompany them, you are likely to overhear a different language at nearly every step. The appeal of Vancouver lies in its mild climate, magnificent setting between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and the educational and job opportunities it offers. While some may complain about the speed at which new buildings have emerged, there is no question that the new arrivals and a thriving tourism sector have fueled an urban renaissance.

Journalists like myself are usually poor letter-writers. I have heard it said that this is because of the instinctive distaste we feel at writing something we are not going to be paid for, but I cannot believe we have quite such mercenary characters. It is more probably that since in our work, we are always striving to get the greatest possible effect, the essential spontaneity of a letter escapes us. The real creative artist, who does not consciously work on the effect at all (though he may rewrite a passage dozens of times), does not have this problem.

Supermarket Opening

The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely on a soap star, a disc jockey or a minor member of the royal family to come down and cut the ribbon. Now it seems that new branches are popping up every day in many areas and so the poor old celebrity has become superfluous. Why pay a famous person when any Tom, Dick or Harry will open it for nothing? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new branch of Superbuy, so long as they were at the front.

263,"Philadelphia Avenue

I headed down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The dusk had deepened, the humidity thickened into a palpable, prickly drizzle that lent my walk a heightened feeling of sheltered stealth. I knew this side of the street from the dawn of consciousness; our neighbours the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the Kring's and the Pottses' houses where my first playmates, all girls, lived. These houses down the street, though not every inhabitant was known by name to me, had each been as distinct to my childish awareness as the little troughs in the cement which led rain from their roof gutters out through the sidewalk to the street, and which punctuated my progress on roller skates or on my scooter. As the street sloped downward, there was a just-perceptible descent in the social scale as well: the porches got lower to the ground, and the front yards became exiguous. Over the years, there had been changes: wooden porch banisters and pillars had been replaced by wrought iron, in a vaguely Southern or Spanish style. Throughout Shillington, not only had houses I remembered as homes become stores but, stranger still, stores - Pep Conrad's up on Franklin and Second, Han Kieffer's here - had reverted to being homes. How had the residents divided up those open, shelved spaces? How did they live with all those ghostly aromas of merchandise?

Furniture designer Rick Gilbert's flat is a former curtain warehouse. It has the conventional features of the classic loft space, in this instance, exposed brickwork and gigantic doors, through which curtains were once hoisted from trains on the adjacent railway track. But Gilbert was adamant that he didn't want a brutally empty, open-plan space - for practical as much as aesthetic reasons.
'In my last place, living and working spaces were integrated. It was hard to switch off or start work in full view of the living area.'
Refusing to conform to the loft-dwelling convention of open-plan living, he broke up the space near the entrance with a giant snaking sheet of corrugated plastic. 'It hides the office, creates a hallway, and guides the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral zone, where I can either cook dinner for friends or make coffee for clients.'
To offset the synthetic look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert laid the floors with a light wood. And while his futuristic chairs and sofas litter the flat, its also stuffed with rather more sentimental and homely furniture, given to him by his parents or bought from markets.

Bruce Chatwin

To escape or to explore? The spur behind Bice Chatwin's absurdly romantic nomadic existence has become something of a literary conundrum. Chatwin's life and art were strewn with secrets, subtle resonances and, it must be said, lies. But he was, for all that, a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, In Patagonia, published in 1977, is an awesome exercise in imagination. A travel book that reinvented travel writing, it has the animation of a thriller, the sparkle of romantic fiction and the irrepressible insight of truly extraordinary literature. Of course, even with this book, Chatwin cloaked fact with concoction; when sketching individuals and incidents, he would adjust, if not abandon, objective reality for the sake of a better twist to an anecdote, or a clean cut to the heart of what the book somehow seemed to suggest - that through travel it was possible to discover whole histories that had been lived out as if solely to excite and fascinate future explorers.

Swimming

The warm rain tumbled from the gutter in one of those midsummer downpours as I hastened across the lawn behind my house and took shelter in the pool. Breaststroking up and down, I nosed along, eyes just at water level. Each raindrop exploded in a momentary, bouncing fountain that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the storm intensified, drowning birdsong, and a haze rose off the water as though the pool itself were rising to meet the lowering sky.
It was at the height of this drenching in the summer of 1996 that the notion of a long swim through Britain began to form itself. I wanted to follow the rain on its meanderings about our land to rejoin the sea, to break out of the frustration of a lifetime doing lengths, of endlessly turning back on myself like a tiger pacing its cage.
Most of us live in a world where more and more places and things are signposted, labelled, and officially 'interpreted'. There is something about all this that is tuning the reality of things into visual reality. It is the reason why walking, cycling and swimming will always be subversive activities. They allow us to regain a sense of what is old and wild, by getting off the beaten track and breaking free of the official version of things. A swimming journey would give me access to that pan of our world which, like darkness, misty woods or high mountains, still retains most mystery.",C2,"I walked on Philadelphia Avenue.

264,"Online Literary Criticism For All

Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?

From the outset, the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice, however, a certain amount of technical know-how was required, at least in the early years.
However, there was at least one field, previously restricted to the few, that was genuinely opened up to the masses. By visiting the pages of Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, anyone was able to try their hand at literary criticism.
Amazon's egalitarian approach to book reviews -- namely, that anyone could say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars - looked, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and whenever a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically.
This meant that Amazon got to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers of a book could see what other readers thought of it, for better or worse, rather than reading just the blurb from the publisher and the views of professional critics.
Other online bookstores which also operated as large bricks-and-mortar bookshop chains provided similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted by far the greatest number of reviews and, accordingly, encountered the most funny business.
For this critical free-for-all lent itself to subversion of various subtle and not-so-subtle kinds. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day - Amazon would not say exactly how many - so it was impractical to vet them all. Instead, a team of editors scoured the site, checking that reviews conformed to the company's guidelines.
Single-word reviews, for instance, or personal attacks on the author, were not allowed. Nor were reviews that contained obscenities, gave away the ending, or referred to other reviews. Ultimately, however, the reviewers were anonymous (they were not required to give their real names) and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon checkers noticed them. So there was plenty of scope for mischief.
For example, there was nothing to stop writers giving their own books glowing reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was so mortified by the bad reviews that readers gave his first novel ('infantile trash', 'puerile pap') that he submitted several anonymous ones of his own ('hilarious', 'fabulous') to redress the balance. His ruse succeeded until he wrote an article detailing his deception. The fake reviews were promptly removed. 
Authors were, in fact, provided with their own way to hold forth: by clicking on a link marked 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors who used this feature posted jolly messages expressing their desire that browsers would buy, and enjoy, the book in question. A few even gave their email addresses, thus inviting readers to communicate directly. Yet authors who posted messages knew that while Amazon did vet them, it did not check that they really came from the author.
An exception to this was made in the case of big names. A little-known writer submitted an authors comment, purporting to be from John Updike, in which he admitted to being a 'talented but ultimately over-hyped middlebrow author'. Unsurprisingly, it was deemed a fake and was removed.
Still, the fur really began to fly as a result of postings from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's We've Got Spirit, which documented a year in the life of a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well received by the mainstream press. But many of the people mentioned in it felt betrayed, and the books page on Amazon was an obvious outlet for their anger. Dozens of highly critical reviews were submitted - only to vanish a few days later.
Despite this episode, as far as Amazon was concerned, the fact that so many people were prepared to invest so much time reading and writing reviews was simply good for business. As readers' reviews were supposed to be a 'forum to talk about a book' rather than a chat room, a particularly close eye was kept on bestselling books, to ensure that all reviews played by the rules.
This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page devoted to a less well-known book. The Story about Ping, a classic children's work that tells the story of a duck called Ping, was the inspiration for much geek humour, because 'ping' also happened to be the name of a software utility used to measure the degree of congestion on the Internet. One lengthy review constructed an elaborate analogy between the books plot and the architecture of the Internet, and concluded that the book provided a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts.
Such silliness was, however, the exception rather than the rule. The striking thing about the vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com was how seriously their contributors took them. And overall the reviews collectively provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying.
The writer George Orwell once complained that 'reviewing too many books involved constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever'. All the more reason, then, to regard the democratisation of the process as a good thing.",C2,"The internet lets everyone share their thoughts. On Amazon, people can write about books they read. They can give stars to books. This helps others decide if they want to buy the book. But sometimes, people write fake reviews. For example, an author wrote good reviews for his own book. Amazon has rules to stop bad reviews, but it is hard to check them all. Most reviews are honest and help people choose good books.","The internet was made for everyone to use. On Amazon, anyone can write a review for a book and give it stars. This is good because buyers can see what other readers think. But there are problems. Some people write fake reviews. For example, one author wrote good reviews for his own book. Amazon has rules, like no bad words or personal attacks, but they cannot check every review. Most reviews are serious and help people know if a book is good to buy.","The internet was designed to be open to all, allowing anyone to publish content. On Amazon, this meant that readers could write book reviews and rate books with stars. This system provided free reviews for Amazon and helped potential buyers make informed decisions. However, it also led to issues like fake reviews, where authors might praise their own books anonymously. Amazon had guidelines against inappropriate content, but with thousands of reviews daily, it was impossible to monitor them all. Despite some misuse, most reviews were genuine and offered reliable advice on book quality.","The foundational principle of the internet was universal access, enabling individuals to publish various materials. Amazon capitalized on this by allowing any user to submit literary critiques and assign star ratings to books. This approach furnished the site with complimentary reviews and afforded customers insights beyond publisher blurbs and professional critics. Nevertheless, the system was susceptible to manipulation, such as authors covertly endorsing their own works. Amazon enforced policies against obscenities and spoilers, yet the anonymity of reviewers and the volume of submissions limited oversight. Overall, the majority of reviews were earnest and collectively provided an accurate gauge of a book's merit.","From its inception, the internet was predicated on the notion of open access, theoretically permitting anyone to disseminate content. Amazon exemplified this by democratizing literary criticism, enabling users to post reviews and award star ratings, thereby generating free content and offering consumers perspectives distinct from those of publishers or critics. However, this egalitarian system was prone to subversion, including instances where authors anonymously lauded their own books. Amazon instituted guidelines to preclude inappropriate submissions, but the sheer volume and anonymous nature of reviews impeded comprehensive vetting. Consequently, while occasional frivolity occurred, the preponderance of reviews was characterized by seriousness, furnishing a reliable composite assessment of literary works.","Online Literary Criticism For All

Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?

From the outset, the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice, however, a certain amount of technical know-how was required, at least in the early years.
However, there was at least one field, previously restricted to the few, that was genuinely opened up to the masses. By visiting the pages of Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, anyone was able to try their hand at literary criticism.
Amazon's egalitarian approach to book reviews -- namely, that anyone could say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars - looked, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and whenever a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically.
This meant that Amazon got to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers of a book could see what other readers thought of it, for better or worse, rather than reading just the blurb from the publisher and the views of professional critics.
Other online bookstores which also operated as large bricks-and-mortar bookshop chains provided similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted by far the greatest number of reviews and, accordingly, encountered the most funny business.
For this critical free-for-all lent itself to subversion of various subtle and not-so-subtle kinds. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day - Amazon would not say exactly how many - so it was impractical to vet them all. Instead, a team of editors scoured the site, checking that reviews conformed to the company's guidelines.
Single-word reviews, for instance, or personal attacks on the author, were not allowed. Nor were reviews that contained obscenities, gave away the ending, or referred to other reviews. Ultimately, however, the reviewers were anonymous (they were not required to give their real names) and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon checkers noticed them. So there was plenty of scope for mischief.
For example, there was nothing to stop writers giving their own books glowing reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was so mortified by the bad reviews that readers gave his first novel ('infantile trash', 'puerile pap') that he submitted several anonymous ones of his own ('hilarious', 'fabulous') to redress the balance. His ruse succeeded until he wrote an article detailing his deception. The fake reviews were promptly removed. 
Authors were, in fact, provided with their own way to hold forth: by clicking on a link marked 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors who used this feature posted jolly messages expressing their desire that browsers would buy, and enjoy, the book in question. A few even gave their email addresses, thus inviting readers to communicate directly. Yet authors who posted messages knew that while Amazon did vet them, it did not check that they really came from the author.
An exception to this was made in the case of big names. A little-known writer submitted an authors comment, purporting to be from John Updike, in which he admitted to being a 'talented but ultimately over-hyped middlebrow author'. Unsurprisingly, it was deemed a fake and was removed.
Still, the fur really began to fly as a result of postings from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's We've Got Spirit, which documented a year in the life of a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well received by the mainstream press. But many of the people mentioned in it felt betrayed, and the books page on Amazon was an obvious outlet for their anger. Dozens of highly critical reviews were submitted - only to vanish a few days later.
Despite this episode, as far as Amazon was concerned, the fact that so many people were prepared to invest so much time reading and writing reviews was simply good for business. As readers' reviews were supposed to be a 'forum to talk about a book' rather than a chat room, a particularly close eye was kept on bestselling books, to ensure that all reviews played by the rules.
This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page devoted to a less well-known book. The Story about Ping, a classic children's work that tells the story of a duck called Ping, was the inspiration for much geek humour, because 'ping' also happened to be the name of a software utility used to measure the degree of congestion on the Internet. One lengthy review constructed an elaborate analogy between the books plot and the architecture of the Internet, and concluded that the book provided a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts.
Such silliness was, however, the exception rather than the rule. The striking thing about the vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com was how seriously their contributors took them. And overall the reviews collectively provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying.
The writer George Orwell once complained that 'reviewing too many books involved constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever'. All the more reason, then, to regard the democratisation of the process as a good thing."
265,"Photography

Over the past one and a half centuries, photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the medium has expanded its capabilities in the recording of time and space, thus allowing human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment or to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. It has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. Indeed, the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition.
Nonetheless, the recording of events by means of the visual image has a much longer history. The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. And although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of the early cave paintings - whether they record the 'actual' events of hunting, whether they functioned as sympathetic magic to encourage the increase of animals for hunting, whether they had a role as religious icons, or if they were made simply to enliven and brighten domestic activities - pictorial images seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it.
Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society. The popular notion that 'seeing is believing' had always afforded special status to the visual image. So when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense.
In the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of photography appeared to offer the promise of 'automatically' providing a truthful visual record. It was seen not only as the culmination of Western visual representation but, quite simply, the camera, functioning in much the same way as the human eye, was regarded as a machine which could provide a fixed image. And this image was considered to be a very close approximation to that which we actually see. The chemical fixing of the image enabled the capture of what might be considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, the photographic image was held to be an achievement of sophisticated culture and produced the type of image that artists had struggled throughout the centuries to acquire the manual, visual and conceptual skills to create.
It may seem a further irony that, because of the cameras perceived realism in its ability to replicate visual perception, it was assumed that all peoples would 'naturally' be able to understand photographs. This gave rise to the question of whether photography constituted a 'universal language'. For example, in 1933 this view had been expressed in a series of radio broadcasts by photographer August Sander: 'Even the most isolated Bushman could understand a photograph of the heavens -- whether it showed the sun and moon or the constellations.' However, in the face of the rapid increase in global communications which characterised the latter part of the twentieth century, we do at least need to ask to what extent the photographic image can penetrate through cultural differences in understanding. Or is photography as bound by cultural conventions as any other form of communication, such as language?
Is it possible that our familiarity with the photographic image has bred our current contempt for the intricacies and subtle methods that characterise the medium's ability to transmit its vivid impressions of 'reality'? Photography is regarded quite naturally as offering such convincing forms of pictorial evidence that this process of communication often seems to render the medium totally transparent, blurring the distinction between our perception of the environment and its photographic representations. It is the most natural thing in the world for someone to open their wallet and produce a photograph saying 'this is my grandson'.
Ever since its invention in 1839, the technology of photography and the attitudes towards the medium by its practitioners have changed radically. This may partly be attributed to photography gradually moving into what might be termed 'mythic time' - its initial role as a nineteenth-century record-keeper has now moved beyond the human scale and photographic images, once immediate and close to photographer and subject alike, have now passed out of living memory. The passage of time has transformed the photograph from a memory aid into an historical document, one which often reveals as much (if not more) about the individuals and society which produced the image as it does about its subject.
I hope to show that the camera is not merely a mute, passive chronicler of events, and that photography does not just passively reflect culture, but can provide the vision and impetus that promote social and political change and development. For example, it is difficult to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century without recognising the central role of the development of perspective in bringing about new visual means of representation. Similarly, photography has made a major contribution to the bringing about of the media culture that characterises our own era, while at the same time it has assumed the ironic role of bringing the harsh realities of the world to the coffee-table.",C2,"Photography takes pictures. It started about 150 years ago. People use it to show all parts of life. It can show fast moments, big things, and small things. It brings us pictures from far places, like other countries or space. It also shows problems in society. Photography is a very important way to tell about people's lives. But drawing pictures to record things is much older. The first drawings were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We do not know why they made these drawings. Maybe for hunting, magic, religion, or to make their homes nice. Pictures have always been part of human culture. People think that if you see something, you believe it. So when photography was invented, it had a big effect on society. In the 1800s, photography was seen as a true record. The camera works like the human eye and makes a fixed image. This image is close to what we see. Photography was also a big cultural achievement. Artists had worked for years to make such images. Some thought that everyone could understand photos, like a universal language. For example, a photographer said in 1933 that even a Bushman could understand a photo of the sky. But now, with more communication, we ask if photos can be understood by all cultures. Or are they like language, different for each culture? We are so used to photos that we may not see the hard work in making them. Photos seem very real, so we often do not think about the difference between the real world and the photo. For example, someone might show a photo and say, 'This is my grandson.' Since 1839, photography has changed a lot. Photos were first used to record things in the 1800s. Now, they are old and show history. They tell us about the people and society that made them. I want to show that the camera is not just a passive tool. It does not only show culture; it can help change society. For example, in the 1400s, new ways of drawing changed culture in Italy. Similarly, photography has helped create our media culture. It also brings hard truths about the world to our homes.","Photography is the art of taking pictures. It began around 150 years ago and has been used to record all parts of human life. Over time, it has improved in capturing moments in time and space, allowing us to see quick events, very large things, and very small things. It provides images from distant places on Earth, parts of the solar system, and the complex issues of modern society. Photography is one of the most important ways to express the human experience. However, recording events with images has a much longer history. The earliest picture-making dates back about 35,000 years to the Upper Palaeolithic period, with cave paintings. We are not sure of their exact purpose—they might record hunting, serve as magic for more animals, act as religious symbols, or simply decorate living spaces. Visual images have always been connected to human culture. People often believe that seeing something makes it true, so visual images have a special status. When photography was invented, it had a huge social and cultural impact. In the mid-1800s, photography promised to give a truthful visual record automatically. It was seen as the peak of Western image-making. The camera works similarly to the human eye and produces a fixed image that is very close to what we see. The chemical process captured these images as natural phenomena. At the same time, photography was a cultural achievement, creating the kind of image artists had tried to make for centuries. Because photos seemed so realistic, some thought everyone could understand them naturally, leading to the idea that photography is a universal language. For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even a Bushman could understand a photo of the sky. But with increased global communication, we now question if photos can cross cultural barriers or if they are as culturally specific as language. Our familiarity with photos might make us overlook the skill involved in making them. Photos are so convincing that the medium often seems invisible, blurring the line between reality and the image. For example, it's common for someone to show a photo and say, 'This is my grandson.' Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and attitudes have changed greatly. This is partly because photography has entered 'mythic time'—its original role as a 19th-century recorder has expanded beyond human scale, and old photos are now historical documents that reveal much about the society that produced them. I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder; it doesn't only reflect culture but can drive social and political change. For example, the Italian Renaissance in the 1400s was shaped by new visual techniques like perspective. Similarly, photography has helped create today's media culture and brings difficult realities into everyday life.","Photography has been employed for about 150 years to document every aspect of human life and activity. Throughout its relatively brief history, the medium has enhanced its ability to record time and space, enabling people to view fleeting moments and visualize both the vast and the minute.

The earliest instances of pictorial recording trace back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, approximately 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings.

Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have arisen about the accuracy of visual images and their societal status. The adage 'seeing is believing' has always granted visual images a special credibility. Thus, when photography was invented, its social and cultural impact was profound. In the mid-19th century, photography seemed to promise an automatic, truthful visual record. It was viewed not only as the culmination of Western visual representation but also as a machine, similar to the human eye, that could produce a fixed image closely approximating actual sight. The chemical fixation of images allowed for the capture of what was considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. Concurrently, photography was regarded as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long strived to create with manual and conceptual skills. Ironically, due to the camera's perceived realism in replicating visual perception, it was assumed that all people would naturally understand photographs, leading to the notion that photography might be a universal language. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander expressed in radio broadcasts that even an isolated Bushman could comprehend a photograph of celestial bodies like the sun, moon, or constellations. However, with the rapid growth in global communications in the late 20th century, we must consider to what extent photographic images can transcend cultural differences in understanding, or if photography is as bound by cultural conventions as language. Our familiarity with photographic images may have led to a disregard for the medium's intricate methods in conveying vivid impressions of reality. Photography is often seen as providing such convincing pictorial evidence that the medium appears transparent, blurring the distinction between environmental perception and its representations. It is commonplace for someone to pull out a photograph and state, 'This is my grandson.' Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and practitioners' attitudes have changed significantly. This shift is partly due to photography entering 'mythic time'—its initial role as a 19th-century record-keeper has evolved beyond human scale, and photographs, once immediate, have become historical documents that reveal as much about the producing society as about their subjects. I hope to demonstrate that the camera is not merely a passive chronicler of events and that photography does not just reflect culture but can provide vision and impetus for social and political change. For instance, the cultural transformations of the 15th-century Italian Renaissance were closely linked to developments in perspective representation. Similarly, photography has greatly contributed to the media culture of our era while ironically bringing harsh global realities into everyday settings.","Over the past century and a half, photography has served to document all facets of human existence and endeavors. In its relatively short history, the medium has expanded its capacities for recording temporal and spatial dimensions, thereby allowing human vision to apprehend ephemeral instants and to conceptualize both the immense and the infinitesimal. It has furnished imagery from secluded global locales, remote sectors of the solar system, as well as the intricate social dynamics and crises of modern life. Indeed, the photographic medium has emerged as one of the most pivotal and influential avenues for articulating the human condition. However, the chronicling of events via visual imagery possesses a far more extensive history. The earliest manifestations of pictorial recording extend back to the Upper Palaeolithic era, approximately 35,000 years ago, with the creation of cave paintings. Although the precise intentions behind these early images remain ambiguous—whether they documented actual hunting episodes, operated as sympathetic magic to augment wildlife for hunting, functioned as religious icons, or were crafted merely to animate and embellish domestic routines—pictorial representations seem inextricably linked to human culture as we comprehend it. Throughout the evolution of visual representation, inquiries have been raised regarding the purported veracity of visual images and their standing within society. The prevalent maxim that 'seeing is believing' has perpetually conferred a privileged status upon visual imagery. Consequently, upon the invention of photography, its societal and cultural repercussions were immense. During the mid-nineteenth century, the advent of photography appeared to pledge an automatic provision of veracious visual records. It was perceived not solely as the apex of Western visual representation but, more fundamentally, the camera, operating in a manner analogous to the human eye, was esteemed as a apparatus capable of yielding a stabilized image. This image was deemed a close approximation to actual visual perception. The chemical fixation of the image facilitated the capture of what could be considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. Simultaneously, the photographic image was hailed as an accomplishment of refined culture, generating the type of imagery that artists had endeavored for centuries to master through manual, visual, and conceptual proficiencies. It may appear ironic that, owing to the camera's perceived realism in mimicking visual perception, it was presupposed that all individuals would inherently comprehend photographs, giving rise to the query of whether photography constitutes a 'universal language.' For instance, in 1933, this perspective was articulated by photographer August Sander in a series of radio broadcasts: 'Even the most isolated Bushman could understand a photograph of the heavens—whether it depicted the sun and moon or the constellations.' Nonetheless, in light of the exponential increase in global communications that characterized the latter part of the twentieth century, we must at least interrogate the extent to which photographic imagery can permeate cultural disparities in interpretation. Alternatively, is photography as constrained by cultural conventions as any other communicative form, such as language? Is it plausible that our acclimation to photographic imagery has engendered a contemporary disdain for the complexities and subtle techniques that define the medium's capacity to transmit its vivid impressions of 'reality'? Photography is routinely regarded as furnishing such persuasive forms of pictorial evidence that this communicative process often renders the medium entirely transparent, obfuscating the demarcation between our perception of the environment and its photographic depictions. It is a perfectly natural occurrence for an individual to retrieve a photograph from their wallet and proclaim, 'This is my grandson.' Ever since its inception in 1839, the technology of photography and the perspectives of its practitioners have undergone radical transformations. This may be partially ascribed to photography gradually transitioning into what might be termed 'mythic time'—its original function as a nineteenth-century archival tool has now surpassed human scale, and photographic images, once immediate and proximate to both photographer and subject, have elapsed beyond living memory. The passage of time has transmuted the photograph from a mnemonic aid into a historical document, one that frequently discloses as much, if not more, about the individuals and society that generated the image as about its subject matter. I aspire to illustrate that the camera is not merely an inert, passive recorder of events, and that photography does not simply mirror culture but can furnish the vision and momentum that foster social and political evolution. For example, it is challenging to envision the cultural shifts of the fifteenth-century Italian Renaissance without acknowledging the central role played by the advancement of perspective in inaugurating novel visual modes of representation. Similarly, photography has made a substantial contribution to the emergence of the media culture that typifies our epoch, while concurrently assuming the paradoxical role of conveying the stark realities of the world to the domestic sphere.","Throughout the past one and a half centuries, photography has been utilized to chronicle every dimension of human life and endeavor. During this comparatively brief historical span, the medium has augmented its capabilities in the documentation of temporal and spatial realms, thereby enabling human vision to apprehend transient moments and to conceptualize both the macroscopic and the microscopic.

Caves

Research establishments and university departments around the world have invested years of research time in all aspects of caves, mainly their origins, their hydrology and their biology. Caves constitute a small but rather mysterious component of the natural environment - as such they arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge, and consequently have had a considerable amount of research effort devoted to them. Furthermore, because of their presence as natural phenomena, they have had a long history of study, which has been intensified in those parts of the world where caves have had a direct effect on our way of life. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields. Indeed there is a considerable, perhaps unique, overlap between the professional, scientific study of caves and the amateur studies carried out by those who mainly visit caves for sport.

Now, we have machines like satellites and computers. They give us weather information fast. Weather words are hard for most people. But people are still important for weather forecasts. People see things that help experts understand the weather.","Clutter: Sometimes, even with many possessions, you do not feel secure. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but the desire for more things can become too strong. Modern advertising uses our fears to make us buy things. For example, ads suggest you are not good enough without certain products. To see how ads affect you, try ignoring billboards when you walk down the street. These expensive ads influence us in many ways without us noticing. We see them on TV, radio, in newspapers, on posters, and online—all telling us to buy more. Caves: Research centers and universities have spent years studying caves, focusing on how they form, their water systems, and the life inside them. Caves are a small but mysterious part of nature that spark curiosity and drive research. They have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact daily life. However, visiting caves requires physical skill, so cave research is often done by amateurs and sports enthusiasts, not just professors. Weather Watch: In the past, people without instruments used their senses to start meteorology. Since the 17th century, it has become a technical science with satellites and computers providing quick weather data. Computers solve complex math problems fast. Weather theory has many difficult words for non-experts. But human experience is still key to turning data into forecasts. Observations by people can give important clues to professionals studying the atmosphere.","Clutter: At times, having many possessions does not make you feel secure. While it is reasonable to have a nesting instinct and create a home that meets your needs, the motivation to acquire things can become excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities, with messages implying that you are inferior without certain products. To understand your own susceptibility, try avoiding advertising billboards on your next walk. These costly advertisements condition us persuasively without our awareness. We are constantly exposed to them through television, radio, print media, posters, clothing, and the internet, all urging us to purchase more. Caves: Institutions worldwide have invested significant research into caves, particularly their origins, hydrology, and biology. Caves are a minor yet enigmatic part of the natural environment, arousing curiosity and prompting extensive study. They have a long history of research, intensified in regions where caves influence lifestyles. However, the physical demands of cave exploration mean that research is not dominated by academics; instead, there is considerable overlap with amateur studies by those who explore caves for sport. Weather Watch: Meteorology began with observant individuals using only their senses, evolving since the 17th century into a highly technical field. Satellites and electronic tools deliver rapid weather data, and computers quickly solve intricate calculations. Meteorological theory includes specialized terminology that is unclear to laypeople. Nevertheless, human experience remains crucial for interpreting data into forecasts, and personal observations can provide valuable insights for experts investigating atmospheric mysteries.","Clutter: Occasionally, no matter how many belongings you possess, you may not experience a sense of security. Although it is natural to have a basic nesting instinct and establish a home that fulfills your requirements, there can be a point where the drive to accumulate items becomes uncontrollable. Furthermore, contemporary advertising is intentionally crafted to target our insecurities, consistently conveying that lacking certain products diminishes your worth. To gauge your own influence, I challenge you to refrain from reading any advertising billboards during your next street outing. These multimillion-dollar messages relentlessly and persuasively condition us without our realization. We are inundated by advertisements across various media—television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, apparel, and the internet—all promoting consumption. Caves: Research establishments and university departments globally have dedicated years to investigating caves, primarily their origins, hydrology, and biology. Caves represent a small but rather mysterious element of the natural world, thus stimulating our curiosity and compelling research efforts. Additionally, due to their status as natural phenomena, they have a protracted history of study, especially in areas where caves directly affect human lifestyles. However, the physical agility necessary to access many caves means that cave research has involved more amateur participation than in other scientific disciplines, resulting in a significant overlap between professional scientific inquiry and amateur studies conducted by sporting enthusiasts. Weather Watch: Initially, countless attentive people relying solely on their senses laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has advanced from the 17th century into today's highly technical science. Satellites and electronic instruments transmit copious weather data with minimal delay, while computers resolve abstruse mathematical problems at speeds surpassing human capability. Meteorological theory is replete with esoteric terms that hold little meaning for non-specialists. It might appear that there is no place for simple weather wisdom, but this is incorrect. Human experience remains the essential component that transforms computational data into weather forecasts, and human observations can still yield unusual evidence that aids professionals in deciphering atmospheric enigmas.","Clutter: At times, irrespective of the quantity of possessions one accrues, a sense of security may remain elusive. While it is reasonable to harbor a fundamental nesting instinct and cultivate a domicile that satisfies one's necessities, there exists a juncture wherein the impetus for acquisition becomes unmanageable. Moreover, modern advertising is deliberately engineered to exploit our insecurities, with the pervasive subtext that omitting certain products renders one inferior. To ascertain the extent of your susceptibility, I exhort you to eschew perusing any advertising billboards on your subsequent urban traversal. These multimillion-dollar communications incessantly and persuasively condition us sans our cognizance. We are assailed by them—through television, radio, periodicals, magazines, posters, attire, the internet, inter alia—all exhorting us to procure incessantly. Caves: Research institutions and academic departments worldwide have allocated years of investigative endeavor to facets of speleology, predominantly their genesis, hydrology, and biology. Caves constitute a minor yet rather enigmatic component of the natural milieu, thereby inciting our inquisitiveness and challenging our epistemic aspirations, consequently attracting substantial research dedication. Furthermore, owing to their existence as natural phenomena, they have been subject to protracted scholarly examination, which has been intensified in locales where caves exert a direct impact on human modus vivendi. However, the physical dexterity requisite for accessing numerous caves implies that speleological research has been less the purview of erudite academics than in most other scientific domains; indeed, there is a considerable, perhaps singular, confluence between professional scientific scrutiny and amateur investigations undertaken by those who primarily engage in caving for sport. Weather Watch: Innumerable observant individuals, devoid of instrumentation beyond their own faculties, originally established the foundations of meteorology, which has progressed since the 17th century into the contemporaneous highly technical science. Satellites and electronic apparatus relay incessant meteorological intelligence with minimal latency, while computers resolve recondite mathematical computations at velocities exceeding human cerebral capacity. Meteorological theory is imbued with arcane lexicon that holds scant significance for the layperson. It may occasionally seem that no scope remains for elemental weather sagacity, yet this is profoundly erroneous. Human experience persists as the vital constituent that transmutes computational data into meteorological prognoses, and anthropogenic observations can still furnish anomalous evidence that substantially assists professionals in elucidating the mysteries of the atmosphere.","Clutter

Sometimes it seems that no matter how many possessions you have, you never feel secure. While it is reasonable to have a basic nesting instinct and create a home which meets your needs, there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Modern advertising is moreover deliberately designed to play on our insecurities.If you don't have one of these you will be a lesser human being is one of the consistent underlying messages we receive. To discover just how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street. These multi-million dollar messages relentlessly condition us in very persuasive ways without our ever realising it. We are bombarded by them - television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, tee shirts, the internet, you name it - all encouraging us to buy, buy, buy.

Caves

Research establishments and university departments around the world have invested years of research time in all aspects of caves, mainly their origins, their hydrology and their biology. Caves constitute a small but rather mysterious component of the natural environment - as such they arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge, and consequently have had a considerable amount of research effort devoted to them. Furthermore, because of their presence as natural phenomena, they have had a long history of study, which has been intensified in those parts of the world where caves have had a direct effect on our way of life. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields. Indeed there is a considerable, perhaps unique, overlap between the professional, scientific study of caves and the amateur studies carried out by those who mainly visit caves for sport.

Weather Watch

Countless observant people without any instruments other than their own senses originally laid the foundations of meteorology, which has progressed since the 17th century into the highly technical science of today. Satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us with the minimum of delay, computers solve in minutes abstruse mathematical sums at a speed beyond the capability of the human brain. Meteorological theory is peppered with long words which have little meaning to the non-professional. It sometimes seems there is no room left for simple weather wisdom, but nothing could be further from the truth. Human experience is still the vital ingredient which translates computed data into weather forecasts. Human observations can still provide unusual evidence which is of great help to professionals who are trying to unravel the mysteries of the atmosphere."
267,"Art

In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique, revolutionary, shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. But when we get to the art of our own day, we get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far, that what he does can no longer be called art. Or, rather, the media say it for us. And, on the whole, we agree because we expect to be puzzled by art's insistent newness - so much so that we do not notice the old themes, methods and also virtues that the art of our own time is full of.
We require artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive, so vigorous that conventions cannot contain them. Previous ages went to artists with commissions: people needed art for specific purposes, and it was part of their ordinary life. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

Picture This

I am going to describe a situation, and then ask a crucial question about it. I hope it doesn't strike you as unduly gnomic. But if it does, that's modern art for you.
Here's the situation. An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book. The text considers the diversity of pictures. 'What are they all about?' it asks dumbly, before deciding, even more dumbly: 'There is no end, in fact, to the number of different kinds of pictures.' Okay, this is kiddy-language, and so far all it has betrayed is kiddy-thinking. But stick with me, all you adults out there. The situation is about to complicate itself.
Having settled on his text, the man then asks someone else to make a canvas for him, to stretch it and prime it, and then to take it along to a sign painter. He asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. And he gives the sign painter specific instructions not to attempt anything flashy or charming with the lettering. The sign painter does all this. On a white canvas, in simple black letters, he writes the chosen text. So my crucial question is this: is the finished product a painting?

Underground Encounters

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

It is an unspoken rule of commercial success as a painter that once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam, and attempts to strike out in a new direction are usually met at best with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.
Why this should be I'm not entirely sure. Gallery owners obviously prefer safe bets, and perhaps the art-buying public is insecure and needs the comfort of continuity. A few artists break the mould and get away with it. Picasso and Hockney are two prime examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now gamely running contrary to form, and it remains to be seen if he can pull it off. His new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground.
Railways hold a peculiar charm for Rimmington. From drawings made in the 1980s of the railway land of Londons Kings Cross Station, it was a logical step to go beneath the ground and look at what was happening below. The sketches have provided the material for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings which convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.

Extract from a novel

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I do not know why I use the word 'escape'. The villagers say jokingly that only a sick man would choose such a remote place to rebuild. Well then, I have come here to heal myself, if you like to put it that way.
Apart from the wrinkled old peasant who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke of the uselessness of art but added nothing truthful about its consolations. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side. Our common actions in reality are simply the sackcloth covering which hides the cloth-of-gold - the meaning of the pattern. For us artists there waits the joyous compromise through art with all that wounded or defeated us in daily life; in this way, not to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination. Otherwise why should we hurt one another?",C2,"Art. Today, people say artists must be different. They must make new and surprising art. We like artists from the past who were not liked then. But now, we are scared of new art. We say it is not art. The news says this, and we agree. We think art must be new and strange. We do not see the old ideas in new art. We think artists are special people. They are not like us. Long ago, people asked artists to make art for them. Art was part of life. Now, artists make what they want. We get angry if they are not special. Picture This. I will tell you a story. An artist picks words from a book. The words talk about pictures. The artist asks someone to make a canvas. Then, a sign painter writes the words on the canvas. The letters are simple and black. Is this a painting? Underground Encounters. At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26. To be a successful painter, you must make the same kind of art. People who buy art want the same thing. If an artist changes, people get angry. Gallery owners like safe art. Some artists change and are successful. Picasso and Hockney did this. Eric Rimmington is changing now. He made still life art before. Now he paints the London Underground. He likes railways. He drew Kings Cross Station in the 1980s. Now he paints the underground. His show has 40 paintings and drawings. They show the magic of the underground world. Extract from a novel. I am on an island with some books. I do not know why I say 'escape'. People in the village joke that only a sick person comes here. So, I am here to get better. An old woman comes to clean the house. I am alone. I am not happy or sad. I think about the past. I said art is useless, but it can help. When I paint or write, I can change reality. I can show what is important. Normal life hides the meaning. Art helps artists deal with hard things in life. It is not to avoid life, but to live it fully. Why else do we hurt each other?","Art. In modern times, we often say that every artist must rebel against current art. We praise art that is unique, revolutionary, and even shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. But with today's art, we become nervous and say the artist has gone too far, and it should not be called art. The media say this, and we generally agree because we expect art to be new and confusing. Because of this, we miss the old themes and good qualities in modern art. We see artists as separate from ordinary people, with special talents and energy that break rules. In the past, people gave artists specific jobs to create art for everyday life. Now, we let artists do what they want and get annoyed if they act like normal people. Picture This. I will describe a situation and ask an important question. I hope it is not too mysterious. An artist selects a text from an art book. The text discusses the variety of pictures and asks what they are about, then says there are many kinds. The artist then has someone prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter writes the text on the canvas in simple black letters, without any fancy style. My question is: is this finished product a painting? Underground Encounters. At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th. For a painter to be commercially successful, there is an unspoken rule: once you find a popular style, you should keep using it. Collectors expect artists to continue in the same way, and if they try something new, people often feel let down and angry. I am not sure why this happens. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and the public might need consistency. A few artists change their style successfully, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different. His new exhibition replaces his famous still lifes with paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington has always been fascinated by railways. Starting with drawings of Kings Cross Station in the 1980s, he moved underground to explore that world. His sketches led to Underground Encounters, a show with 40 paintings and drawings that capture the strange magic of this underground place for travelers. Extract from a novel. I have come to this island with a few books. I am not sure why I use the word 'escape'. The villagers joke that only someone unwell would choose such a remote place to rebuild. So, you could say I am here to heal. Except for an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean, I am alone. I am not happy or unhappy; I feel stuck in memories. I mentioned that art is useless but did not talk about how it comforts. The comfort in my work as a painter or writer is that only in those quiet moments can I rearrange reality to show its important side. Everyday actions hide the true meaning, like rough cloth covering something valuable. For artists, art offers a happy way to deal with what hurts or defeats us in life. It is not about avoiding fate, as ordinary people do, but about fulfilling it through imagination. Otherwise, why do we cause pain to each other?","Art. In recent centuries, it has become common to speak as if every artist must rebel against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We take pleasure in admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we become hesitant and claim that the artist has gone too far, and it should not be considered art. The media express this view, and we generally agree because we anticipate being confused by art's constant novelty. As a result, we overlook the traditional themes, techniques, and virtues that are present in today's art. We expect artists to be distinct from ordinary people, possessing exceptional talents and drive that allow them to break conventions. In earlier periods, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, integrating art into daily life. Nowadays, we leave artists to their own creative processes and become irritated if they do not remain elevated and special. Picture This. I am going to describe a scenario and then pose a critical question. I hope it does not seem overly cryptic. An artist chooses a passage from an art book. The text reflects on the diversity of pictures, naively asking what they are about before concluding that there is no limit to the types of pictures. The artist then has another person prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. The sign painter is instructed to write the text on the canvas in plain black letters, without any decorative touches. After this is done, my essential question is: is the resulting object a painting? Underground Encounters. At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th. There is an unspoken rule for commercial success in painting: once an artist develops a profitable style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to consistently work in the same vein, and attempts to explore new directions are often met with disappointment and a sense of betrayal. The reasons for this are unclear; gallery owners likely prefer reliable investments, and the art-buying public may desire continuity for reassurance. Some artists successfully break this pattern, such as Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now boldly diverging from his usual form, and it is uncertain if he will succeed. His new exhibition daringly replaces his acclaimed still lifes with paintings depicting the London Underground. Rimmington has a particular fascination with railways.

Apart from the wrinkled old peasant who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke of the uselessness of art but added nothing truthful about its consolations. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side. Our common actions in reality are simply the sackcloth covering which hides the cloth-of-gold - the meaning of the pattern. For us artists there waits the joyous compromise through art with all that wounded or defeated us in daily life; in this way, not to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination. Otherwise why should we hurt one another?"
268,"Garbage in, garbage out

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be.

Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals, rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip.
To economists, this ceremony is peculiar, because in most places it is free. Yes, households pay for the service out of local taxes but the family that fills four bins with rubbish each week pays no more than the elderly couple that fills one.
Yet the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero at all. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more the local authorities have to pay in landfill and tipping fees. This looks like the most basic of economic problems: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish.
The obvious solution is to make households pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. That will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more (assuming that local governments provide collection points for suitable materials).
But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, have found, what appears to be the logical approach to an everyday problem has surprisingly intricate and sometimes disappointing results.
Research focused on several American towns and cities which, in the past few years, have started charging households for generating rubbish. The commonest system is to sell stickers or tags which householders attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up in the weekly collection. 
In a paper published last year Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman concentrated on the effects of one such scheme, introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may sound like sensible use of market forces. In fact, the authors conclude, the schemes benefits did not cover the cost of printing materials, the commissions to sellers and the wages of the people running the scheme.
True, the number of bags or cans did fall sharply, by 37%. But this was largely thanks to the 'Seattle stomp', a frantic dance first noticed when that distant city introduced rubbish pricing. Rather than buy more tags, people simply crammed more garbage - about 40% more -- into each container by jumping on it if necessary.
As we all know, such compacting is done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals, however enthusiastically. The weight of rubbish collected (a better indicator of disposal costs than volume) fell by a modest 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities where no pricing scheme was in place, and which were used as a rough-and-ready control group, it fell by 3.5% in any case.
Less pleasing still, some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay to have their rubbish removed. This is hard to measure directly but the authors guess that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish.
The one bright spot in the whole experience seems to have been a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) rather than pay to have their refuse carted away. But the fee may have little to do with the growth in recycling, as many citizens were already participating in Charlottesville's voluntary scheme.
In a more recent study, Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman explore the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion from this broader study is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish - but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts quantity only by 0.3%.
This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns, but is it so surprising? To reduce their output of rubbish by a lot, people would have to buy less of just about everything. A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference.
If that's the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw out more rubbish than in poorer ones and they have less time for recycling.
Should we conclude that the idea of charging households for the rubbish they produce is daft? Not at all: free disposal after all is surely too cheap. But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.",C2,"Some cities ask families to pay for each bag of rubbish. This seems good for the environment and money. But it may not be good. In one city, people paid 80 cents for each bag. The number of bags went down a lot. But people put more rubbish in each bag. They jumped on the bags to make them smaller. The weight of rubbish went down only a little. Some people threw rubbish in illegal places. Recycling went up a little. But paying for rubbish may not change how much people throw away. It is a difficult problem.","Charging families for each bag of rubbish seems like a good idea for the environment and saving money. But research shows it may not work well. In one American town, people paid 80 cents per bag. The number of bags dropped by 37%, but people put about 40% more rubbish in each bag by compacting it. The weight of rubbish only fell by 14%. Some people started illegal dumping to avoid paying. Recycling increased by 15%, but this might not be because of the fee. Studies found that higher prices only reduce rubbish weight a little. Other things like income and education also affect how much rubbish people produce. So, charging for rubbish is complex and not always effective.","Charging households for each bag of rubbish appears environmentally and economically sensible, but research indicates it may not be effective. In Charlottesville, Virginia, residents paid 80 cents per bag, leading to a 37% decrease in bag numbers. However, people compressed more rubbish into each bag, reducing the weight by only 14%. Illegal dumping increased, accounting for an estimated 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. Recycling rose by 15%, though this may not be directly due to the fee. Broader studies show that a 10% price increase reduces rubbish weight by just 0.3%, as people are unlikely to change buying habits significantly. Factors like income and education also influence rubbish production, suggesting that charging schemes are complex and often yield disappointing results.","Imposing charges on households for each bag of rubbish seems logically sound from environmental and economic perspectives, yet empirical evidence reveals limitations. In Charlottesville, Virginia, a scheme where residents paid 80 cents per bag resulted in a 37% reduction in bag numbers, but this was largely due to increased compaction, with rubbish weight falling by only 14%. Illegal dumping emerged, potentially responsible for 30-40% of the decrease in collected waste. Recycling increased by 15%, though participation in voluntary programs may have contributed. Extensive research indicates that price elasticity is low; a 10% price rise reduces rubbish weight by merely 0.3%. Additional factors such as income and education significantly affect waste generation, implying that simplistic pricing policies are inadequate and require sophisticated economic analysis to address the complexities effectively.","While charging households for rubbish disposal appears environmentally prudent and economically rational, investigations demonstrate that such measures often yield intricate and suboptimal outcomes. In Charlottesville, Virginia, the implementation of an 80-cent per bag fee led to a 37% decline in bag quantities, but this was predominantly attributable to enhanced compaction efforts, resulting in a mere 14% reduction in weight—a more accurate cost indicator. Concurrently, illicit dumping accounted for an estimated 30-40% of the diminished waste collection. Recycling experienced a 15% uptick, though this may not be directly correlated with the fee, given pre-existing voluntary schemes. Broader analyses reveal that price increases have minimal impact; a 10% hike in charges reduces waste weight by only 0.3%, as behavioural changes are insufficient to alter consumption patterns substantially. Consequently, factors like socioeconomic status and education exert considerable influence, necessitating complex economic models to devise effective waste management strategies that transcend simplistic pricing mechanisms.","Garbage in, garbage out

269,"MUSIC AND THEATRE

Up until quite recently, I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house, I learned that opera is, in fact, only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That's as it should be, of course. But I come from a different world, the world of the theatre, where the word and the actor speaking it have primacy, where there is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way, and where performer and audience (mostly) speak the same language.
At any musical performance, whether in concert hall or opera house, there will generally be a substantial minority of people who, like me, have little technical or academic understanding of music. Some of them will be aware of, possibly even embarrassed by, how much they don't know. Most will be awestruck by the skill of the performers. A dazzling coloratura or an impeccable string section are easy to admire. Even a moderately good musician is showing us the results of years of punishingly hard work. Being in the audience for top-class music is not unlike watching an athletics match - we know athletes are doing something broadly similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also recognise by how much it excess our best efforts.
Theatre audiences by contrast, come with a different set of expectations. In the main they do not understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually impressed when an actor completes a long and difficult speech (although 'how do you learn all those lines?' is the question every actor gets asked). None of this means that theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall, indeed quite a lot of them are the same people. What perhaps it does mean is that audiences and performer meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event. The question is, does music need to learn anything from the theatre about this relationship? I would say yes, partly because I have seen how a different approach can transform the concert-goers experience.
Music in live performance is inherently theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, vulnerable to the possibility that something will go unexpectedly wrong, reaching into the imagination of the listener not just as an individual but as part of a collective. The conventions which still largely dominate music presentation, including strict dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasise the difference between players and listeners in a way which often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. On the other hand, the tendency of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a canicular piece of virtuosity, while it is often a spontaneous expression of appreciation, can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the whole work.
Is there anything to be done? Of course a huge amount is being done. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the staging of Jonathan Dove's community opera In Search of Angels, which followed the action from location to location within a cathedral and then out into the town. It was a musical experience of the highest order, in which the skills, and the generosity, of the professional musicians were absolutely central and it was also life-changing for many of the audience, who were not just there to see and hear but also to contribute directly.
Perhaps what I yearn for in music is a bit more of the risk and radicalism that theatre at its best can display. Sometimes it can come from the use of unfamiliar or challenging locations, where normal expectations are disrupted. This can have startling effects on performer and audience alike. Comforts may have to be foregone, perhaps the acoustic isn't great, maybe it's a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be intrepid as they follow artists into the most unpromising spaces. I accept that most plays get put on in a pretty uncontroversial way, not greatly different from what happens in a conmen hall. However I remain convinced that something can and should happen to change the conventions of music-going. The only authority I can claim is that of the enthusiast: I love, and live by, the theatre and I spend as much time (and money) as I can going to hear music. I want them both to thrive, and for more and more people to get the pleasure I get from being the audience. ",C2,"I thought opera was mainly theatre. But after working at an opera house, I learned that music is more important. I come from the theatre world. In theatre, words and actors are most important. The audience and actors speak the same language. At music shows, many people do not know much about music. They admire the performers' skills. It is like watching athletes who are much better than us. In theatre, audiences are not as impressed by actors. They think they could do it too. But theatre audiences and performers are more equal. Music can learn from theatre. Live music is full of feelings and can be risky. The rules for music shows make performers and audiences feel different. Sometimes, audiences clap at the wrong time. People are working to make music more open. I saw a community opera that changed lives. I want music to be more like theatre, with more risk. I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them.","I used to believe that opera was primarily theatre. However, after a short time working at a national opera house, I discovered that music is actually the main focus. I come from the theatre world, where words and actors are most important, and there is no director during the performance. Also, performers and audiences usually speak the same language. At musical performances, many people have little technical knowledge of music. They often feel amazed by the performers' skills, such as a great singer or a perfect group of musicians. This is similar to watching athletes who do things much better than we can. In contrast, theatre audiences do not always understand actors' skills and may not be very impressed, thinking they could do it themselves. This does not mean theatre audiences are kinder; they are often the same people as music audiences. But in theatre, audiences and performers meet more equally. Music could learn from this relationship. Live music is theatrical, with emotions like passion and sadness, and it can have unexpected problems. Traditional music rules, like strict dress codes, create a hierarchy between players and listeners. Sometimes, audiences applaud at inappropriate times, which can disrupt the performance. Efforts are being made to attract new audiences and break down barriers. For example, I saw a community opera that moved around a cathedral and town, offering a life-changing experience. I wish music had more risk and innovation, like theatre, using unusual places to surprise everyone. Although most plays are performed conventionally, I believe music conventions should change. As an enthusiast, I love both theatre and music and want more people to enjoy them.","Until recently, I considered opera to be primarily theatre. But after a brief period working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the most important element. I originate from the theatre world, where the spoken word and the actor hold the highest importance, there is no director controlling the action during the performance, and performers and audiences generally share the same language. At musical events, whether in concert halls or opera houses, a significant number of people, like me, have limited technical or academic understanding of music. Some may feel aware or even embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are awestruck by the performers' abilities, such as a dazzling singer or an impeccable string section. Even average musicians demonstrate years of hard work. Attending a top-class music performance is comparable to watching athletics; we recognize that athletes excel far beyond our own capabilities. In theatre, audiences have different expectations. They often do not grasp the skill involved in acting and are not particularly impressed by something that seems similar to what they could do. For instance, completing a long speech does not usually amaze them, though actors are often asked how they memorize lines. This does not imply that theatre audiences are more generous; in fact, many are the same people who attend concerts. However, it suggests that in theatre, audiences and performers interact on more equal terms, regardless of the material's difficulty. Music could benefit from learning about this relationship. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humour, and melancholy, and it is vulnerable to unexpected issues, engaging listeners both individually and collectively. Conventional music presentations, with strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists, often create an uncomfortable hierarchy. Conversely, modern audiences sometimes applaud between movements or after impressive solos, which, while appreciative, can harm the work's dramatic flow. There are ongoing efforts to attract new audiences and reduce barriers, such as community operas that involve the audience directly. I recall a transformative production of Jonathan Dove's community opera that moved through a cathedral and town, highlighting professional musicians' generosity. I desire more risk and innovation in music, similar to theatre, by using challenging locations to disrupt norms. Although most theatrical productions are conventional, I am convinced that music conventions should evolve. As an enthusiast who loves and supports both arts, I want them to thrive and bring pleasure to more people.","I would have asserted until quite recently that opera is fundamentally theatre, but no longer. After a short stint working at a national opera house, I came to understand that opera is, in fact, secondary to music. This is as it should be, yet my background is in the theatre world, where primacy is given to the word and the actor delivering it, where no one directs the action once the performance begins, and where performer and audience typically communicate in the same language. At any musical performance, a substantial minority of attendees possess little technical or academic comprehension of music. Some are conscious of their ignorance and may feel embarrassed, while the majority are filled with awe at the performers' expertise. A brilliant coloratura or a flawless string section is readily admirable, and even moderately skilled musicians reveal the outcomes of years of arduous work. Observing elite music is not unlike watching an athletics competition; we acknowledge that athletes are performing activities akin to our own, such as running for a bus, but we also recognize the vast superiority of their efforts. In contrast, theatre audiences arrive with divergent expectations. Generally, they do not apprehend the nature of acting skill and are not particularly awed by an activity that often appears within their own capabilities. They are seldom impressed when an actor executes a lengthy and complex speech, despite the common inquiry about line memorization. This does not mean theatre audiences are more lenient or less exacting than those in concert halls; indeed, many individuals frequent both. What it may signify is that in theatre, audiences and performers engage on a more equitable footing, irrespective of the material's challenge or the event's spectacle. The question arises: can music glean insights from theatre regarding this dynamic? I believe so, partly because I have witnessed how an alternative approach can enhance the concert-goer's experience. Live music is inherently theatrical, imbued with passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, and grandeur, and it is susceptible to unforeseen mishaps, engaging the listener's imagination both individually and collectively. The conventions that still predominate in music presentation, including rigid dress codes and exaggerated deference to conductors and soloists, accentuate the distinction between performers and listeners in a manner that often feels hierarchically uncomfortable. Conversely, the propensity of contemporary audiences to interrupt performances by applauding between movements or after a virtuosic passage, while often a spontaneous expression of appreciation, can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the entire work. Is there a remedy? Certainly, extensive efforts are underway nationwide to entice new audiences into concert halls and opera houses and to dismantle barriers that deter people from 'serious' music. I recall a remarkable production of Jonathan Dove's community opera, In Search of Angels, which progressed through various locations in a cathedral and into the town, offering a supreme musical experience centered on professional musicians' skill and generosity, and it proved transformative for many audience members who actively participated. Perhaps what I crave in music is a greater infusion of the risk and radicalism that characterizes theatre at its best. This can emanate from employing unconventional or challenging venues that disrupt normal expectations, affecting both performers and audiences profoundly. Comforts might be sacrificed, acoustics may be suboptimal, or temperatures chilly, but theatre audiences have grown intrepid in pursuing artists into unlikely spaces. I concede that most plays are staged in a conventional manner, similar to concert halls, yet I remain persuaded that conventions of music attendance can and should be altered. My authority stems solely from enthusiasm: I adore and live by theatre, and I devote considerable time and resources to attending musical events. I desire both arts to flourish and for an increasing number of people to derive the pleasure I experience as an audience member.","Until quite recently, I would have contended that opera is preeminently theatre, but my perspective has shifted. Following a brief tenure at a national opera house, I ascertained that opera is, in actuality, only secondarily theatre, with music taking precedence—a rightful hierarchy. However, I hail from the theatrical domain, where the spoken word and the actor possess primacy, where no external director oversees the action once the event commences, and where performer and audience largely converse in a shared language. At musical performances, whether in concert halls or opera houses, there typically exists a substantial minority of individuals who, akin to myself, have scant technical or academic grasp of music. Some are cognizant of their deficiencies, potentially even discomfited by them, while the majority are awestruck by the performers' prowess. A dazzling coloratura or an impeccable string section is facile to admire, and even a moderately accomplished musician exhibits the fruits of years of grueling labor. Attending a top-tier musical performance is not dissimilar to observing an athletics match; we perceive that athletes are engaging in activities broadly analogous to our own, such as sprinting for a bus, yet we also discern the immense chasm that exceeds our utmost endeavors. Theatre audiences, by contrast, arrive with a disparate set of anticipations. Predominantly, they do not comprehend the essence of an actor's skill and are not particularly daunted by an endeavor that frequently appears proximate to their own capabilities. They are not customarily impressed when an actor delivers a protracted and arduous speech, notwithstanding the ubiquitous query regarding line memorization. None of this implies that theatre audiences are more magnanimous or less exigent than their counterparts in concert halls; indeed, a considerable number are identical individuals. What it perhaps denotes is that in the theatre, audiences and performers convene on more egalitarian terms, regardless of the material's complexity or the event's grandeur. The pertinent inquiry is whether music can assimilate any lessons from theatre concerning this rapport. I would affirm in the affirmative, partly because I have observed how a divergent methodology can transmute the concert-goer's experience. Music in live performance is inherently theatrical, replete with passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, and grandeur, vulnerable to the potentiality of unforeseen mishaps, and it engages the listener's imagination not merely as an individual but as part of a collective. The conventions that still largely govern music presentation, including stringent dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasize the dichotomy between performers and listeners in a manner that often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. On the other hand, the proclivity of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of a performance by applauding between movements or after a particularly virtuosic passage, while frequently a spontaneous manifestation of appreciation, can also be injudicious regarding the dramatic integrity of the entire composition. Is there any recourse? Undoubtedly, a prodigious amount of initiative is being undertaken. Pioneering endeavors are proliferating across the nation to encourage nascent audiences into concert halls and opera houses and to dismantle the barriers that engender the perception that 'serious' music is inaccessible. I recollect a remarkable occurrence: the staging of Jonathan Dove's community opera In Search of Angels, which traversed various locales within a cathedral and subsequently into the town. It constituted a musical experience of the highest caliber, wherein the expertise and magnanimity of the professional musicians were paramount, and it proved life-altering for numerous audience members, who were not merely passive spectators but active contributors. Perhaps what I yearn for in music is a more pronounced element of the risk and radicalism that theatre at its zenith can manifest. This can emanate from the utilization of unfamiliar or challenging venues, where conventional expectations are subverted, yielding startling effects on both performers and audiences. Comforts may necessitate relinquishment—perhaps the acoustics are inferior, or the environment is frigid—but theatre audiences have cultivated intrepidity as they accompany artists into the most unpromising spaces. I acknowledge that the majority of theatrical productions are mounted in a relatively uncontroversial fashion, not vastly dissimilar from what occurs in a concert hall. Nevertheless, I remain convinced that transformations can and should be effected to alter the conventions of music attendance. The sole authority I can profess is that of the enthusiast: I cherish and exist by the theatre, and I expend as much time and financial resources as feasible attending musical events. I aspire for both to prosper and for an ever-expanding populace to attain the gratification I derive from being part of the audience.","MUSIC AND THEATRE

270,"Air-conditioning

There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym, a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so, in fact, that at quiet times, the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. This is just one example of how the modern world casually misuses air-conditioning. It has become a central feature of work and play, a potent symbol of the ability of humanity to control the climate, or at least modify it.
Many air-conditioned buildings, however, could employ other methods of cooling. They could take advantage of daylight and natural ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and radiate it away at night. These measures may sound obvious, but they can have telling results and would considerably reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It is surely more than coincidence that the beginning of a new millennium is being accompanied by renewed interest in sundials: instruments used to measure time according to the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were a vital time-keeping device, essential for anyone who hoped to keep their clocks working accurately. Then, as clocks and watches became more sophisticated and reliable, the sundial was relegated to the status of garden ornament - a romantic and intriguing ornament, but nonetheless an anachronism, in a brave new technological age. Now the clock has been turned back and they are again being taken seriously.
David Harber, a sundial maker, believes that their appeal lies in their direct link with the planets. He says that when he delivers one, there is a moment of magic when it starts working. They are still, calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the cosmos.

Paint Your Own China

My image of china-painting stemmed from a visit, long ago, to an arts and crafts exhibition where stern-looking grey-haired ladies demonstrated how to cover a teacup with delicate flowers using a series of deft brushstrokes. The spectacle was riveting, because each stroke formed a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands never wobbled, the paint never smudged, and the observer might have concluded that these women had either been practising their art for decades or had been born with an extraordinary talent for steady precision.
Mindful of this experience, I wondered what kind of people would have the courage to enrol on a course in china-painting. Would even the beginners display an intuitive artistry? In fact, the atmosphere turned out to be far from intimidating. The students were all there to have fun and not even the tutor wanted to paint petals on teacups with the robotic rapidity I had remembered.",C2,"Air-conditioning: It is very cold at Cannons Gym. The gym uses too much air-conditioning because it is hot outside. This makes the gym feel like the Arctic. People use air-conditioning a lot today. It shows that people can control the weather. But many buildings can use other ways to stay cool. They can use daylight and open windows. They can have thick walls that keep heat out. This would mean less air-conditioning is needed. Sundials: Sundials are old tools that tell time using the sun. Long ago, people used them to know the time. Then, clocks became better, and sundials were just for gardens. Now, people like sundials again. A sundial maker says they are special because they connect to the planets. They are calm and remind us of the sky. Paint Your Own China: I saw ladies painting flowers on teacups at a show. They painted very well with no mistakes. It looked easy for them. I thought only experts could do this. But I went to a class for painting china. The students were there to have fun. The teacher did not paint fast like the ladies I saw.","Air-conditioning: At Cannons Gym, it is very cold because they use too much air-conditioning during the hot summer. This is an example of how people often use air-conditioning without thinking. Air-conditioning is common in work and fun places, showing that humans can change the climate. However, many buildings could use other methods to stay cool. For example, they could use natural light and air flow, and have thick walls that do not get hot easily. These simple ideas can reduce the need for air-conditioning a lot. Sundials: There is new interest in sundials as the new millennium starts. Sundials measure time by the sun's position. A century ago, they were important for keeping clocks accurate. When clocks improved, sundials became just decorations in gardens. Now, people are taking them seriously again. A sundial maker, David Harber, says sundials are appealing because they link directly to the planets. He finds it magical when a sundial starts working. They are peaceful objects that make us think about our place in the universe. Paint Your Own China: My idea of china-painting came from seeing older women paint flowers on teacups at an exhibition. They painted perfectly with steady hands, and it seemed they had great skill from years of practice. Because of this, I wondered who would be brave enough to take a china-painting course. I thought beginners might not be good at it. But the class was not scary; everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not paint as quickly as I remembered.","Air-conditioning: Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, is excessively cold due to overuse of air-conditioning during this summer's high temperatures. At quiet times, it feels almost Arctic. This illustrates how air-conditioning is often misused in the modern world, becoming a key part of daily life and a symbol of humanity's ability to control the climate. Nevertheless, many air-conditioned buildings could adopt alternative cooling methods. They might utilise daylight and natural ventilation, or have thicker walls that absorb less heat by day and release it at night. Although these measures seem obvious, they can be highly effective and would significantly cut down on air-conditioning requirements. Sundials: It is likely no coincidence that the start of the new millennium has sparked renewed interest in sundials, which are instruments for telling time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were essential for accurate timekeeping, but as clocks and watches became more advanced, sundials were reduced to decorative garden items. Now, they are being taken seriously again. According to sundial maker David Harber, their charm comes from their direct connection to the planets. He describes a magical moment when a sundial begins to function, noting that they are serene, romantic objects that remind us of our cosmic place. Paint Your Own China: My perception of china-painting originated from an arts and crafts exhibition where elderly women demonstrated painting delicate flowers on teacups with precise brushstrokes. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, leading me to believe they possessed either decades of experience or innate talent. With this in mind, I questioned what type of person would enroll in a china-painting course and whether beginners would show natural artistry. In reality, the atmosphere was far from intimidating; all students were present for enjoyment, and the tutor did not aim for the rapid, robotic painting I had recalled.","Air-conditioning: At Cannons Gym, a favoured lunch-time destination for City of London employees, there is an excessive chill in the air due to the overuse of air-conditioning to combat the summer's unusually high temperatures. During quiet periods, the gym evokes an Arctic-like environment. This serves as a prime example of the casual misuse of air-conditioning in contemporary society, where it has become integral to both work and leisure, symbolising humanity's capacity to manipulate the climate. However, numerous air-conditioned buildings could implement other cooling strategies, such as harnessing daylight and natural ventilation or constructing thicker walls that minimise heat absorption during the day and dissipate it at night. While these approaches may appear straightforward, they yield substantial benefits and would markedly diminish the dependence on air-conditioning. Sundials: The dawn of the new millennium coincides with a resurgence of interest in sundials, devices that measure time according to the sun's position. A century ago, they were indispensable for maintaining accurate clocks, but with the advent of more sophisticated timepieces, sundials were demoted to mere garden ornaments—charming yet anachronistic in a technologically advanced era. Presently, their significance is being restored. David Harber, a sundial craftsman, contends that their appeal stems from their direct planetary linkage. He recounts a magical instant when a sundial becomes operational, describing them as tranquil, romantic artefacts that prompt reflection on our position in the cosmos. Paint Your Own China: My conception of china-painting was shaped by an early visit to an arts and crafts exhibition, where stern, grey-haired women adeptly adorned teacups with delicate floral patterns through a series of deft brushstrokes. The spectacle was captivating, as each stroke produced flawless petals or leaves without any tremor or smudging, suggesting either prolonged practice or inherent precision. Considering this, I pondered who would have the courage to enroll in a china-painting course and if novices would exhibit intuitive artistry. In fact, the environment proved far from daunting; all participants were engaged for pleasure, and even the instructor eschewed the robotic rapidity I had associated with the craft.","Air-conditioning: A distinct chill pervades Cannons Gym, a preferred lunch-time retreat for City of London workers, owing to an overzealous application of air-conditioning in response to this summer's anomalously high temperatures. Indeed, during lulls, the fitness centre assumes an almost Arctic ambiance. This epitomises the modern world's nonchalant misuse of air-conditioning, which has evolved into a central facet of professional and recreational life, serving as a potent emblem of humanity's prowess in climate control or modification. Nonetheless, a multitude of air-conditioned edifices could employ alternative cooling methodologies, such as capitalising on daylight and natural ventilation or incorporating thicker walls that exhibit reduced diurnal heat absorption and nocturnal radiation. These measures, while seemingly evident, can produce significant outcomes and would substantially curtail the necessity for air-conditioning. Sundials: It is scarcely coincidental that the inception of a new millennium is paralleled by a revived fascination with sundials: instruments utilised to gauge temporal passage based on solar positioning. A century prior, they constituted a vital chronometric apparatus, essential for ensuring horological accuracy. Subsequently, as clocks and watches grew more refined and dependable, sundials were relegated to the status of horticultural adornments—romantic and intriguing yet anachronistic in a technologically audacious epoch. Presently, this trend has reversed, and they are once again being regarded with seriousness. David Harber, an artisan of sundials, posits that their allure resides in their direct cosmic connection. He avers that upon delivery, a moment of enchantment occurs when the sundial commences operation, characterising them as serene, romantic objects that evoke contemplation of our cosmic station. Paint Your Own China: My imagery of china-painting derived from a long-past visit to an arts and crafts exhibition, where austere, grey-haired ladies demonstrated the application of delicate floral motifs to teacups via a sequence of adroit brushstrokes. The spectacle was riveting, for each stroke culminated in an impeccable petal or leaf, their hands unwavering and the paint unsullied, leading an observer to infer either decades of artistic practice or an innate talent for meticulous precision. Mindful of this experience, I speculated about the individuals who would possess the fortitude to enrol in a china-painting course and whether even novices would manifest an intuitive artistry. In actuality, the atmosphere proved far from intimidating; all students were present for diversion, and not even the tutor aspired to replicate the robotic celerity I had recollected.","Air-conditioning

There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym, a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so, in fact, that at quiet times, the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. This is just one example of how the modern world casually misuses air-conditioning. It has become a central feature of work and play, a potent symbol of the ability of humanity to control the climate, or at least modify it.
Many air-conditioned buildings, however, could employ other methods of cooling. They could take advantage of daylight and natural ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and radiate it away at night.

271,"The Lure of the Kitchen

When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is, on the face of it, an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long, pressured, menial - and badly paid.
But such considerations didn't put me off. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard;
the social scene was insular and self-important. Being a chef seemed the perfect antidote to intellectual and social posturing. It promised a seriousness and integrity lacking in my college life.
But my desire to cook was not simply a reaction to being a student. It also expressed an aesthetic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards.
After this, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretence, distracting me from my true course. I acquired my real education haphazardly and deficiently by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens and preparing extravagant meals.

Extract from a novel

The school's swimming instructor was an ex-drill sergeant, small and muscle-bound, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pools edge, put my hands above my head and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet. I practised that manoeuvre until the hour was up. The next visit, he got me standing upright, and diving off the edge. The instructor was a martinet and every time I surfaced he looked at me with distaste: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed outrageously high as I stood there, trying to work up my courage. Gradually the echoing voices disappeared and I felt as if I were cocooned in silence. I waved my arms vaguely in the way I'd been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled ignominiously, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not diminish my euphoria. That's what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.

The Traveller

To those of us for whom a comfortable bed, running water and the probability of living at least until tomorrow are of prime importance, the phenomenon of the traveller appears as incomprehensible as it is intriguing. Here are people who have succumbed to the treacherous seduction of the unknown, who actually choose to put their lives at risk by climbing the sheer and icy face of an avalanche-ridden mountain; who sail alone in frail craft through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing more palatable is on offer and who can live, day and night for months on end, in the shadow and the promise of the unknown.
It is easy to dismiss such people as oddities - as indeed they are - to be relegated to the ranks of the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers or indeed writers. That they exist cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they occupy lies well outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as an irrelevancy. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answerphones, glad that the only risks to our own health are predictable ones such as making a suicidal dash across a city street.

SAILING

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his element, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is obviously a competent one. His overriding reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is guaranteed to provide alarms and achievements for his pen to celebrate.
Raban's little boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives mariners their position to within a few metres, anywhere on the earth's surface. Strongly as he approves of this instrument, there is more than a touch of primitivism in Raban's attitude to other sea-faring aids. He thinks the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a 'fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea'. Raban maintains that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main object of the steersman's gaze, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things going on in it, is now reduced to a mere space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long stretches by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves.",C2,"I wanted to be a chef when I was at university. This was a strange choice for my friends. Cooking was not a good job. Chefs work long hours and get little money. But I did not care. I was not happy at university. The work was hard, and the people were not nice. Being a chef seemed better. It was honest work. I also loved food. I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I wanted to learn to cook like that. I read cookbooks and cooked big meals instead of studying. The swimming teacher was a strict man with tattoos. He taught me to dive. First, I sat and rolled into the water. Then I stood and dived. He always told me what to do. I tried diving from a high board. I was scared, but I jumped. I did not dive well, but I felt very happy. Some people like to travel in dangerous ways. They climb high mountains or sail in small boats. They eat strange food and live with risks. Most people think they are odd. We prefer safe things like beds and phones. Jonathan Raban is a writer who sails. He is afraid of the sea but sails to write about it. He uses a device to know where he is. He does not like the compass because it makes sailors not watch the sea. He thinks the sea is now just a space. He had time to look at the waves.","When I was at university, I decided to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Cooking was not a popular or well-paid job. Chefs have hard lives with long hours and low pay. But this did not stop me. I was unhappy at university because the work was difficult and the social life was not good. Being a chef seemed like a honest job without pretending. It was also about beauty in food. I remember eating at a famous London restaurant. The meal was a wonderful experience. After that, I wanted to learn the secrets of cooking. I focused on cooking instead of my studies. I read cookbooks, visited markets, and made fancy meals. The swimming instructor was a strict ex-sergeant with tattoos. He taught me to dive step by step. First, I practiced rolling off the edge. Then I learned to dive standing up. He was very strict and gave many orders. Later, I tried diving from a high board. I was nervous, but I jumped and felt like I was flying. My dive was not perfect, but I felt very happy. Some people choose to travel in risky ways, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone. They eat unusual foods and live with uncertainty. Most people see them as eccentric and prefer safe, comfortable lives with modern conveniences. Jonathan Raban is a writer who sails even though he fears the sea. He sails to have stories to write. He uses a GPS to find his position. He believes the compass was a bad invention because it made sailors stop watching the sea closely. Now, the sea seems empty, and autopilots can steer, so he had time to observe the waves.","During my time at university, I made the decision to pursue a career as a chef. This was an uncommon ambition among my peers, as cooking was not considered a desirable profession. Chefs are known for their tough working conditions, including long hours, high pressure, and low wages. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was dissatisfied with university life, finding the academic work challenging and the social environment pretentious. Becoming a chef appeared to be a genuine alternative, free from intellectual posturing. Additionally, it represented an aesthetic ideal. My inspiration came from a meal at a renowned London restaurant, which was a transformative experience. I developed a strong desire to master the art of cooking, so I devoted myself to reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals, often neglecting my formal studies. The swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular with tattooed arms. He taught me to dive by having me start with sitting rolls and progress to standing dives. He was a strict disciplinarian, constantly correcting my form. When I attempted a dive from the high board, I felt isolated and nervous but managed to jump, experiencing a brief sense of flight before an awkward entry into the water. Despite the instructor's disapproval, I felt euphoric. For most people, comfort and safety are priorities, so the behavior of adventurous travelers seems puzzling. These individuals embrace risks by climbing perilous mountains, sailing in fragile boats, and eating unconventional foods. They are often viewed as eccentrics, and while their existence is acknowledged, their lifestyle is dismissed as irrelevant by those who prefer the predictability of modern life. Jonathan Raban, a writer, admits to fearing the sea but sails to generate material for his writing. He is a capable sailor and uses electronic navigation aids, yet he criticizes the compass for altering the sailor's relationship with the sea. He argues that it has reduced the ocean to a mere space and allows for autopilots, giving him time to study the waves in detail.","While at university, I resolved to become a chef, a choice that was unconventional among my contemporaries. Cooking was not regarded as a prestigious occupation; indeed, chefs endure notoriously harsh existences characterized by prolonged hours, immense pressure, menial tasks, and inadequate compensation. Nevertheless, these drawbacks did not deter me. I felt discontented with university life, where the academic demands were arduous and the social milieu was insular and self-important. Culinary work offered an antidote to such intellectual and social affectations, promising a sense of seriousness and integrity. Moreover, my aspiration was driven by an aesthetic ideal, sparked by a revelatory meal at a famous London restaurant. That experience ignited an intense passion to unravel the secrets of cooking, leading me to transform my student years into a period of preparation. I neglected my history degree in favor of haphazardly educating myself through cookbooks, market visits, and the creation of extravagant dishes. The swimming instructor, an ex-drill sergeant with a muscular build and tattooed arms, methodically taught me to dive. Beginning with seated rolls, I advanced to standing dives under his martinet-like supervision, enduring his distasteful critiques. When I mounted the high diving board, I overcame my fear in a cocoon of silence and launched myself, briefly experiencing flight before a clumsy water entry. His contempt could not diminish my euphoria. The phenomenon of intrepid travelers is both incomprehensible and intriguing to those who prioritize comfort and safety. These individuals succumb to the seduction of the unknown, undertaking perilous endeavors such as scaling avalanche-prone mountains, sailing solo in frail vessels, and consuming unpalatable foods. They are often dismissed as oddities, relegated to the realm of the eccentric, yet their existence highlights a world beyond conventional experience. Most people gratefully retreat to the security of modern conveniences. Jonathan Raban, a writer, confesses a fear of the sea but sails to furnish material for his writing. Although he utilizes advanced navigation technology, he exhibits primitivist tendencies, decrying the compass for causing a fundamental rift in the human-sea relationship. He contends that it has reduced the ocean to a mere space and facilitated autopilots, thereby allowing him to meticulously observe the waves.","During my university years, I determined to embark upon a career as a chef, an aspiration that was decidedly unusual among my peers. Culinary professions were not considered plum jobs; on the contrary, chefs lead notoriously harsh lives replete with interminable hours, intense pressure, menial labor, and meager remuneration. However, such considerations failed to dissuade me, as I was profoundly disenchanted with the university environment, where the academic rigors were onerous and the social scene insular and self-important. Becoming a chef presented itself as the perfect antidote to intellectual and social posturing, proffering a seriousness and integrity that were absent from my collegiate existence. Yet, my desire to cook was not merely a reaction to student life; it also embodied an aesthetic ideal, initially apprehended during a meal at a celebrated London restaurant that proved revelatory. This experience engendered an intense yearning to uncover the secrets of that fabulous art, prompting me to transmute my student life into an extended preparation for my culinary ambitions.

He commenced with having me execute rolls from the pool's edge and progressed to upright dives, his martinet demeanor evident in his distasteful admonitions. Upon ascending the high board, I was enveloped in silence, mustered courage, and launched myself into space, briefly soaring before crumpling ignominiously upon impact. Despite his contempt, my euphoria remained undiminished. To those for whom comfort and security are paramount, the traveler phenomenon appears as incomprehensible as it is intriguing.

272,"Work

Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.

Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood, and even among individuals who have won eminence, there is often bitterness behind the fame. Loving your work, until recently, was enough to make you a member of an envied minority. But now you have to ask yourself what your job is doing to you as a person, to your mind, character and relationships.
This question is crucial. For however brilliant your skills, if they make you a bore, unable to converse with those outside your speciality, if you are so busy with detail that you have no time to acquire wisdom or exercise your imagination or humour, then no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this, I am trying to discover how work could have the fulfilment of these aspirations as its first priority - instead of treating us as clay to be moulded to suit industrial purposes - and how it could be reconceived to suit us all, both women and men. It would have to be not just a way of creating wealth, but a worthwhile style of life, a path to a fuller existence, to the discovery of unsuspected talents and to a wider variety of human contacts.
However, this remodelling would not mean abolishing unemployment. This is too simple a goal, because the more people are educated, the more they demand jobs that are life-enhancing, interesting and useful. A lifetime of work has to be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its centre.
Even the middle-class professions, however, no longer have the liberating appeal they once had. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients and complain about the failure of clinical medicine. Accountants, despite unprecedented influence, are troubled by doubts about their profession's ethics. Most architects never get the chance to exercise their imaginations freely. Administrators are paralysed by their own bureaucracy. The middle managers, who once gloried in their status, are, as a European study reveals, losing their conviction.
Meanwhile, the business corporations and public institutions in which these people work are slimming. The panaceas of decentralised decision-making, increasing skills and performance-related rewards have not succeeded in winning commitment from employees. In Britain, only 8 per cent of employees 'are strongly of the view that their values and those of their organisations are very similar'.
I have embarked on an investigation of a wide range of occupations, one by one, to see how each shapes and sometimes destroys those in it. I have studied how the notion of what humans are capable of has been expanded in different civilisations, and how courage can be manufactured.

Every time you have a conversation which achieves that, the world is changed by a minute amount.",C2,"Theodore Zeldin thinks about work. He asks if you feel good at your job. Many people are not happy with their work. They want more than just money. Work should help you be a better person. It should make you happy and help you meet people. But many jobs are boring or stressful. For example, hotel workers have low pay and long hours. Hotels could be fun places where people from different countries meet and talk. Work should be like making art. It should let you be yourself and talk to others.","Theodore Zeldin looks at how work could change. He asks if you feel respected in your job. Success in a career is not enough now. Many people are unhappy because their work does not make them feel good. Work should help you grow as a person, not just make money. It should allow you to use your imagination and have good relationships. But jobs like being a doctor or accountant can be stressful. In hotels, workers have low pay and do not use their full skills. Hotels could be places where people from around the world meet and learn from each other. Work should be a way to live a full life and have meaningful conversations.","Theodore Zeldin examines how our working lives might improve. He questions whether people feel properly valued in their careers. Simply having a successful job is no longer sufficient, as many professionals feel misunderstood or unappreciated. Work should prioritize personal fulfilment, helping individuals develop their minds, character, and relationships, rather than just serving industrial goals. However, jobs often fail to do this; for instance, middle-class professions like medicine or accounting cause stress and ethical doubts. In the hospitality industry, hotel workers endure low prestige and salaries, with untapped potential for cultural exchange. Zeldin argues that work should be rethought as a relationship, allowing people to design their jobs and engage in deep conversations that foster respect and personal growth.","Theodore Zeldin explores potential transformations in working life, questioning if individuals receive the respect and appreciation they merit. Career success alone is inadequate today, with widespread dissatisfaction across professions. Work ought to focus on personal fulfilment, enhancing one's intellect, character, and social connections, instead of moulding people for industrial efficiency. Yet, many occupations, such as those in medicine or administration, lead to stress and disillusionment. For example, hotel staff face poor conditions and unrealized opportunities; hotels could evolve into cultural hubs facilitating global interactions. Zeldin advocates redefining work from a human perspective, emphasizing it as a relationship that enables job customization and meaningful dialogue, which builds equality and transforms individuals through intimate exchanges.","Theodore Zeldin scrutinizes the evolution of work, probing whether individuals are accorded the esteem and recognition they warrant. Mere occupational achievement is insufficient in contemporary society, as vocations universally lament being undervalued, and even eminent figures often harbour bitterness. Work should be reconceived to prioritize the fulfilment of human aspirations—nurturing the mind, character, and interpersonal bonds—rather than treating employees as malleable entities for industrial objectives. Nonetheless, professions such as medicine and accounting are plagued by stress and ethical quandaries, while hotel workers exemplify squandered potential in an industry that could serve as a microcosm for global cultural exchange. Zeldin contends that work must be re-envisioned as a relational dynamic, permitting individuals to craft their roles and engage in profound conversations that foster mutual respect and personal metamorphosis, thereby enriching human existence.","Work

Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.

Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood, and even among individuals who have won eminence, there is often bitterness behind the fame. Loving your work, until recently, was enough to make you a member of an envied minority. But now you have to ask yourself what your job is doing to you as a person, to your mind, character and relationships.
This question is crucial. For however brilliant your skills, if they make you a bore, unable to converse with those outside your speciality, if you are so busy with detail that you have no time to acquire wisdom or exercise your imagination or humour, then no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this, I am trying to discover how work could have the fulfilment of these aspirations as its first priority - instead of treating us as clay to be moulded to suit industrial purposes - and how it could be reconceived to suit us all, both women and men. It would have to be not just a way of creating wealth, but a worthwhile style of life, a path to a fuller existence, to the discovery of unsuspected talents and to a wider variety of human contacts.
However, this remodelling would not mean abolishing unemployment. This is too simple a goal, because the more people are educated, the more they demand jobs that are life-enhancing, interesting and useful. A lifetime of work has to be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its centre.
Even the middle-class professions, however, no longer have the liberating appeal they once had. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients and complain about the failure of clinical medicine. Accountants, despite unprecedented influence, are troubled by doubts about their profession's ethics. Most architects never get the chance to exercise their imaginations freely. Administrators are paralysed by their own bureaucracy. The middle managers, who once gloried in their status, are, as a European study reveals, losing their conviction.
Meanwhile, the business corporations and public institutions in which these people work are slimming. The panaceas of decentralised decision-making, increasing skills and performance-related rewards have not succeeded in winning commitment from employees. In Britain, only 8 per cent of employees 'are strongly of the view that their values and those of their organisations are very similar'.
I have embarked on an investigation of a wide range of occupations, one by one, to see how each shapes and sometimes destroys those in it. I have studied how the notion of what humans are capable of has been expanded in different civilisations, and how courage can be manufactured. I have applied my method to the major preoccupations of our time - happiness, love, friendship and respect.
Having looked at those areas, I am now focusing on the search for more satisfying ways of earning a living. There is no shortage of experts devoting themselves to prolonging the life and increasing the income of corporations and institutions.

273,"Screen Learning

A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. 'I'm a little dinosaur,' he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme, so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not a lot.
There is a modish rush to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning via a screen a good method? One writer tells how he tried out an interactive programme with his son. The father diligently read the words while the son fiddled with the pictures. 'Had he spent ten minutes in front of a book, he might possibly have learned something,' said his father.
Television, as my son and his noodles demonstrate, is an impressionistic, suggestive medium. Research about television and learning shows that learning goes on in a learning environment where dialogue is taking place with teachers or parents. It needs to be mediated. There is nothing wrong with harnessing new technology to teach our children, but there is still a big role for formal education.

Hollywood

By 1918, four-fifths of the film-making capacity of the world had relocated to Hollywood. Locals disapproved, seeing their suburb of Los Angeles infected by these new vulgarians. But in the end snobbery yielded to the true American value, success. And success is the box-office gross. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: one that may make a star, but must make somebody's fortune.
In less than a century, Hollywood has grown from a toffee-nosed village to a town as famous as New York, Rome or Paris. And physically, of course, it has changed beyond recognition: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet in a way, it is still a village - parochial, with limited horizons - just a little bit of Los Angeles. For all who live and work in it, there is one topic of conversation - films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who's been stabbed in the back, who is 'attached' to which project. Those who have been successful often try to get away: to work there, but live somewhere else. Yet it is still the one place in the world to which almost everyone who is anyone in show-business (and plenty who agent) eventually gravitates.

Photography

Photography was invented by nineteenth century artists as an art form for their own purposes. These men were seeking a lasting, literal record of their visual surroundings and they found it. The new combination of illumination, lens, shutter, and flat surface coated with chemicals sensitive to light produced images more lasting, more convincing in their reality, and more richly detailed than painters could produce manually in weeks and months of effort. This alone was enough to throw consternation into the ranks of fellow artists; and, after their first reaction of pleasure in a new kind of image, art critics rallied with the haughty charge that photography was not, and could not be, an art. The actual world in which we live had too strong a grip on photography, they said, and pictures so dependent upon mechanical means could not be called acts of man's creative imagination.
Despite the critics, photographers knew that they had found a new art form, a new mode of expression. They used the new tools as other artists before and after them have used brush and pencil - to interpret the world, to present a vision of nature and its structure as well as the things and the people in it.

Book Illustration

During the black-and-white era of book illustration it was axiomatic that each and every children's book called for some form of illustration. This extended to the large category of novels for the upper reading ages, which was to suffer progressive attrition as print runs shortened. The level of activity in all areas of children's publishing remained considerable, but it was run predominantly as a low-budget operation for most of the period and as such encouraged a fair amount of routine and mediocre work, although the finest artists seldom submitted less than their professional best. Therefore, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house, a wonderful place for research or for browsing, and one in which to make immediate finds or to begin to re-evaluate a fertile artistic period. The real treasures are bound to return to public display, whether enduringly through reissues of individual titles and new publications about the artists who illustrated them - or from time to time in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after a period of neglect, this is starting to happen and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be seen to be at work. In due course, an enterprising publisher will doubtlessly see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period either in facsimile reprint, or in freshly-designed editions using the original artwork where it survives.
",C2,"Screen Learning: A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was acting like a dinosaur from a TV show. I asked him about dinosaurs, but he did not remember much. Some people think learning from screens is good, but one father said his son did not learn from a computer program. TV can teach children, but they need to talk with teachers or parents. Formal education is still important. Hollywood: By 1918, most movies were made in Hollywood. People there did not like it at first, but they accepted it because it was successful. Hollywood is now a famous town. It has changed a lot. People there talk about movies all the time. Many famous people go there to work. Photography: Artists in the 19th century invented photography to make pictures of the world. The pictures were very real and detailed. Other artists and critics said photography was not art because it used a machine. But photographers knew it was a new art form. They used it to show their view of the world. Book Illustration: In the past, children's books always had black-and-white pictures. Many books were made with low money, so some pictures were not very good, but good artists made good pictures. The old pictures are like a mix of bad and good things. People can find nice pictures in books or see them in shows again. Now, people are starting to show these pictures more.","Screen Learning: A few days ago, I noticed my six-year-old son eating noodles in a strange way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur from a TV show. When I asked him about dinosaurs, he did not remember much. There is a popular idea that learning from the internet and computers is good, but one writer tried a program with his son. The father read the words, but the son only played with pictures. The father thought his son would have learned more from a book. TV, as my son showed, gives ideas but does not teach well alone. Research says learning happens when children talk with teachers or parents. Using new technology is okay, but formal education is still very important. Hollywood: By 1918, about 80% of the world's film-making had moved to Hollywood. Local people did not approve at first, thinking it was low-class, but they accepted it because of success in making money. Hollywood has grown from a small village to a town as famous as New York or Paris. It has changed a lot physically; long ago, there were orange groves. But it is still like a village where people only talk about movies—how much money they make, who is dating, and who is working on what. Successful people often try to live elsewhere but work there. Many important people in show business go to Hollywood. Photography: In the 19th century, artists invented photography as an art form to create lasting records of what they saw. The images were more realistic and detailed than paintings. Other artists and critics were worried and said photography could not be art because it depended on machines and showed the real world too much. However, photographers believed it was a new way to express themselves. They used cameras like artists use brushes to interpret the world. Book Illustration: During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was common for every children's book to have pictures. This included novels for older children, but fewer were made over time. Children's publishing had a lot of activity, but it was often done with low budgets, leading to some average work, though the best artists always did their best. The collection of old illustrations is a mix of poor and excellent pieces, good for research or browsing. The best illustrations are likely to be shown again in reissued books or exhibitions. After being ignored, this is starting to happen, and people are rediscovering the art style. Soon, a publisher may make new books with these classic illustrations.","Screen Learning: A few days ago, I observed my six-year-old son eating noodles in an amusing manner. He was imitating a dinosaur from a recent TV program, saying he was a little dinosaur. I questioned him about what he recalled regarding dinosaurs, and he remembered very little. There is a fashionable trend to adopt internet and computer learning, but is learning through a screen effective? One writer described testing an interactive program with his son. The father carefully read the text while the son played with the images. The father commented that if his son had spent ten minutes with a book, he might have learned something. Television, as demonstrated by my son, is an impressionistic medium that suggests ideas rather than teaching directly. Research indicates that learning occurs in environments where there is dialogue with teachers or parents; it needs to be guided. There is no issue with using new technology to educate children, but formal education still plays a significant role. Hollywood: By 1918, four-fifths of the world's film production had moved to Hollywood. Local residents initially disapproved, viewing the newcomers as vulgar, but eventually, snobbery gave way to the American value of success, measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood recognizes a good film as one that can create stars and generate profits. In under a century, Hollywood has transformed from a snobbish village into a town as renowned as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed immensely; a century ago, one would walk through orange groves to reach the village store. However, in some ways, it remains a village with limited perspectives, focused solely on films—discussing revenues, relationships, betrayals, and project attachments. Those who achieve success often attempt to live elsewhere while working there. Yet, it remains the primary destination for nearly everyone important in show business. Photography: Photography was developed in the 19th century by artists seeking a durable, accurate record of their visual environment. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and light-sensitive chemicals produced images that were more permanent, realistic, and detailed than what painters could achieve manually over weeks or months. This caused concern among other artists, and after initial appreciation, critics argued that photography could not be considered art because it was too tied to the real world and mechanical processes, lacking human creativity. Despite this, photographers were confident they had discovered a new art form. They employed cameras as tools to interpret and present their vision of the world, similar to how artists use brushes or pencils. Book Illustration: In the era of black-and-white book illustration, it was universally accepted that every children's book required illustrations, including novels for older readers, though this category declined as print runs decreased. Children's publishing remained active, but it was largely a low-budget operation, resulting in a fair amount of ordinary work, although top artists consistently delivered high-quality illustrations. Consequently, the archive of black-and-white illustrations is a mixture of mediocre and exceptional items, ideal for research or casual exploration, where one can make quick discoveries or reassess a productive artistic period. The finest pieces are destined to reappear publicly, either through reissues of books or exhibitions of original works. After a period of neglect, this process is beginning, with stylistic reevaluation underway. Eventually, a proactive publisher will likely recognize the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations, reproduced as facsimiles or in new designs using original artwork.","Screen Learning: A few days ago, I noticed my six-year-old son consuming noodles in an peculiar fashion; he was pulling them up with his teeth while attempting to appear fierce, declaring, 'I'm a little dinosaur.'

In less than a century, Hollywood has evolved from a pretentious village into a town as iconic as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has transformed beyond recognition; a century prior, one would traverse orange groves to access the village store. Yet, in a sense, it remains a parochial village with confined horizons, merely a segment of Los Angeles where the sole topic of conversation revolves around films—their earnings, personal relationships, betrayals, and project affiliations. Those who attain success frequently endeavor to reside elsewhere while maintaining employment there.

Photography: Photography was invented in the nineteenth century by artists pursuing a lasting, literal record of their visual surroundings, which they achieved. The novel amalgamation of illumination, lens, shutter, and a chemically treated flat surface yielded images that were more enduring, convincingly realistic, and richly detailed than what painters could produce manually over weeks or months. This alone incited consternation among fellow artists; following an initial pleasure in the new imagery, art critics rallied with the haughty assertion that photography was not and could not be considered art. They contended that the actual world exerted too strong an influence on photography, and images so reliant on mechanical means could not be deemed products of human creative imagination.

Television, as exemplified by my son's conduct, is an impressionistic and suggestive medium.

Hollywood discerns a commendable film as one that may engender a star but must invariably amass pecuniary fortune. In under a century, Hollywood has metamorphosed from a toffee-nosed village into a municipality as illustrious as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has been transmuted beyond recognition; a century ago, one would amble through orange groves to attain the village emporium. Yet, in a manner, it remains a parochial village with circumscribed horizons—merely a fragment of Los Angeles. For all denizens and professionals within its confines, the singular topic of discourse is films: their fiscal yields, amorous affiliations, instances of perfidy, and project attachments. Those who have achieved eminence frequently strive to extricate themselves residentially, opting to labour there while domiciling elsewhere. Nevertheless, it endures as the preeminent global locus to which virtually every individual of consequence in show-business ultimately gravitates. Photography: Photography was conceived in the nineteenth century by artists as an art form for their own objectives, seeking a durable, literal chronicle of their visual milieu, which they accomplished. The innovative synthesis of illumination, lens, shutter, and a planar surface coated with photosensitive chemicals yielded images more permanent, more verisimilar in their actuality, and more intricately detailed than painters could manually produce across weeks and months of exertion. This alone sufficed to instil consternation amongst fellow artists; subsequent to their initial delectation in a novel imagery genre, art critics coalesced with the supercilious indictment that photography was not, and could not be, an art. They asserted that the tangible world in which we exist exerted an excessively potent influence on photography, and depictions so contingent upon mechanical apparatus could not be denominated as manifestations of humanity's creative imagination. In defiance of the critics, photographers were cognizant that they had uncovered a novel art form, a fresh modality of expression. They employed the new implements as other artists, antecedent and subsequent, have utilised brush and pencil—to interpret the cosmos, to proffer a vision of nature and its architecture, as well as the entities and personages therein. Book Illustration: During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was axiomatic that each and every children's tome mandated some form of illustration. This encompassed the extensive category of novels for superior reading ages, which was subjected to progressive attrition as print runs diminished. The degree of activity in all domains of children's publishing remained considerable, but it was administered predominantly as a low-budget operation for the majority of the period, thereby encouraging a fair quantum of routine and mediocre output, although the most accomplished artists infrequently submitted inferior to their professional optimum. Consequently, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house—a marvellous locale for scholarly inquiry or perusal, and one in which to effectuate immediate acquisitions or initiate the re-evaluation of a fecund artistic epoch. The authentic treasures are destined to revert to public exhibition, whether perpetually through reissues of individual titles and novel publications concerning the artists who illustrated them, or intermittently in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are indications that, following a period of neglect, this is commencing, and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be discerned in operation. In due course, an enterprising publisher will indubitably apprehend the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period, either in facsimile reprint or in freshly-conceived editions utilising the original artwork where it persists.","Screen Learning

They used the new tools as other artists before and after them have used brush and pencil - to interpret the world, to present a vision of nature and its structure as well as the things and the people in it.

Book Illustration

During the black-and-white era of book illustration it was axiomatic that each and every children's book called for some form of illustration. This extended to the large category of novels for the upper reading ages, which was to suffer progressive attrition as print runs shortened. The level of activity in all areas of children's publishing remained considerable, but it was run predominantly as a low-budget operation for most of the period and as such encouraged a fair amount of routine and mediocre work, although the finest artists seldom submitted less than their professional best. Therefore, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house, a wonderful place for research or for browsing, and one in which to make immediate finds or to begin to re-evaluate a fertile artistic period. The real treasures are bound to return to public display, whether enduringly through reissues of individual titles and new publications about the artists who illustrated them - or from time to time in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after a period of neglect, this is starting to happen and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be seen to be at work. In due course, an enterprising publisher will doubtlessly see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period either in facsimile reprint, or in freshly-designed editions using the original artwork where it survives.

274,"Writing Reviews

Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner's point of view.

Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. There are deadlines, there are restrictions, normally quite severe, on their length; and when published they claim houseroom only for as long as the newspaper they are printed in - a day or a week, at most a month. Moreover, the literary status of reviews tends to be settled by their ephemerality. It is usually supposed, not only by the public but, quite often, by the writers themselves, that reviewing is work that nobody would do if there weren't some reason -- shortage of cash would he cited most often, though another good reason is that you can't work all day on a novel or a 'serious'
book of any sort - which prevents them from occupying their time with something more valuable.
Yet reviewing is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to be bright, brisk and summarily fair in the six or eight hundred words of an ordinary newspaper review, quite another to control, without looseness of argument, the six or eight thousand words sometimes allowed by international journals. And the fifteen hundred words of a leading piece in the weekly magazines present some of the problems of both short and long. Not that length is the only consideration. For one thing, the reviewer obviously needs to think about the probable audience, the weekend skimmer at one end of the scale, the person already interested enough in the subject to tackle a serious review-article at the other. Finally, a reviewer needs to know quite a bit about quite a number of things; and must be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. It follows almost infallibly that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.
The American novelist Johh Updike, who rather looks down on criticism -- 'hugging the shore' he calls it - nevertheless enjoys some coastal reviewing in the intervals between his transoceanic novel-writing. Understandably reluctant to allow even his less ambitious voyages to go without any permanent record, he gathers together his every review, however short, into volumes with mildly self-deprecating titles. It might be thought that lesser persons should accept ephemerality as the penalty appropriate to their coastal caution, but it is hand to see why, if they can get away with it, they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the measure of permanence, and the measure of vanity, proper to their station, especially if they believe that some of their best writing has been 'buried' in reviews. I admit to feeling this about my own work.
My own principal occupation has been academic, and most of my 'serious' books are recognisably academic products, the sort of thing professors like, and are expected to do as part of their jobs. However, the English-speaking world (I think fortunately) acknowledges nothing comparable to the sharp distinction people from other cultures make between reviewing and literary study -- and so with us it is quite usual for the same people to do both. The days are gone when other academics reviled reviewer-professors for unseemly self-display, or waste of academic time, or betrayal of the dignity of their institutions. And complaints from non-professors, to the effect that the professors are taking the bread out of their mouths, are also less common than they were, partly because there is so much more reviewing nowadays that practically everyone can have some, partly, no doubt, because the bread is often such a meagre ration.
My own view is that these arrangements are good for both readers -- since they can be fairly certain the reviewer has at least some idea what he is talking about -- and professors, if only because the work helps to keep them sane. It also reminds them that they have a duty, easily neglected, to make themselves intelligible to non-professors. When talking among themselves they may feel some need to be impressively arcane, but when addressing intelligent non-professors they need to make sure they are communicating effectively.
Finally, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, and despite all that can be said to dignify it, reviewing must be a secondary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough. ",C2,"Writing Reviews. Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Most reviews are short and do not last long. They are in newspapers for a day or a week. People think reviews are not important work. They think people write reviews only for money or because they cannot do other work. But writing reviews is a skilled job. It can be short or long. The writer must think about who will read it. The writer must know many things and write well. Many reviewers write other things too. John Updike is a writer who also writes reviews. He collects his reviews in books. Some people want their reviews to be remembered. The writer of this text is a teacher. He writes books for school and also reviews. In the past, other teachers did not like teacher-reviewers. Now, it is more common. This is good for readers and teachers. It helps teachers talk clearly to others. Reviews should not be the main job. You need to do other work to write good reviews.","Writing Reviews. Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from his own experience. Most reviews are written quickly and have a short life. They have deadlines and are not very long. After they are in a newspaper for a day, week, or month, people forget them. Many people, including the writers, think reviewing is not important work. They believe people do it for money or because they cannot focus on bigger books. However, reviewing is a skilled job with different parts. Writing a short review of 600-800 words is different from a long one of 6000-8000 words. A medium review of 1500 words has its own challenges. The reviewer must consider the readers, from casual readers to experts. Reviewers need to know a lot and write in a way that smart people can understand and like. Often, reviewers write other things too. John Updike, an American novelist, does not think highly of criticism but still writes reviews. He puts his reviews in books to keep them. Others might want their reviews to last, especially if they think their best writing is in reviews. The author is a professor who writes academic books and reviews. In English-speaking countries, it is normal for the same people to do both. Before, other professors criticized this, but now it is accepted. This is good for readers because reviewers know their topic, and for professors because it keeps them sane and helps them communicate clearly. Reviewing should be a secondary job, as you need other work to do it well.","Writing Reviews. Frank Kermode examines the craft of writing reviews from a practitioner's perspective. Most reviews are produced under conditions that give them a very short active life, with tight deadlines and length restrictions. Once published in a newspaper or magazine, they typically last only a day, week, or month. This ephemeral nature often leads to the belief that reviewing is not highly valued work; many assume reviewers do it for financial reasons or because they cannot dedicate time to more substantial writing like novels. Despite this, reviewing is a skilled and multi-faceted task. Writing a concise, fair review of 600-800 words differs from managing a detailed 6000-8000 word piece without losing coherence. A 1500-word review in a weekly magazine combines elements of both. Beyond length, reviewers must consider their audience, ranging from casual readers to those interested in in-depth analysis. They need broad knowledge and the ability to write prose that is understandable and enjoyable for intelligent readers. Consequently, reviewers often engage in other writing. For example, John Updike, an American novelist who views criticism as limited, still writes reviews and collects them in books. Similarly, the author, an academic, writes both scholarly books and reviews. In English-speaking cultures, it is common for the same individuals to do both, unlike in some other cultures. Previously, academics criticized this practice, but such complaints have decreased, partly due to more reviewing opportunities. This arrangement benefits readers by ensuring knowledgeable reviewers and helps professors stay grounded and communicate effectively. Ultimately, reviewing should be a secondary occupation, as it requires engagement in other work to be done well.","Writing Reviews. Frank Kermode explores the art of review-writing from his own experience as a practitioner. Most reviews are composed and distributed under circumstances that ensure they have a brief active lifespan, constrained by deadlines and stringent length limits. Upon publication in periodicals, they occupy space only for the duration of the issue—a day, a week, or at most a month. This transient quality often defines the literary status of reviews, with many, including the public and reviewers themselves, supposing that reviewing is undertaken out of necessity, such as financial need or an inability to focus on more esteemed literary works. Nevertheless, reviewing is a skilled and complex profession. Crafting a bright, brisk, and fair review in 600-800 words is distinct from controlling a 6000-8000 word essay without argumentative looseness, while a 1500-word feature in weekly magazines presents hybrid challenges. Length is not the sole factor; reviewers must also assess their probable audience, from weekend skimmers to those seeking serious critique. Additionally, reviewers require extensive knowledge and the capacity to write prose that is both intelligible and engaging for discerning readers. It follows that reviewers typically produce other forms of writing. John Updike, the American novelist who regards criticism as inferior, still engages in reviewing and compiles his pieces into volumes. The author, primarily an academic, notes that in English-speaking societies, the sharp distinction between reviewing and literary study is absent, allowing the same individuals to pursue both. Past criticisms from academics about this practice have diminished, benefiting readers through informed reviewers and professors by maintaining their sanity and communication skills. Reviewing must remain a secondary occupation, as excellence in it depends on proficiency in other endeavors.","Writing Reviews. Frank Kermode scrutinizes the craft of review-writing from a practitioner's standpoint. The majority of reviews are authored and disseminated under conditions that guarantee an exceedingly brief active existence, imposed by deadlines and rigorous constraints on length; once published, they claim relevance only for the lifespan of the periodical—be it a day, a week, or at most a month. Moreover, the literary standing of reviews is frequently determined by their ephemerality, with a common presumption, shared by the public and often the writers themselves, that reviewing is labor undertaken due to impediments such as financial shortfalls or an incapacity to devote time to more substantial literary projects. Yet, reviewing constitutes a skilled and multi-faceted occupation. It is one matter to be incisive, succinct, and summarily equitable within the 600-800 words of a standard newspaper review, and quite another to orchestrate, without discursive laxity, the 6000-8000 words occasionally permitted by international journals. The 1500-word leading article in weekly periodicals amalgamates the complexities of both concise and extensive formats. Length, however, is not the exclusive consideration; reviewers must deliberate on their anticipated readership, spanning from the casual weekend peruser to the individual sufficiently engaged to tackle a serious review-article. Furthermore, a reviewer necessitates broad erudition and the ability to compose prose that is comprehensible and pleasurable for intelligent audiences. Consequently, it is almost inevitable that the reviewer will be an individual who produces other literary works. John Updike, the American novelist who somewhat disparages criticism as 'hugging the shore,' nonetheless partakes in reviewing and assembles his pieces into volumes. The author, whose principal vocation is academic, observes that in Anglophone cultures, there is no analogous sharp demarcation between reviewing and literary scholarship, enabling the same persons to engage in both. Historical censures from academics have waned, and this configuration advantages readers by ensuring reviewer expertise and professors by fostering sanity and lucid communication. Ultimately, reviewing must be a secondary pursuit, as proficiency in it is contingent upon excellence in other domains.","Writing Reviews

275,"Sand

Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete, I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. When you are wet it adheres to you like 'stucco', and cannot be shifted, even with a fireman's hose. But, and here's the strange thing, the moment you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, it pours off you. For days afterwards, you tip mysteriously undiminishing piles of it onto the floor every time you take on your shoes, and spray the vicinity with lots more when you peel off your socks. Sand stays with you for longer than many contagious diseases. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

Lock and Key

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed ever since human beings first built a permanent homestead. The rope-lifted beam behind the door may have given way to an electronic lock triggered by a plastic card with more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, but the urge to shut out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is, to some extent, psychological. Recently, various companies have experimented with computerised locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks by means of a digital command. But people don't like them. You may be prepared to put up with it at work, but at home, everyone wants the reassurance of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure they incorporated a proper metal key into the device.

276,"Observing Lions

In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case, their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild, we have acquired a less exalted view. 
When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt, rear cubs and among other things, scare off rivals with chorused roars. If the ultimate success of an animals behaviour is measured by its lifetime production of surviving offspring, then cooperation does not necessarily pay: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. Why, then, did not the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?
We confidently assumed that we would be able to resolve that issue in two to three years. But lions are supremely adept at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases, including krypton, argon and neon, we would add lion. Thus it has taken a variety of research measures to uncover clues about the cats behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear. 

Pop Music Review

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a landmark in the career of a talented but hitherto precarious band. New Life launched a movement that effectively redesigned the specification of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Out went the earnest angst, plain-shirted drabness and overdriven guitars of a previous era; in came a lighter blend of melodious homegrown styles. A mix of social observation and strident anger mingled easily here with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were well to the fore, as were the voices that felt no need to disguise their origins.
The album showed Bedrock to be skilful magpie collectors and observers, and a cunningly versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they went larkily after traditional English preoccupations such as sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength lay in the gentle melancholy depths it plumbed on tracks such as 'So Low', a gorgeous unfurling tune loosely hung around the theme of meteorology, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that allowed no smirking at the back. The beauty of New Life is its consistently sky-high quality - 16 tracks with absolutely no filler remains an unsurpassed record in the era of loiteringly long CDs.

Extract from an autobiography

As a child I was always fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', those mysteriously wise women who wielded such influence in the ancient world. To begin with, I only knew of the existence of one who appeared in a tale my mother had told me. An old woman of Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused and she burnt three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused, she again burnt three books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. 
I realised even then that there was a profound truth hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and in life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I used to ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson that I've never forgotten.
When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to look for something that I could bear to find out about, something that was relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveller - at the first opportunity I sent my editor a very long list of places I wasn't prepared to go to. When it comes down to it, I'm only interested in ruins, because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

What becomes of your manuscript?

When you submit your manuscript it will most likely join a heap waiting for someone to sort and sift before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. The someone is usually either the editorial department junior (i.e. under 18) or an old hand who comes in a couple of mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of these has much influence, but they are basically on your side and out to discover something original - the junior to make his or her name and acquire an author of their own if they are lucky, the old hand to justify continuing freelance employment.
If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it on to a more senior editor and eventually it will surface at an acquisition meeting. The championing editor will not only have to justify accepting your novel on the grounds of intrinsic merit and potential sales, but also say whether you as an author seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Also the question is raised of how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. To this end, publishers often like to meet a potential author before clinching the offer.",C2,"Watching Lions: People think lions hunt together well. They come from the dark and catch animals. Lions seem to work as a team. But after many years of watching lions, we think differently. In 1978, we started to study why lions hunt together and care for babies. If helping others costs an animal, why do lions do it? We thought we would find out in a few years. But lions do nothing most of the time. It took a long time to learn about them. Lions can live 18 years, so we are only now understanding. Pop Music: Bedrock's third album was very important. It changed rock music. It had happy sounds and talked about life. The band was good at writing songs. Some songs were fun, others were sad. The album has 16 great songs. My Story: As a child, I liked stories about wise women. One story was about a woman who sold books to a king. She burned some books, and he paid a lot for the rest. I learned a lesson from this. I was a lonely child. My mother said to do fun things so others would join me. It worked. When I wrote a travel book, I only wanted to write about old ruins because I like thinking about the past. Your Book: When you send your book to a publisher, it goes in a big pile. A young person or an experienced person looks at it. They want to find good books. If they like your book, they give it to a boss. The boss decides if the book is good and if you are a good author. Publishers might want to meet you before they say yes.","Observing Lions: Many people imagine lions hunting as a perfect group. At sunset, they sneak out and surround their prey. Lions appear to be social animals that work together without fighting. But after years of watching lions in the wild, we have a different view. We began our research in 1978 to learn why lions cooperate in hunting, raising cubs, and scaring rivals. If an animal's success is measured by its offspring, cooperation might not help if it is too generous. Why do lions not follow the rules of self-interest? We expected to solve this in two to three years. However, lions are very good at doing nothing. Like noble gases that do not react, lions are inactive. So, we used many methods to find clues. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now getting answers. Pop Music Review: Bedrock's third album was a big event for the band and started a new trend in rock music. It replaced old, serious styles with lighter, melodic sounds from local music. The album mixed social comments with anger and used instruments like fairground organs. Humor and irony were important, and singers did not hide their accents. Bedrock showed they were skilled at collecting ideas and writing versatile songs. Some songs were playful about English topics, but the best parts were the sad, deep tracks like 'So Low' and 'To the Brink'. The album has 16 high-quality songs with no bad ones, which is rare. Extract from an Autobiography: As a child, I was fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', wise women from ancient times. I knew one story from my mother about an old woman in Cumae. She offered nine books to King Tarquin for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered the rest for the same price. After more refusals, she burned more, and he bought the last three for 300 gold. I saw a deep truth in this about sales and life. I was a lonely only child and was often refused when I asked to play. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that others would want to join, and it worked. When I had to write a travel book, I looked for something relevant to my life. I am not a keen traveler and sent a list of places I would not go. I am only interested in ruins because I enjoy mental travel through time. What Becomes of Your Manuscript?: When you submit your manuscript, it usually goes into a slush pile. A junior editor or a freelance worker sorts through it. They have little power but want to find something new. If they think your novel is good, they pass it to a senior editor. At a meeting, the editor must argue that your book has merit and sales potential. They also consider if you are a long-term author and how easy you are to promote. Publishers often like to meet authors before making an offer.","Observing Lions: In popular belief, lions hunting represent a coordinated group effort: at dusk, they emerge stealthily and encircle their unsuspecting prey. Lions are seen as ideal social animals, overcoming disagreements to achieve shared goals like obtaining food. However, after many years of observation in the wild, we have developed a less idealistic perspective. Our research began in 1978 with the aim of understanding why lions cooperate in hunting, rearing cubs, and deterring rivals with collective roars. If an animal's evolutionary success is judged by the number of surviving offspring, cooperation may not be advantageous if it involves excessive generosity. So, why do lions not adhere strictly to genetic self-interest? We initially assumed we could resolve this question within two to three years. Yet, lions are exceptionally inactive; we might compare them to inert noble gases. Consequently, diverse research approaches were necessary to uncover insights into their behavior. Given that wild lions can live for up to 18 years, the answers to our inquiries are only now emerging. Pop Music Review: The release of Bedrock's third album was not just a milestone for the band but also initiated a movement that redefined rock music in the country for the decade. It replaced the serious angst and dull styles of the past with a lighter combination of melodic, indigenous influences. The album blended social commentary with sharp anger, incorporating sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the vocalists did not conceal their regional accents. Bedrock proved to be adept at gathering diverse inspirations and were versatile songwriters. While some tracks humorously addressed English themes like sunbathing, the album's true strength lay in its melancholic depths, evident in songs such as 'So Low', which explores meteorology, and 'To the Brink', a sincere ballad. New Life maintains consistently high quality across all 16 tracks, with no filler, setting a record in an era of overly long CDs. Extract from an Autobiography: As a child, I was always captivated by tales of 'The Sibyl', the mysteriously wise women of antiquity. Initially, I knew of one from a story my mother told: an elderly woman from Cumae offered nine books to King Tarquin for 300 gold pieces. When he declined, she burned three and offered the remainder at the same price. After further refusals, she burned more, and he eventually purchased the last three for the full amount. I recognized a profound lesson in this about salesmanship and life principles. Being a lonely only child, I often faced rejection when asking to play with others. My mother suggested I engage in activities so compelling that others would ask to join me, which proved successful. When offered the chance to write a travel book, I sought a topic relevant to my interests. As a reluctant traveler, I provided a long list of excluded destinations. Ultimately, I am only fascinated by ruins, as I prefer mental journeys through time. What Becomes of Your Manuscript?: Upon submission, your manuscript typically joins a slush pile, awaiting review by a junior editor or a part-time freelancer. These individuals have limited influence but are motivated to discover original work—the junior to build a reputation, the freelancer to secure ongoing employment. If they deem your novel promising, it is forwarded to a senior editor and discussed in an acquisition meeting. The supporting editor must justify acceptance based on the book's quality, sales potential, and your viability as a long-term author, as indicated in your query letter. Additionally, your promotability is a key factor, as new novels require substantial support. Consequently, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before finalizing an offer.","Observing Lions: In the common perception, lions engaged in hunting exemplify a marvel of group coordination: as sunset approaches, a covert group of felines springs from concealment to surround their oblivious prey. Lions are often regarded as archetypal social creatures, transcending minor conflicts to collaborate towards a common objective, such as securing sustenance. Nevertheless, after extensive observation in their natural habitat, we have cultivated a more modest assessment. Commencing our investigation in 1978, we aspired to elucidate the reasons behind lions' cooperative behaviors, including hunting, cub-rearing, and intimidating rivals with unified roars. If the ultimate measure of an animal's behavioral success is its lifetime production of surviving progeny, then altruistic cooperation may not be beneficial, as it can advantage others at one's own expense. Thus, why do the principles of evolutionary self-interest not seem to govern lions? We were confident that this issue could be resolved within two to three years. However, lions are remarkably indolent; akin to inert noble gases, they exhibit minimal activity. Therefore, a range of investigative techniques was employed to glean insights into feline behavior. Since wild lions may live for up to 18 years, the solutions to our queries are only now becoming apparent. Pop Music Review: The issuance of Bedrock's third album constituted more than a pivotal moment in the career of a talented yet previously unstable band; it catalyzed a movement that effectively reconfigured the parameters of rock music nationally for the remainder of the decade. It discarded the earnest anxiety, monotonous attire, and overpowering guitars of a bygone era, introducing instead a more buoyant amalgamation of melodious, domestically inspired styles. A fusion of societal observation and vehement discontent coexisted seamlessly with the auditory elements of fairground organs and northern brass ensembles. Wit and sarcasm were prominently featured, as were vocals that unabashedly reflected their regional origins. The album demonstrated Bedrock's proficiency as eclectic collectors and astute observers, as well as their cunning versatility in songwriting. At their most overt, they pursued traditional English themes with playful exuberance, such as sunbathing and leisurely Sundays. However, the album's genuine potency resided in the subtle, melancholic profundities explored in tracks like 'So Low', a beautifully unfolding composition loosely centered on meteorological themes, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that permitted no irreverence. The excellence of New Life lies in its uniformly superior quality—16 tracks entirely devoid of filler, an unparalleled achievement in the epoch of excessively lengthy CDs. Extract from an Autobiography: During my childhood, I perpetually harbored a fascination for narratives concerning 'The Sibyl', those enigmatic wise women who exerted significant influence in ancient societies. Initially, my awareness was limited to one account related by my mother: an aged woman from Cumae proffered nine books to Tarquin, the Roman monarch, for 300 gold coins. Upon his refusal, she incinerated three volumes and offered the remaining six at the original price. After subsequent rejections, she destroyed three more, and he ultimately acquired the final three for the total sum. I discerned even then that this narrative concealed a profound verity—a tutorial in sales tactics and existential wisdom. As a solitary only child, I frequently experienced loneliness and rejection when soliciting playmates. My mother counseled me to undertake activities so engrossing that other children would entreat to participate, a strategy that proved efficacious. This constituted another lesson I have perpetually retained. When presented with the opportunity to author a travel book, I endeavored to identify a subject I could endure investigating, one pertinent to my existence. Being an averse traveler, I promptly dispatched an extensive inventory of locales I was unwilling to visit to my editor. In essence, my interest is confined to ruins, as the travel I esteem is cerebral journeying through temporal dimensions. What Becomes of Your Manuscript?: When you submit your manuscript, it will likely be consigned to a heap known as the slush pile, awaiting categorization by either an editorial junior or a seasoned freelancer who works intermittently. Neither possesses substantial authority, but both are fundamentally supportive and intent on unearthing innovative material—the junior to establish a reputation and potentially secure an author, the veteran to validate continued contractual engagement. If they assess your novel as auspicious, it will be escalated to a senior editor and eventually deliberated in an acquisition conference. The advocating editor must not only rationalize acceptance based on intrinsic merit and commercial prospects but also evaluate whether you, as an author, represent a sustainable investment (a point you should have emphasized in your correspondence). Moreover, the issue of your promotability is raised—a critical consideration, given that new novels necessitate extensive assistance. To this end, publishers frequently prefer to convene with prospective authors prior to formalizing an offer.","Observing Lions: In the popular imagination, the hunting endeavors of lions epitomize a marvel of collective choreography: in the waning luminescence of dusk, a cohort of stealthy felines erupts from obscurity to encircle their unsuspecting quarry. Lions are perceived as quintessential social animals, rising above trivial dissensions to collaborate synergistically towards a communal objective—namely, the procurement of sustenance. However, after protracted observation in their natural milieu, we have formulated a less exalted perspective. Initiating our research in 1978, we sought to decipher the rationale for lions' cooperative behaviors, encompassing hunting, cub-rearing, and deterring adversaries with chorused vocalizations. If the ultimate efficacy of an animal's conduct is gauged by its lifetime production of viable offspring, then altruistic cooperation may not be remunerative, as excessive generosity can advantage conspecifics at one's own detriment. Why, then, do the evolutionary tenets of genetic self-interest not appear to pertain to lions? We confidently presumed that this conundrum could be elucidated within a biennial or triennial timeframe. Yet, lions are supremely adept at indolence; to the catalogue of inert noble gases, we might annex the lion. Consequently, a panoply of research methodologies was requisite to unearth clues regarding feline comportment. Given that wild lions can persist for up to 18 years, the resolutions to our inquiries are only now materializing. Pop Music Review: The release of Bedrock's third album transcended mere milestone status in the trajectory of a gifted but hitherto precarious ensemble; it inaugurated a movement that effectively reconfigured the specifications of rock music within the nation for the ensuing decade. It supplanted the earnest angst, sartorial drabness, and overdriven guitars of a preceding epoch with a more ethereal amalgamation of melodious, indigenous styles. An admixture of societal observation and strident indignation intermingled effortlessly with the sonorities of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humor and irony were conspicuously foregrounded, as were vocal deliveries that eschewed dissimulation of their provincial origins. The album evinced Bedrock's acumen as skillful magpie collectors and perspicacious observers, alongside their cunning versatility as songsmiths. At their most manifest, they pursued traditional English preoccupations with larkish exuberance, such as sunbathing and Sunday indolence. However, the album's authentic puissance resided in the gentle, melancholic profundities it plumbed on compositions like 'So Low', a gorgeously unfurling melody loosely suspended upon meteorological motifs, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that brooked no facetiousness. The splendor of New Life is its unwaveringly elevated caliber—16 tracks entirely devoid of extraneous material, an unsurpassed feat in the era of protractedly lengthy CDs. Extract from an Autobiography: During my juvenility, I was perennially captivated by lore concerning 'The Sibyl', those mysteriously sagacious women who wielded considerable sway in the ancient world. Initially, my cognizance was confined to a singular figure from a narrative imparted by my mother: an elderly woman of Cumae proffered nine volumes to Tarquin, the Roman sovereign, for 300 aurei. Upon his demurral, she immolated three tomes and offered the residual six for the identical sum. After further refusals, she consumed three additional books in flames, and he ultimately procured the remaining trio for the full price. I apprehended even then that this anecdote harbored a profound verity—a didactic exemplar in salesmanship and existential philosophy. As a solitary only child, I oftentimes endured loneliness and repudiation when soliciting companionship in play. My mother exhorted me to engage in pursuits so compelling that my peers would importune to participate, a stratagem that proved efficacious. This constituted another precept I have invariably retained. When afforded the opportunity to compose a travelogue, I was compelled to seek a subject I could tolerate investigating, one that resonated with my personal narrative. Being a reluctant voyager, I expediently dispatched a copious inventory of proscribed destinations to my editor. Ultimately, my fascination is circumscribed to ruins, as the peregrination I favor is the cerebral traversal through temporal epochs. What Becomes of Your Manuscript?: Upon submission, your manuscript will most likely be consigned to an accumulation termed the slush pile, pending sorting and sifting before it risks toppling—a task typically undertaken by either an editorial junior or a veteran freelancer engaged on a part-time basis.

If they deem your novel promising, it will be escalated to a more senior editor and eventually surface at an acquisition convocation. The championing editor must not only justify acceptance on the grounds of intrinsic merit and commercial viability but also asseverate whether you, as an author, constitute a long-term prospect (a point you will have affirmed in your correspondence). Furthermore, the question of your promotability is invariably raised—a salient factor, given that nascent novels require all available advocacy. To this end, publishers often prefer to convene with potential authors prior to consummating an offer.","Observing Lions

In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case, their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild, we have acquired a less exalted view. 
When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt, rear cubs and among other things, scare off rivals with chorused roars. If the ultimate success of an animals behaviour is measured by its lifetime production of surviving offspring, then cooperation does not necessarily pay: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. Why, then, did not the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?
We confidently assumed that we would be able to resolve that issue in two to three years. But lions are supremely adept at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases, including krypton, argon and neon, we would add lion. Thus it has taken a variety of research measures to uncover clues about the cats behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear. 

Pop Music Review

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a landmark in the career of a talented but hitherto precarious band. New Life launched a movement that effectively redesigned the specification of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Out went the earnest angst, plain-shirted drabness and overdriven guitars of a previous era; in came a lighter blend of melodious homegrown styles. A mix of social observation and strident anger mingled easily here with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were well to the fore, as were the voices that felt no need to disguise their origins.
The album showed Bedrock to be skilful magpie collectors and observers, and a cunningly versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they went larkily after traditional English preoccupations such as sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength lay in the gentle melancholy depths it plumbed on tracks such as 'So Low', a gorgeous unfurling tune loosely hung around the theme of meteorology, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that allowed no smirking at the back. The beauty of New Life is its consistently sky-high quality - 16 tracks with absolutely no filler remains an unsurpassed record in the era of loiteringly long CDs.

Extract from an autobiography

As a child I was always fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', those mysteriously wise women who wielded such influence in the ancient world. To begin with, I only knew of the existence of one who appeared in a tale my mother had told me. An old woman of Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused and she burnt three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused, she again burnt three books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. 
I realised even then that there was a profound truth hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and in life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I used to ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson that I've never forgotten.
When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to look for something that I could bear to find out about, something that was relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveller - at the first opportunity I sent my editor a very long list of places I wasn't prepared to go to. When it comes down to it, I'm only interested in ruins, because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

What becomes of your manuscript?

When you submit your manuscript it will most likely join a heap waiting for someone to sort and sift before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. The someone is usually either the editorial department junior (i.e. under 18) or an old hand who comes in a couple of mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of these has much influence, but they are basically on your side and out to discover something original - the junior to make his or her name and acquire an author of their own if they are lucky, the old hand to justify continuing freelance employment.
If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it on to a more senior editor and eventually it will surface at an acquisition meeting. The championing editor will not only have to justify accepting your novel on the grounds of intrinsic merit and potential sales, but also say whether you as an author seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Also the question is raised of how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. To this end, publishers often like to meet a potential author before clinching the offer."
277,"Enough Sleep?

Tiredness, it is often claimed, has become the modern condition. As the richer, busier countries have grown, so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected, and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists, or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.
Part of this interest is in sleep in general: in its rhythms, its uses and in problems with sleeping. But a central preoccupation remains. 'People need more sleep,' says one leading sleep researcher. 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.'
Recently, a sleep researcher tried an experiment. He offered his subjects the opposite of the modern routine. 'I allowed them to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to reach an equilibrium of eight-and-a-quarter hours. That indicates a great rebound of sleep - sleep that they hadn't been getting!'
In Europe, such propositions are perhaps most thoroughly tested in a small unassuming building on a university campus in the English Midlands. The university sleep research laboratory has investigated, among many subjects, the effects of fatigue on sailors, the effects of airpot noise on sleepers, and the dangers of motorway driving for flagging drivers.
For guinea pigs, they advertise in the student newspapers. Subjects are picked up by taxi, paid PS5 an hour, and asked to adjust their sleeping patterns according to instructions. Dr Louise Reyner provides reassurance: 'Some people are quite worried, because you're putting electrodes on their heads, and they think you can see what they're dreaming or thinking.'
In fact, the laboratory's interest is more physical. In a darkened room stands a motorway simulator, the front section of car facing a wide projection screen. The subjects are always told to arrive at 2pm, in the body's natural mid-afternoon lull, after a short night's sleep or no sleep at all. The projector is switched on and they are asked to drive, while answering questions. An endless road rolls ahead, sunlight glares; and the air is warm.
The young men all deny they are going to fall asleep. Dr Reyner has a video recording of one trying not to. At first the person at the wheel is very upright, wet and bleary eyes determinedly fixed on the windscreen. Then he begins to blink briefly, every now and again; then for longer, and more often, with a slight drop of the head. Each nod grows heavier than the last. The blinks become a 10-second blackout. Every time, he jerks awake as if nothing has happened. But the car, by the second or third occasion, has shot off the carriageway.
A coffee might have helped. Two cups, Dr Reyner says, even after no sleep at all, can make you a safe driver for half an hour or more. She recommends a whole basket of alertness products: tablets, energy drinks, caffeinated chewing gum. Shift workers, she is quite sure, could probably use them.
But apart from these findings, what else do know about human sleep with any kind of certainty? It is known that humans sleep, like other mammals, according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness, from stage one sleep, the shallowest, to stage four, the deepest. When dreams occur, which is usually during the lightest sleep, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids, thus preventing injuries.
Beyond this, certainties blur into theories. It is often suggested, for example, that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.
However, there is a strong degree of certainty among scientists that women seep for half an hour longer than men, and that older people require less sleep, though they don't know why. When asked what sleep is for, some sleep researchers reply in cosmic terms: 'Sleep is a tactic to travel through time without injury.'
Moreover, people may have had different sleep patterns in the past. A history professor has investigated nocturnal British life between 1500 and 1850 and discovered that sleeping routines were very different. People went to bed at nine or ten, then woke up after midnight, after what they called their 'first sleep', stayed awake for an hour, and then had their 'morning sleep'.
The interlude was a haven for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time thieving. The poorest were the greatest beneficiaries of this quiet time, fleetingly freed from the constraints and labours that ruled their day-time existence.
By the 17th century, however, as artificial light became more common, the rich began to switch to the more concentrated, and economically more efficient, mode of recuperation that we follow today. Two centuries later, the industrial revolution pushed back the dusk for everyone except some country-dwellers, by making most people work longer hours in lighted buildings.
Yet beyond Europe and America, the old pattern was widespread until quite recently, and according to a leading anthropologist, in some non-western settings there are still no rigid bedtimes. People go to bed for a few hours, and then get up again. The idea of a night's solid sleep does not apply. For certain tribal societies, human and animal noises and the need to supervise the fire and watch out for predators combine to make continuous sleep impossible. It seems that people all round the world are badly in need of sleep.",C2,"Do you get enough sleep? Many people are tired. In rich countries, people are busy and do not sleep enough. In the USA, 40 million people are always tired. Some books in Britain have people who cannot sleep. People want to know about sleep. A sleep expert says people need more sleep. They wake up early to avoid busy traffic. In an experiment, people slept 14 hours a night. After three weeks, they slept 8.25 hours. This shows they needed more sleep. In England, there is a sleep lab. They study tired sailors, airport noise, and driving when tired. They pay students to sleep in the lab. Doctors put wires on heads, but they do not see dreams. They use a car simulator. People drive on a screen when tired. They try not to sleep, but they fall asleep. The car goes off the road. Coffee can help. Two cups make you drive safely for 30 minutes. Doctors suggest pills and drinks for energy. We know people sleep every day. Sleep has four stages from light to deep. Dreams happen in light sleep. The body cannot move then. Some think sleep fixes the body, but we are not sure. Women sleep 30 minutes more than men. Old people sleep less. Sleep helps pass time safely. Long ago, people slept twice at night. They woke up for an hour. Poor people liked this quiet time. Later, with lights, rich people slept all night. Now, many people work long hours with lights. In some places, people do not sleep all night. They wake up because of noises or to watch fires. People everywhere need more sleep.","Do you get enough sleep? Many people say they are tired. In rich, busy countries, sleeplessness and worry are common. Research in the USA found 40 million Americans are often tired. Some popular books in Britain have characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep labs. People are interested in sleep, its patterns, and problems. A sleep researcher says people need more sleep because they cut sleep when busy and wake up early to avoid traffic. In an experiment, people slept up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept 8.25 hours, showing they had a big need for sleep. In Europe, a university sleep lab in England tests sleep. They study tired sailors, the effect of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving when tired. They advertise for students, pay them, and change their sleep times. Dr. Louise Reyner says people worry about electrodes on their heads, but the lab does not see dreams. Instead, they use a car simulator in a dark room. People arrive tired and drive on a screen while answering questions. They try to stay awake, but often fall asleep, and the car goes off the road. Coffee can help; two cups make driving safe for 30 minutes. Dr. Reyner recommends energy products like tablets and drinks for shift workers. We know humans sleep daily in cycles with four stages from light to deep sleep. Dreams occur in light sleep, and the body is paralyzed to prevent injury. Some theories say sleep repairs the body, but it might happen when awake, so it is not certain. Scientists are sure women sleep 30 minutes longer than men, and older people need less sleep. Sleep is called a way to pass time safely. In the past, people had two sleeps at night, waking for an hour in between. This time was for thinking or stealing, and poor people benefited. With artificial light, the rich started sleeping all night. Later, the industrial revolution made people work longer in lit buildings. In some non-western places, people still do not sleep all night due to noises or watching for dangers. People worldwide need more sleep.","Is enough sleep being obtained? It is often claimed that tiredness is a modern condition. As wealthier, busier nations have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have increased in society. Research in the USA has identified 40 million Americans as chronically affected by sleep issues. In Britain, recent best-selling novels have featured insomniacs as main characters or used sleep-research labs as settings. There is general interest in sleep, including its rhythms, functions, and disorders. A key concern is that people require more sleep; a leading researcher notes that individuals reduce sleep when busy, waking early to avoid rush hour traffic. In a recent experiment, subjects were allowed to sleep up to 14 hours nightly for a month. They took three weeks to stabilize at 8.25 hours, indicating a significant sleep deficit. In Europe, such ideas are tested at a university sleep laboratory in the English Midlands. This lab has studied fatigue's effects on sailors, airport noise impacts on sleep, and the dangers of motorway driving for tired drivers. Volunteers are recruited from student newspapers, transported by taxi, paid hourly, and instructed to adjust sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures them that electrodes on their heads do not reveal dreams or thoughts. The lab focuses on physical aspects, using a car simulator in a dark room where subjects drive on a projected road while answering questions, often arriving tired. Despite denying sleepiness, subjects eventually fall asleep, as shown in videos where blinking increases and heads nod until brief blackouts occur, causing the car to veer off the road. Coffee can mitigate this; two cups may enable safe driving for over 30 minutes even after no sleep. Dr. Reyner suggests various alertness aids like tablets and energy drinks for shift workers. Beyond these findings, it is known that humans follow a daily sleep cycle with four stages from light to deep sleep. Dreams typically happen in light sleep, with body paralysis preventing injury. Theories propose that sleep repairs tissues or rests the brain, but this might occur during wakefulness, leaving uncertainties. Scientists are confident that women sleep 30 minutes longer than men and that older adults need less sleep, though reasons are unclear. Some researchers describe sleep as a strategy to traverse time safely. Historically, sleep patterns differed; people in Britain from 1500 to 1850 had two sleep periods nightly, waking for an hour of reflection or activity, which benefited the poor. With the spread of artificial light, the rich adopted continuous sleep, and the industrial revolution extended work hours under lighting. In some non-western societies, fragmented sleep persists due to environmental factors, showing that global sleep needs are unmet.","Is sufficient sleep being achieved? It is frequently asserted that fatigue characterizes the modern era. As affluent, industrious nations have expanded, insomnia and anxiety have similarly risen in the collective consciousness. Studies in the United States have revealed that 40 million Americans suffer chronically from sleep deprivation, while recent best-selling novels in Britain have portrayed insomniacs as protagonists or utilized sleep-research laboratories as backdrops. This interest encompasses sleep in general, including its cycles, purposes, and disturbances. A central issue is the need for more sleep; a prominent sleep researcher observes that people curtail sleep during busy periods, arising prematurely to evade rush hour congestion. In an experiment, participants were permitted to sleep up to 14 hours per night for a month. They required three weeks to attain a stable sleep duration of eight and a quarter hours, suggesting a substantial rebound effect from prior sleep loss. In Europe, such hypotheses are rigorously examined at a modest university sleep research facility in the English Midlands. This laboratory has investigated various topics, such as the impact of fatigue on sailors, the consequences of airport noise on sleepers, and the perils of motorway driving for weary drivers. Volunteers are solicited through student publications, collected by taxi, compensated hourly, and directed to modify their sleep schedules. Dr. Louise Reyner provides reassurance that electrodes attached to their heads do not enable the observation of dreams or thoughts. The laboratory's focus is more physiological; in a darkened chamber, a motorway simulator—comprising a car front facing a projection screen—is employed. Subjects, instructed to arrive fatigued in the afternoon lull, drive while responding to queries on an endless road simulation. Despite initial denials of drowsiness, they eventually succumb to sleep, as documented in recordings showing progressive eye closure and head nodding leading to brief lapses and vehicular deviation. Caffeine can offer relief; according to Dr. Reyner, two cups of coffee can render one a safe driver for half an hour or longer post-sleep deprivation. She advocates for a range of alertness-enhancing products, such as tablets and caffeinated gums, particularly for shift workers. Beyond these insights, it is established that humans adhere to a circadian rhythm with four sleep stages, from light to deep, and that dreaming occurs predominantly in light sleep with associated bodily paralysis to prevent harm. While theories speculate that sleep facilitates tissue repair or cerebral rest, these processes may occur during wakefulness, rendering definitive conclusions elusive. However, there is strong scientific consensus that women sleep half an hour longer than men and that the elderly require less sleep, albeit for unknown reasons. Some researchers metaphorically describe sleep as a mechanism to navigate time without detriment. Historically, sleep patterns differed; in Britain from 1500 to 1850, individuals experienced segmented sleep, awakening after a 'first sleep' for an interval of reflection or illicit activities, which particularly advantaged the impoverished. The proliferation of artificial lighting prompted the affluent to adopt consolidated sleep, and the industrial revolution further extended waking hours in illuminated environments for the masses. In certain non-western contexts, discontinuous sleep persists due to factors like noise and vigilance needs, indicating a universal deficiency in sleep adequacy.","Is adequate sleep being attained? It is often contended that weariness has become emblematic of contemporary existence. As more prosperous and bustling nations have advanced, insomnia and disquiet have concurrently proliferated within the populace. Investigations in the United States have ascertained that 40 million Americans are chronically afflicted, whilst recent literary bestsellers in Britain have featured insomniacs as central figures or employed sleep-research laboratories as their milieus. This fascination pertains broadly to sleep, encompassing its rhythms, utilities, and pathologies. A predominant concern remains the insufficiency of sleep; a distinguished sleep researcher asserts that individuals curtail slumber during periods of busyness, rising unduly early to circumvent rush hour traffic. In a recent experimental undertaking, subjects were afforded the opportunity to sleep for up to 14 hours nightly over a month. They necessitated three weeks to achieve an equilibrium of eight and a quarter hours, indicative of a pronounced sleep rebound from prior deprivation. In Europe, such propositions are most assiduously evaluated at an unassuming university sleep research laboratory in the English Midlands. This institution has scrutinized, inter alia, the effects of fatigue on mariners, the impacts of airport acoustics on sleepers, and the hazards of motorway navigation for flagging drivers. For participants, advertisements are placed in student periodicals; individuals are conveyed by taxi, remunerated per hour, and enjoined to adapt their somnolent patterns per directives. Dr. Louise Reyner offers reassurance that the application of electrodes to craniums does not permit the discernment of oneiric or cognitive content. In actuality, the laboratory's purview is more corporeal; within a darkened chamber resides a motorway simulator, comprising the frontal segment of an automobile oriented toward a expansive projection screen. Subjects are invariably instructed to present themselves at 2 p.m., during the body's innate afternoon trough, subsequent to abbreviated or absent sleep. The projector is activated, and they are tasked with driving whilst responding to interrogatories. An interminable roadway unfolds ahead, with sunlight glaring and ambient warmth pervading. The youthful males uniformly disavow any propensity for somnolence; Dr. Reyner possesses a video recording depicting one individual endeavouring to resist. Initially, the driver maintains an erect posture, with moist and bleary eyes resolutely fixed upon the windscreen. Subsequently, he commences blinking transiently, intermittently; then for prolonged durations and with greater frequency, accompanied by a slight cephalic descent. Each nod becomes progressively more profound, and the blinks evolve into ten-second eclipses of consciousness. Upon each arousal, he startles awake as if naught had transpired, yet by the second or third occurrence, the vehicle has diverged from the carriageway. Caffeine might have ameliorated the situation; Dr. Reyner posits that two cups, even following total sleep deprivation, can confer safe driving capabilities for half an hour or more. She endorses an array of vigilance-enhancing commodities: tablets, energy beverages, caffeinated chewing gum. For shift labourers, she is convinced of their potential utility. Apart from these discoveries, what else is known about human somnolence with certitude? It is established that humans slumber, akin to other mammals, in accordance with a diurnal cycle. Once asleep, they oscillate amongst four disparate stages of unconsciousness, from the most superficial stage one to the profoundest stage four. During episodes of dreaming, which typically arise in the lightest sleep, encephalic processes induce paralysis of the corpus save for the hands and eyelids, thereby precluding injury. Beyond this, certainties dissolve into conjectures. It is frequently hypothesized, for instance, that sleep facilitates the reparation of bodily tissues, the restoration of muscular integrity, or the repose of the frontal cerebral region governing speech and creativity. However, these phenomena might transpire more expeditiously during tranquil wakefulness, thus leaving the matter unresolved. Nevertheless, there exists a robust consensus among scientists that females sleep for an additional half-hour relative to males, and that geriatric individuals necessitate less sleep, albeit the etiologies remain obscure. When queried regarding the function of sleep, some researchers respond in cosmic parlance: 'Sleep constitutes a tactic to traverse temporal dimensions without incurring harm.' Furthermore, historical sleep patterns may have diverged; a professor of history has examined nocturnal life in Britain from 1500 to 1850, uncovering that somnolent routines were distinctly different. Individuals retired at nine or ten o'clock, then awakened post-midnight subsequent to their 'first sleep', remained awake for an hour, and then engaged in their 'morning sleep'. This interlude served as a sanctuary for introspection, oneiric recollection, or even nocturnal pilfering. The most indigent derived the greatest benefit from this tranquil period, transiently emancipated from the rigors and toils dominating their diurnal existence. By the seventeenth century, however, as artificial illumination became more prevalent, the affluent commenced adopting the more concentrated and economically efficient mode of recuperation prevalent today. Two centuries later, the industrial revolution protracted dusk for all save certain rural inhabitants, by compelling the majority to labour extended hours within illuminated edifices. Yet beyond Europe and America, the archaic pattern remained widespread until recently, and according to a preeminent anthropologist, in some non-western contexts, rigid bedtimes are still absent. Individuals repose for several hours, then rise anew. The notion of an uninterrupted night's sleep is inapplicable. For specific tribal societies, amalgamations of human and animal clamors, the necessity to tend fires, and vigilance against predators collectively preclude continuous somnolence. It appears that populations globally are profoundly deficient in sleep.","Enough Sleep?

Tiredness, it is often claimed, has become the modern condition. As the richer, busier countries have grown, so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected, and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists, or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.
Part of this interest is in sleep in general: in its rhythms, its uses and in problems with sleeping. But a central preoccupation remains. 'People need more sleep,' says one leading sleep researcher. 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.'
Recently, a sleep researcher tried an experiment. He offered his subjects the opposite of the modern routine. 'I allowed them to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to reach an equilibrium of eight-and-a-quarter hours. That indicates a great rebound of sleep - sleep that they hadn't been getting!'
In Europe, such propositions are perhaps most thoroughly tested in a small unassuming building on a university campus in the English Midlands. The university sleep research laboratory has investigated, among many subjects, the effects of fatigue on sailors, the effects of airpot noise on sleepers, and the dangers of motorway driving for flagging drivers.
For guinea pigs, they advertise in the student newspapers. Subjects are picked up by taxi, paid PS5 an hour, and asked to adjust their sleeping patterns according to instructions. Dr Louise Reyner provides reassurance: 'Some people are quite worried, because you're putting electrodes on their heads, and they think you can see what they're dreaming or thinking.'
In fact, the laboratory's interest is more physical. In a darkened room stands a motorway simulator, the front section of car facing a wide projection screen. The subjects are always told to arrive at 2pm, in the body's natural mid-afternoon lull, after a short night's sleep or no sleep at all. The projector is switched on and they are asked to drive, while answering questions. An endless road rolls ahead, sunlight glares; and the air is warm.
The young men all deny they are going to fall asleep. Dr Reyner has a video recording of one trying not to. At first the person at the wheel is very upright, wet and bleary eyes determinedly fixed on the windscreen. Then he begins to blink briefly, every now and again; then for longer, and more often, with a slight drop of the head. Each nod grows heavier than the last. The blinks become a 10-second blackout. Every time, he jerks awake as if nothing has happened. But the car, by the second or third occasion, has shot off the carriageway.
A coffee might have helped. Two cups, Dr Reyner says, even after no sleep at all, can make you a safe driver for half an hour or more. She recommends a whole basket of alertness products: tablets, energy drinks, caffeinated chewing gum. Shift workers, she is quite sure, could probably use them.
But apart from these findings, what else do know about human sleep with any kind of certainty? It is known that humans sleep, like other mammals, according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness, from stage one sleep, the shallowest, to stage four, the deepest. When dreams occur, which is usually during the lightest sleep, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids, thus preventing injuries.
Beyond this, certainties blur into theories. It is often suggested, for example, that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.
However, there is a strong degree of certainty among scientists that women seep for half an hour longer than men, and that older people require less sleep, though they don't know why. When asked what sleep is for, some sleep researchers reply in cosmic terms: 'Sleep is a tactic to travel through time without injury.'
Moreover, people may have had different sleep patterns in the past. A history professor has investigated nocturnal British life between 1500 and 1850 and discovered that sleeping routines were very different. People went to bed at nine or ten, then woke up after midnight, after what they called their 'first sleep', stayed awake for an hour, and then had their 'morning sleep'.
The interlude was a haven for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time thieving. The poorest were the greatest beneficiaries of this quiet time, fleetingly freed from the constraints and labours that ruled their day-time existence.
By the 17th century, however, as artificial light became more common, the rich began to switch to the more concentrated, and economically more efficient, mode of recuperation that we follow today. Two centuries later, the industrial revolution pushed back the dusk for everyone except some country-dwellers, by making most people work longer hours in lighted buildings.
Yet beyond Europe and America, the old pattern was widespread until quite recently, and according to a leading anthropologist, in some non-western settings there are still no rigid bedtimes. People go to bed for a few hours, and then get up again. The idea of a night's solid sleep does not apply. For certain tribal societies, human and animal noises and the need to supervise the fire and watch out for predators combine to make continuous sleep impossible. It seems that people all round the world are badly in need of sleep."
278,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly, by hand. It is, in other words, not only an agricultural metaphor, it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production, if the conditions are right, of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction. The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate.
Since television as a technology is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments. Two little-known, distinct alternatives deserve mentioning since they highlight what television might have been - in a different social context.
Experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone were followed up, so to speak, by radio amateurs in Britain in the early 1930s. Various popular science journals, such as Radio News, had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers and, throughout the 1930s, experimenting amateurs were active in many parts of the country. But Big Business, represented by the British Radio Manufacturers Association, in 1938 agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out. And so there passed, at least in Britain, the historical 'moment' for a counter-cultural development of television as a widely diffused, grass-roots, egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting in some form was, however, tied not only to strong economic interests, but also to the deep structures of modern societies. In spite of the activities of TV amateurs, television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s, and as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry. In fact, television was throughout the 19030s predominantly watched in public settings also outside of the USA. For example, in Britain, public viewing of television was the way in which most early audiences actually experienced the medium and this was even more the case in Germany. While the vision of grass-roots or amateur, two-way television was quite obviously doomed to a very marginal position at the very best, television systems largely based on collective public reception were in fact operating in several countries in the 1930s and may, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen as having presented more of a threat to the domestication of the medium. But it was a threat that was not to materialise.
Manufacturers saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets as soon as the price could be reduced, and given the division and relation between the public and private domains fundamental to modernity, centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states. And all of this is now also happening on a global scale.
There is a clear relationship between the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernisation meant increasing centralisation and concentration of capital and political power, the break-up of traditional communities produced new ways of life. Mobility was both social and geographical, and both forms implied that individuals and households were, both literally and metaphorically, 'on the move' in ways that left them relatively isolated compared to people in much more stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting was both an answer to the need felt by central government to reach all citizens with important information efficiently, and a highly useful instrument in the production of the harmonising, stabilising 'imagined community' of the nation-state.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the World Wars, the interest in broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources necessary for conscious, informed and autonomous participation in political, social and cultural life played a very important role in many countries. Of course television is changing, and there is the risk that the very term broadcasting becomes outmoded or at least inadequate. In which case, this metaphor will be seen only as referring to a particular organisation of audio-visual technology during a certain centralised phase of social modernisation. ",C2,"Broadcasting means sending out information to many people. It started as a word for planting seeds by hand. This idea is about growing things in a big area. It is like a farm with many seeds. The seeds are like the information sent from one place. We look at why television was made to send from one center. Television is like the phone but for many people. It was made to send from one place to homes. Some people tried to make television for talking back, like a phone. But big companies made rules that stopped them. So, television became a one-way medium. In the past, people watched television in public places, not at home. But later, companies sold TVs for homes. As people had more money, they bought TVs for their houses. This happened in many countries. Broadcasting helps governments talk to everyone. It makes people feel part of one country. It was important for democracy, giving equal information. Now, television is changing, and the word broadcasting might not fit anymore.","Broadcasting originally meant scattering seeds by hand on a farm. This metaphor shows hope for growth in wide circles, like a good harvest from a central source. We explore why television, a technology for sending words and pictures, was organized in this centralized way. Television is related to two-way communication like the telegraph, but it was designed as a mass medium from the start. This fit the social and economic structures of modern societies. Some experiments tried other forms, like two-way television for amateurs in Britain in the 1930s. But big business set standards that ended these efforts. So, television did not become a grassroots, egalitarian tool. In the early days, television was often watched in public places, such as in the USA and Germany. However, manufacturers focused on selling TVs for homes as prices dropped. With rising living standards, more people could afford home entertainment. Broadcasting met the need for governments to reach citizens and create a sense of national community. It also supported democracy by providing equal access to information. Now, as technology changes, the term broadcasting may become outdated.","The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the agricultural practice of sowing seeds broadly by hand. This metaphor embodies optimistic modernism, suggesting planned growth and a potential rich harvest from centralized resources. The text examines why television, a technology for electronic transmission of words and pictures, was organized in a centralized manner that aligned with this metaphor. Although television is technologically similar to two-way communication devices like the telegraph and telephone, it was conceived early on as a mass medium. This centralized approach corresponded with socio-economic structures and lifestyles in modern societies. Alternative organizational forms, such as two-way television experiments by radio amateurs in Britain during the 1930s, were pursued but ultimately failed due to industry standards set by entities like the British Radio Manufacturers Association. Consequently, television evolved as a one-way broadcast system. Initially, television was predominantly viewed in public settings in countries like the USA and Germany, but manufacturers soon prioritized domestic sets for mass sales. As living standards improved, especially from the 1920s onward, home entertainment became widespread. Centralized broadcasting served governmental needs to disseminate information efficiently and fostered a sense of national identity. It also played a role in democratic processes by ensuring equal access to information. However, with ongoing technological changes, the concept of broadcasting may become less relevant.","Broadcasting' initially denoted the agricultural method of broadly sowing seeds by hand, serving as a metaphor for optimistic modernism that envisions planned growth and a bountiful harvest from centralized sources. This analysis investigates why television, an electronic medium for transmitting words and pictures, was structured in a centralized fashion that made this agricultural analogy appropriate. Despite television's technological kinship with interactive communication forms such as the telegraph and telephone, it was conceptualized from its inception as a centralized mass medium. This alignment with socio-economic frameworks and modern societal norms meant that alternative models, though experimented with, remained marginal. For instance, in 1930s Britain, amateur radio enthusiasts explored two-way television as a potential substitute for the telephone, but commercial interests, through standardized regulations, suppressed these grassroots initiatives. Early television consumption often occurred in public venues, as seen in the USA and Germany, posing a theoretical challenge to its domestication. Nonetheless, manufacturers capitalized on the mass-market potential of home receivers, leveraging rising affluence and the public-private dichotomy of modernity. Centralized broadcasting effectively addressed governmental imperatives for efficient citizen communication and contributed to the construction of a cohesive national identity. Furthermore, it supported democratic ideals by facilitating equitable access to informational resources. In light of evolving technologies, the term 'broadcasting' risks obsolescence, reflecting a specific historical phase of audiovisual media organization.","The concept of 'broadcasting' etymologically derives from the agricultural practice of sowing seeds broadly by hand, constituting a metaphor that not only reflects agrarian imagery but also embodies the ethos of optimistic modernism, anticipating planned expansion and prolific yields contingent upon favorable conditions. This metaphor presupposes centralized resources intended for dissemination and replication, prompting an inquiry into why television—a technology for the electronic transmission of words and pictures—was institutionalized in a manner that rendered this agricultural analogy apt. Although television shares technological affinities with bidirectional communication systems like the telegraph and telephone, its early conceptualization as a centralized mass medium is particularly striking, harmonizing with prevailing socio-economic structures and modernizing societal paradigms. Endeavors to establish alternative organizational frameworks, such as the two-way television experiments conducted by British radio amateurs in the 1930s, were ultimately eclipsed by commercial standardization, thereby foreclosing the potential for a diffused, egalitarian communication form. Initially, television was predominantly experienced in public exhibition contexts, notably in the United States and Germany, which could have posed a substantive challenge to its domestication. However, manufacturers, recognizing the lucrative prospects of mass-produced domestic receivers, catalyzed a shift towards home-centric consumption, facilitated by enhanced living standards and the intrinsic division between public and private spheres in modernity. Centralized broadcasting concomitantly served governmental objectives for efficient information dissemination and the fabrication of a unifying national imagined community, while also advancing democratic principles through equitable access to informational capital. Consequently, broadcasting emerged as the predominant modality for radio and television, though contemporary technological evolution may render the term anachronistic, symbolizing a specific epoch in the centralization of audiovisual media during social modernization.","BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

279,"Metals

It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river, waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw, or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It did not have the feel of stone, but it was attractive. In such a way, one could conjecture that gold entered the lives of primitive people.
Given the malleability of the metal, it very soon became a much sought-after material. Copper may also have been discovered by accident, and once the value of copper tools was realised, the search for its ores and for ways of getting the copper out of them was pursued with vigour. Thus, metalworking was added to our ancestors' battery of life-enhancing accomplishments.

St Ives

There was silence as we lugged our bags down the winding, cobbled lane that led to the heart of town, bent double against the force eight gale and trying in vain to avoid the icy waves that smashed over the promenade. There was no one on the streets and the shutters in every cottage on the waterfront were bolted tight against the battering. We had watched the weather worsen as we chugged into St Ives on the tiny single-track railway. As the ominous grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season - without a car - no longer seemed such a good idea. I had lured my friend into joining me with the promise of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast, and snug evenings, toasting ourselves before open fires.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again, perhaps we can.
Computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric landscapes and environments and populate them with virtual communities - digital creations with some of the needs, independence and capabilities of real-world humans. We can establish rules of conduct and replicate social units. Then we can turn down the rainfall - or turn up the population - and watch how this cyber-culture and its artificial people react.",C2,"People long ago found shiny yellow stones in rivers. They liked them. The stones were gold. Gold is soft and easy to shape. People also found copper. They made tools from copper. This helped them live better. In St Ives, it was very windy and rainy. No one was outside. We went there by train. It was not a good time to visit. I told my friend we would walk and sit by fires. We study the past with computers. We make pretend worlds on computers. We see how people live in these worlds when things change.","In the Stone Age, people might have found gold by rivers. They liked its shiny look. Gold is soft, so people wanted it a lot. Copper was also found by chance. People made tools from copper and looked for more. This started metalworking. In St Ives, we walked in strong wind and rain. The streets were empty, and houses were closed. We came by a small train. The weather was bad, so our trip was not fun. I had promised my friend nice walks and warm evenings. For studying the past, we use computer models. We create digital worlds with fake people. We change things like rain or population and watch what happens.","Stone Age people may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. For example, someone might have found a shiny yellow pebble in a river and picked it up. It was attractive and different from stone, so gold entered their lives. Because gold is malleable, it soon became a popular material. Copper was probably discovered accidentally too, and when people realized its value for tools, they actively searched for copper ores. Thus, metalworking became an important skill for early humans. In St Ives, we carried our bags down a cobbled lane in a strong gale, trying to avoid waves. The town was deserted with shutters closed. We had arrived by a small railway as the weather worsened, making our off-season visit without a car seem unwise. I had convinced my friend to come with promises of coastal walks and cozy evenings by fires. Studying the past is challenging because it is over, and we cannot experiment on ancient cultures. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric environments and virtual communities. We set rules for behavior and social groups, then adjust factors like rainfall or population to observe the reactions.","It may have been a desire for self-adornment that sparked the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Imagine an early ancestor by a river, idling and stumbling upon a shiny yellow pebble, which they picked up. This pebble, unlike stone, was appealing, and thus gold likely entered primitive societies. Given gold's malleability, it quickly became highly sought after. Copper was also probably discovered by accident, and once the utility of copper tools was recognized, the pursuit of its ores and extraction methods intensified. Consequently, metalworking was added to the repertoire of human advancements. In St Ives, we trudged with our bags along a winding, cobbled lane, hunched against a force eight gale and evading icy waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and every waterfront cottage had its shutters secured against the storm. We had observed the deteriorating weather while arriving on the tiny single-track railway, and the ominous grey skies made our off-season trip to Cornwall without a car seem ill-advised. I had enticed my friend with the prospect of scenic walks along the Cornish coast and snug evenings by open fires. The difficulty in studying the past is that it is irrevocable; the people and forces that shaped their lives are gone, leaving only archaeological clues. We cannot test hypotheses through experiments on past cultures. Nonetheless, computer modelling enables us to simulate prehistoric landscapes and populate them with virtual communities—digital entities with human-like needs and capabilities. By establishing conduct rules and replicating social structures, we can manipulate variables such as rainfall or population density and observe the responses of these artificial societies.","Perhaps it was a yearning for self-adornment that ignited the curiosity of Stone Age individuals regarding metals. Envision an early human, lounging by a riverbank while awaiting prey or merely passing time, who chanced upon a lustrous yellow pebble and retrieved it from the riverbed. This object, distinct from stone in texture, captivated them, thereby introducing gold into the lives of primordial communities. Owing to the metal's malleability, it rapidly evolved into a coveted material. Copper, too, may have been unearthed fortuitously, and upon comprehending the efficacy of copper implements, endeavors to locate its ores and devise extraction techniques were pursued with fervor. Thus, metallurgy was incorporated into the arsenal of human innovations that enhanced existence. In St Ives, we hauled our luggage down a serpentine, cobbled passageway, stooped against a force eight gale and futilely attempting to dodge the frigid waves that assailed the promenade. The thoroughfares were devoid of life, and the shutters of every seaside dwelling were fastened securely against the onslaught. We had witnessed the weather deteriorate as we journeyed into St Ives aboard the diminutive single-track railway; as the menacing grey skies enveloped us, our decision to visit Cornwall during the off-season sans an automobile appeared increasingly imprudent. I had persuaded my companion to accompany me by extolling the virtues of ambles along the magnificent Cornish coastline and tranquil evenings basking before crackling fires. The quandary of historical inquiry lies in its irrevocability; the individuals who thrived in epochs of prosperity and endured hardships of conflict and dearth have long perished, and the impetus behind their settlements and social coalescence has faded from recollection. Archaeology furnishes fragmentary evidence, yet we cannot subject our conjectures to empirical testing on bygone or extant cultures. We are incapable of rewinding history to witness its unfoldment anew. However, computer modelling affords us the capacity to reconstruct prehistoric terrains and ecosystems, infusing them with virtual populace—digital constructs endowed with certain necessities, autonomy, and aptitudes of authentic humans. We can institute protocols of behavior and emulate social units, then modulate parameters such as precipitation or demographic size to scrutinize the reactions of these cyber-cultures and their synthetic inhabitants.","Metals

It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river, waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw, or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It did not have the feel of stone, but it was attractive. In such a way, one could conjecture that gold entered the lives of primitive people.
Given the malleability of the metal, it very soon became a much sought-after material. Copper may also have been discovered by accident, and once the value of copper tools was realised, the search for its ores and for ways of getting the copper out of them was pursued with vigour. Thus, metalworking was added to our ancestors' battery of life-enhancing accomplishments.

St Ives

There was silence as we lugged our bags down the winding, cobbled lane that led to the heart of town, bent double against the force eight gale and trying in vain to avoid the icy waves that smashed over the promenade. There was no one on the streets and the shutters in every cottage on the waterfront were bolted tight against the battering. We had watched the weather worsen as we chugged into St Ives on the tiny single-track railway. As the ominous grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season - without a car - no longer seemed such a good idea. I had lured my friend into joining me with the promise of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast, and snug evenings, toasting ourselves before open fires.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again, perhaps we can.
Computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric landscapes and environments and populate them with virtual communities - digital creations with some of the needs, independence and capabilities of real-world humans. We can establish rules of conduct and replicate social units. Then we can turn down the rainfall - or turn up the population - and watch how this cyber-culture and its artificial people react."
280,"How to Write Poetry

Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day, but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. Setting oneself up as a know-all is dangerous, so I have decided to side-step the whole issue by saying that, for someone just beginning to write, no advice can be a substitute for abundant reading, extensive writing, and the freeing of the imagination and spirit in whatever way seems fruitful, barring total anarchy. Some people need their life to be reasonably secure before a poem will come; others can write their way out of misery. Some write to a timetable: others wait for some moment of crystallisation, a brainwave or slow dawning. All are right, providing they are not echoing some prescriptive score. And it's this finding of a tune which is important, hearing the still small voice inside yourself and feeding it, and watering it, and letting it out for air from time to time; one day it'll be old enough to take care of itself.

The Short Story

In the short story there is no room for overcrowding with too many characters, slabs of lengthy narrative, prolonged reminiscence or retrospection. Flashbacks must be fleeting, and only used if there is no other way to throw light on an issue. One effective way to do this is through a flash of memory in the leading character's mind; the recollection or reminder of an incident or scene, which stirred the current conflict. Such a recollection can get the story on its way or take it a big step forward at a crucial moment, but never at any time must it be allowed to put a brake on the action. In this respect, dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. Two voices in discussion can reveal two sides of a question in far less time than it takes to explain it from only one person's viewpoint. It also avoids unnecessary wordage and holds or increases a reader's interest. Overwriting can kill a short story from the start, but this doesn't mean that brevity must reduce it to the level of a synopsis. Conflict and action must be as well sustained in a short story as in a novel, but in the short story the art lies in making every word count in a compact space.

Screenplays

Anyone who knows how to play chess will understand how to write a screenplay for a film. Most chess players stumble from beginning to end. We don't know much, but we know enough to play. We move without really knowing what's going to happen further on in the game. Maybe we can see one or two moves ahead, and, if we can, were pleased by our uncanny ability to see even that far ahead. Better than the days when we couldst see ahead at all - when we were playing blindly.
Over time, as we learned more about playing chess, we made a startling revelation: chess depends more upon long-term strategy than upon short-term tactics. Up till then, we'd been happy with a rather short-sighted approach. Suddenly, we became aware of 'the big picture'. We began to see the game as a whole, not just a series of individual moves. And once we saw the game as a whole, we began to see patterns emerge in the play. Gambits, they call them. And the patterns have names, such as openings, middle games and end games. In chess, as in screenplay writing, the more often you play, the more aware you become of its complexities.

Looking at Writing

'Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew, or write'. More than a century ago, Charles Darwin got it right: language is a human instinct, but written language is not. Language is found in all societies, present and past. Although languages change, they do not improve: English is no more complex than the languages of Stone Age tribes; modern English is not an advance of Old English. All healthy children master their language without lessons or corrections. When children are thrown together without a usable language, they invent one of their own. Compare all this with writing.
Writing systems have been invented only infrequently in history. They originated only in a few complex civilisations and they started off code and slowly improved over the millennia. Until recently, most children never learned to read or write; even with today's universal education, many children struggle and fail. A group of children is no more likely to invent an alphabet than it is to invent the internal combustion engine. Children are wired for sound, but print is an optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on. We need to understand how the contraption called writing works, how the minds of the children work, how to get the two to mesh.",C2,"How to Write a Poem: It is hard to tell someone how to write a poem. It is like walking in a dangerous place. You must be free and not follow strict rules. To start, read a lot and write a lot. Use your imagination. Some people write when they feel safe. Others write when they are sad. Some write at the same time every day. Others wait for a good idea. All ways are good if you find your own way. Listen to your own thoughts and let them grow. One day, you will write well. The Short Story: A short story is small. Do not use too many people or long stories. Use short memories to explain things. Talking between people is good. It shows different ideas quickly and keeps the reader interested. Do not use too many words. Every word must be important. Screenplays: Writing a movie script is like playing chess. At first, you do not know what to do. You learn slowly. Then you see the whole game and patterns. The more you write, the better you get. Looking at Writing: People naturally learn to speak. Children talk without being taught. But writing is not natural. Writing was invented long ago. It is hard to learn. Children must work to learn to write. We must help them learn.","How to Write Poetry: Giving advice on writing poetry is risky. It is like moving through a dangerous area where you need to be spontaneous. But if you make a mistake, things can go wrong. I avoid acting like an expert. For beginners, the best advice is to read widely, write often, and free your imagination in a helpful way. Some writers need a stable life to create poems. Others write to escape problems. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid if they are original. The key is to find your own voice, listen to it, and let it develop over time. The Short Story: In a short story, avoid too many characters, long descriptions, or extended flashbacks. Use brief memories only if necessary to explain the story's conflict. Dialogue is very useful because it shows different perspectives quickly and keeps the reader engaged without extra words. Do not overwrite, but do not make it too short like a summary. Keep the action and conflict strong in a limited space. Screenplays: Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Beginners often move without knowing the future. With experience, they learn to see the entire game and recognize patterns like openings and endings. Practice helps you understand the complexities. Looking at Writing: Charles Darwin said that speaking is natural for humans, as seen in children's babbling, but writing is not. All societies have language, and it does not get better over time. Children learn to speak easily without teaching. In contrast, writing was invented in few places and has improved slowly. Many children find it hard to learn, even with education. Children do not invent writing on their own; it must be taught carefully.","How to Write Poetry: Offering guidance on poetry writing is challenging, akin to navigating a minefield where spontaneity is essential, but errors can lead to failure. I refrain from presenting myself as an authority. For novices, extensive reading, frequent writing, and unleashing creativity in productive ways are irreplaceable. Some individuals require stability to compose poetry, whereas others use writing as an outlet for distress. Certain writers adhere to routines, while others await moments of inspiration. All approaches are correct if they avoid imitation. The crucial aspect is discovering one's unique style, nurturing inner thoughts, and allowing them to mature independently. The Short Story: A short story must not be cluttered with excessive characters, lengthy narratives, or prolonged reflections. Flashbacks should be brief and employed only to illuminate key points, such as through a character's sudden memory that triggers the central conflict. Dialogue is highly effective, as it can reveal multiple viewpoints efficiently, maintain reader interest, and reduce verbosity. Overwriting can ruin a story, but brevity should not render it a mere outline. Conflict and action must be consistently developed within a concise format. Screenplays: Composing a screenplay parallels chess playing. Initially, players proceed uncertainly, gradually learning to perceive long-term strategies over short-term moves. With practice, they identify patterns like gambits and phases of the game, enhancing their understanding of the craft's intricacies. Looking at Writing: Charles Darwin noted that humans have an innate capacity for speech, evident in children's chatter, but writing is not instinctive. Languages exist universally without improvement, and children acquire them effortlessly. Conversely, writing systems emerged rarely in history, evolving slowly, and many children struggle to learn them despite education. Writing must be deliberately taught, as children do not invent it naturally.","How to Write Poetry: Instructing others on poetry composition is perilous, reminiscent of traversing a minefield where spontaneity is paramount, yet a misstep can引爆 numerous certainties. I eschew the role of an omniscient guide. For those commencing their writing journey, no counsel can supplant copious reading, prolific writing, and the liberation of imagination and spirit in constructive manners. Some poets necessitate a secure existence for inspiration, while others articulate their way through adversity. Certain authors operate on a fixed schedule, whereas others anticipate a crystallising moment or gradual realisation. All methodologies are valid provided they do not replicate prescriptive dictates. The essence lies in uncovering one's distinctive voice, heeding that internal whisper, fostering it diligently, and eventually permitting it autonomy. The Short Story: The short story genre permits no overcrowding with superfluous characters, extensive descriptive passages, or protracted retrospections. Flashbacks ought to be fleeting and utilised solely when indispensable for elucidating a narrative element, such as a protagonist's recollection that instigates the prevailing conflict. Such memories can propel the plot at pivotal junctures but must never impede the action. Dialogue proves more efficacious than many budding writers recognise; it can expound dual perspectives swiftly, circumvent冗长, and sustain or heighten reader engagement. Overwriting may annihilate a story from its inception, yet conciseness should not degrade it to a synopsis. Conflict and action must be as robustly sustained as in a novel, with the artistry residing in maximising each word's impact within a confined scope. Screenplays: Crafting a screenplay is analogous to chess: novices often proceed haphazardly, gradually discerning that long-term strategy outweighs immediate tactics. With accrued experience, they perceive the game holistically, identifying patterns termed gambits, including openings, middle games, and endgames. Repeated practice augments awareness of the medium's complexities. Looking at Writing: Charles Darwin astutely observed that humanity possesses an instinctive proclivity for speech, as manifested in juvenile babbling, whereas no innate tendency exists for baking, brewing, or writing. Languages are ubiquitous across societies, immutable in their complexity, and mastered by children sans formal instruction. In contrast, writing systems were infrequently invented within advanced civilizations, evolving from rudimentary codes over millennia. Despite contemporary universal education, numerous children grapple with literacy, as writing is an acquired skill that must be assiduously inculcated, unlike the natural acquisition of speech.","How to Write Poetry: Expounding on the craft of poetry is fraught with peril, akin to frolicking through a minefield where spontaneity is imperative, yet a single misstep can detonate a plethora of certitudes. I have opted to circumvent the issue by asserting that, for neophytes, no advice can serve as a surrogate for abundant perusal, extensive composition, and the emancipation of imagination and spirit in whatever manner proves fruitful, barring utter anarchy. Some individuals require their existence to be reasonably secure before a poem manifests; others can inscribe their way out of despondency. Certain writers adhere to a timetable; others await a moment of crystallisation, a brainwave or gradual dawning. All approaches are legitimate, provided they are not echoing some prescriptive score. The quintessence is the discovery of a unique tune, attending to the still small voice within, nurturing it assiduously, and eventually allowing it autonomy. The Short Story: In the short story, there is no latitude for overcrowding with a surfeit of characters, slabs of protracted narrative, or prolonged reminiscence. Flashbacks must be ephemeral and deployed only if indispensable for illuminating an issue, such as through a flash of memory in the protagonist's psyche that stirs the current conflict. Such recollections can initiate the narrative or advance it significantly at a crucial moment, but under no circumstances should they retard the action. In this regard, dialogue is more utilitarian than many aspiring authors apprehend; two voices in discourse can unveil dichotomous perspectives more expediently than a unilateral exposition, while also obviating superfluous verbosity and maintaining or augmenting reader interest. Overwriting can vitiate a short story ab initio, yet brevity must not reduce it to the level of a synopsis. Conflict and action must be as meticulously sustained as in a novel, with the artistry lying in ensuring every word is consequential within a compact framework. Screenplays: Anyone conversant with chess will comprehend screenplay composition; most players meander initially, gradually realising that the game hinges more on long-term strategy than short-term tactics. With accrued proficiency, they discern the big picture, perceiving patterns such as gambits, openings, middle games, and endgames. In screenplay writing, as in chess, frequent engagement heightens awareness of its intricacies. Looking at Writing: Charles Darwin accurately posited that man has an instinctive tendency to speak, evident in the babble of young children, whereas no child has an innate propensity to bake, brew, or write. Language is ubiquitous across all societies, immutable in its complexity, and mastered by children without pedagogical intervention. Conversely, writing systems have been invented sporadically in history, originating in few complex civilizations and evolving from cipher-like forms over millennia. Despite universal education, many children struggle with literacy, as writing is an ancillary skill that must be painstakingly acquired, unlike the instinctive grasp of oral language.","How to Write Poetry

281,"The Heat is On

We've all heard of global warming, but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives?

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about, but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. And since the atmosphere is intimately linked every aspect of the planet on which we live, any changes to climate will have significant knock-on effects for plants and animals, as well as water and soils.
We humans have learned to use such natural resources to our advantage, enabling us to produce food, build great cities and support six billion members of the human race. Any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously. The problem we have is knowing just how the world will change, and what is causing these changes.
There is no doubt, for example, that over the last 100 years or so, human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases -- which are closely related to global temperature. It seems likely that these increased concentrations, which are set to continue building up in the near future, are already affecting global climate, but our poor knowledge and understanding of the global heat balance make the current and future situations uncertain. What we do know is that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have fluctuated in close harmony with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years.
This would indicate that the two are almost certainly related. Evidence gleaned from a range of sources suggests that our planet has warmed at the surface by about 6C over the past century. Most scientists think that this trend is unlikely to be natural in origin and is, in part, a result of human pollution of the atmosphere.
A lot of research has gone into predicting the conditions that will result from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs known as general circulation models, or GCMs. They run on powerful computers, use fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to analyse the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation and other climatic factors to predict climatic condition for the past, present or future.
Unfortunately, they are simplifications of the real would and have numerous deficiencies. Their results are only approximate and they are also slow to run and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system, although we do realise its complexity.
Despite these research difficulties, most people agree on perhaps the most important aspect of climatic change from the viewpoint of contemporary human societies: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. In this case, the approximate predictions produced by GCMs are being used to gain some insight into the nature and conditions of the world that we will inhabit over the next few generations.
Currently, they suggest that the average annual global surface temperature will increase by between 1C and 3.5C by the year 2100; that the average sea level around the world will rise by 15-95 cm; and that changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, to become more frequent in some places.
These forecasts should leave us in little doubt about the potential impact of climatic change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate have the potential to affect the geographical locations of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands, the mix of species they contain and their ability to provide the various benefits on which societies depend for their continued existence. Thus, the whole range of resources on which we rely is sensitive to changes in climate. This includes food production, water resources and human settlements. The effects, some of which are potentially irreversible, are likely to be unfavourable in many areas.
But this would not be true for all. In fact, some climate change impacts will probably be beneficial. Scientists in some countries have already identified useful environmental trends that are closely linked to the warming that has occurred to date. In Australia, for example, research has shown that the average yield of wheat has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, and climate trends have played a significant part in this greater food production.
The most important climatic factor observed in this case was the rise, in recent decades, of the minimum temperature. Among other things, the warmer temperatures have meant fewer frosts, and this has caused less damage to harvests. 
However, many of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. Relatively small changes in climate can influence the availability of water, either due to long-term dying of the climate or by increasing the frequency of droughts. Associated problems are likely to arise first in arid and semi-arid regions and more humid areas where demand or pollution have already created shortages.
The Mediterranean Basin is one example of this and in recent decades decreasing trends in precipitation totals have already been identified in western-central parts of the basin as well as marked changes in seasonality. A clear tendency for rainfall to be concentrated into a shorter period of the year has been noted in the Alentejo region of southern Portugal, with the proportion of annual rainfall falling in autumn and winter, increasing at the expense of spring totals.
A further undesirable effect is likely to be changes to glacial processes. This will impact on glacier ice, ground ice and sea ice, which in turn will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats and human structures and facilities. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that the Arctic's ice cover will melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.
But probably the most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the twenty-first or 'greenhouse' century will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean -- warmer water occupies a greater volume than cold water -- and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe.
Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results, with London, New York and Tokyo being just a few of the candidates for significant disruption. Huge numbers of people stand to lose their homes and livelihoods and this could produce many millions of environmental refugees.
Arguably the most severe consequences would be experienced by several small, low-lying island states, since entire countries could cease to exist if worst-case scenarios are realised. The consequences would be devastating, not only for the people and culture of these islands, but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those who had been displaced.",C2,"The Earth is getting warmer. This is called global warming. It will change the weather everywhere. This can be bad for plants, animals, and people. People use things from nature like water and soil. If these change, it can cause problems. Scientists think people are making the Earth warmer by adding gases to the air. They use computers to guess what will happen. The computers say the Earth will get hotter, the sea will rise, and there will be more bad weather like floods. This can hurt where people live and how they get food and water. In some places, like Australia, warmer weather has helped grow more wheat. But in other places, it can cause less water and more droughts. The sea rising can flood cities like London and New York. Some small islands might disappear under water, and people would have to leave their homes.","Global warming means the Earth is getting hotter. This will change the weather all over the world and affect plants, animals, and humans. People use natural resources like water and soil for food and cities. Changes to these resources are serious. Scientists believe human activities have increased gases in the air, which makes the Earth warmer. They use computer models to predict the future. These models show that by 2100, the average temperature could rise by 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius, sea levels could go up by 15 to 95 cm, and extreme weather like heatwaves and floods may happen more often. This can harm forests, food production, and water supplies. In Australia, warmer temperatures have helped increase wheat yields because there are fewer frosts. But in dry areas, water may become scarce. Rising sea levels could flood coastal cities such as London and New York, and some islands might be underwater, forcing people to move.","Global warming refers to the increasing temperature of the Earth, which is expected to alter weather patterns worldwide and have significant effects on ecosystems and human societies. Humans depend on natural resources like water and soil for agriculture and development, and any changes pose serious risks. Evidence indicates that human actions have raised levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, contributing to this warming. Scientists use general circulation models (GCMs) on computers to forecast climate changes, though these models have limitations. Predictions include a temperature increase of 1°C to 3.5°C by 2100, sea level rise of 15-95 cm, and more frequent extreme weather events. These changes could shift ecological zones, impact food and water resources, and threaten coastal areas through flooding. For instance, in Australia, higher minimum temperatures have boosted wheat production by reducing frost damage. However, in regions like the Mediterranean, reduced rainfall and droughts are concerns. Melting ice in the Arctic may ease shipping but increase iceberg risks. Sea level rise, driven by thermal expansion and ice melt, endangers coastal populations, potentially creating environmental refugees from places like small island nations.","Global warming entails a rise in Earth's temperature that will profoundly influence global weather systems, with cascading effects on flora, fauna, and human civilizations. Humanity relies on natural resources such as water and soils for sustenance and infrastructure, making any alterations critically important. Scientific consensus holds that human activities have substantially elevated atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which correlate with global temperature increases. Researchers employ general circulation models (GCMs)—complex computer simulations based on physical laws—to project future climates, albeit with approximations due to system complexities. These models anticipate an average global temperature increase of 1°C to 3.5°C by 2100, a sea level rise of 15-95 cm, and shifts in precipitation patterns, leading to more extreme weather phenomena. Consequently, ecological systems may relocate, affecting biodiversity and the provisioning of essential services like food and water. In Australia, climatic trends including higher minimum temperatures have enhanced wheat yields by mitigating frost occurrences. Conversely, arid regions face heightened water scarcity, exemplified by declining precipitation in the Mediterranean Basin. Glacial melt could alter habitats and facilitate Arctic navigation but raise iceberg hazards. Most notably, sea level rise from thermal expansion and ice melt poses severe threats to coastal zones, potentially displacing millions and endangering low-lying island states.","Global warming, characterized by an escalation in the Earth's temperature, is projected to instigate alterations in meteorological conditions across the globe, with profound implications for ecosystems and human societies. The intricate interdependence between the atmosphere and terrestrial systems means that climatic shifts will precipitate significant secondary effects on biological communities and abiotic resources. Human utilization of these natural resources underpins agricultural output, urban development, and the sustenance of vast populations, rendering any modifications a matter of grave concern. Indisputably, anthropogenic activities have augmented atmospheric concentrations of certain gases over the past century, which exhibit a strong correlation with global thermal readings. Although general circulation models (GCMs)—sophisticated computational tools applying fundamental physicochemical principles—are deployed to prognosticate climatic scenarios, they remain simplifications fraught with deficiencies and uncertainties. Notwithstanding these limitations, projections indicate an average surface temperature increase of 1°C to 3.5°C by 2100, a sea level rise of 15-95 cm, and a heightened incidence of extreme weather events. Such changes could reconfigure ecological distributions, compromise the integrity of forests and grasslands, and imperil the resources essential for societal continuity, including food security and hydrological supplies. In Australia, for example, elevated minimum temperatures have contributed to augmented wheat yields by reducing frost frequency. However, in arid and semi-arid regions, diminished precipitation exacerbates water shortages, as observed in the Mediterranean Basin where seasonal rainfall patterns have shifted. Additionally, glacial degradation may impact cryospheric elements, facilitating maritime activities in the Arctic yet increasing iceberg perils. The most conspicuous consequence, sea level rise driven by thermal expansion and meltwater influx, threatens coastal inundation, potentially culminating in the displacement of multitudes and the existential jeopardy of low-lying island nations.","The Heat is On

Most of this research uses computer programs known as general circulation models, or GCMs. They run on powerful computers, use fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to analyse the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation and other climatic factors to predict climatic condition for the past, present or future.
Unfortunately, they are simplifications of the real would and have numerous deficiencies. Their results are only approximate and they are also slow to run and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system, although we do realise its complexity.
Despite these research difficulties, most people agree on perhaps the most important aspect of climatic change from the viewpoint of contemporary human societies: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. In this case, the approximate predictions produced by GCMs are being used to gain some insight into the nature and conditions of the world that we will inhabit over the next few generations.
Currently, they suggest that the average annual global surface temperature will increase by between 1C and 3.5C by the year 2100; that the average sea level around the world will rise by 15-95 cm; and that changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, to become more frequent in some places.
These forecasts should leave us in little doubt about the potential impact of climatic change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate have the potential to affect the geographical locations of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands, the mix of species they contain and their ability to provide the various benefits on which societies depend for their continued existence. Thus, the whole range of resources on which we rely is sensitive to changes in climate. This includes food production, water resources and human settlements. The effects, some of which are potentially irreversible, are likely to be unfavourable in many areas.
But this would not be true for all. In fact, some climate change impacts will probably be beneficial. Scientists in some countries have already identified useful environmental trends that are closely linked to the warming that has occurred to date. In Australia, for example, research has shown that the average yield of wheat has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, and climate trends have played a significant part in this greater food production.
The most important climatic factor observed in this case was the rise, in recent decades, of the minimum temperature. Among other things, the warmer temperatures have meant fewer frosts, and this has caused less damage to harvests. 
However, many of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. Relatively small changes in climate can influence the availability of water, either due to long-term dying of the climate or by increasing the frequency of droughts. Associated problems are likely to arise first in arid and semi-arid regions and more humid areas where demand or pollution have already created shortages.
The Mediterranean Basin is one example of this and in recent decades decreasing trends in precipitation totals have already been identified in western-central parts of the basin as well as marked changes in seasonality. A clear tendency for rainfall to be concentrated into a shorter period of the year has been noted in the Alentejo region of southern Portugal, with the proportion of annual rainfall falling in autumn and winter, increasing at the expense of spring totals.
A further undesirable effect is likely to be changes to glacial processes. This will impact on glacier ice, ground ice and sea ice, which in turn will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats and human structures and facilities. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that the Arctic's ice cover will melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.
But probably the most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the twenty-first or 'greenhouse' century will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean -- warmer water occupies a greater volume than cold water -- and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe.
Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results, with London, New York and Tokyo being just a few of the candidates for significant disruption. Huge numbers of people stand to lose their homes and livelihoods and this could produce many millions of environmental refugees.
Arguably the most severe consequences would be experienced by several small, low-lying island states, since entire countries could cease to exist if worst-case scenarios are realised. The consequences would be devastating, not only for the people and culture of these islands, but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those who had been displaced."
282,"Maps

The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth's surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. In early times distance wha often expressed in units of time, for example 'so many hours' march' or 'a day's journey by river', but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than they did about actual distance. The other element is direction, but for the ordinary traveller, whose main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', the accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Partly for this reason, written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Even today, certain types of maps, for example those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Similarly, conspicuous landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs, realistic or conventional, and varied in size to indicate their importance. Clearly the conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map, and also from place to place, so that in studying early maps the first essential is to understand the particular convention employed.
The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which these elements of distance and direction are determined and in the comprehensiveness of the map content. In this development, cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. For example, instead of determining direction by observing the position of a shadow at midday, or of a constellation in the night sky, or even of a steady wind, use was made of terrestrial magnetism through the magnetic compass, and instruments were evolved which enabled horizontal angles to be calculated with great accuracy. 
The application of astronomical concepts, and the extension of the knowledge of the world through 
exploration, encouraged attempts to map the known world. Then astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is flattened slightly at the poles, which introduced further refinements into the mapping of large areas. Meanwhile, the demands being made of the map maker were shifting significantly. The traveller or the merchant ceased to be the sole user of maps. The soldier, especially after the introduction of artillery, and the problems of range, field of fire, and dead ground which it raised, demanded an accurate representation of the surface features, in place of the earlier conventional or pictorial delineation, and a solution in any degree satisfactory was not reached until the contour was invented.
Then there was the archaeologist, the historian and, much later, the modern geographer, each with their own special requirements. In order to address these, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions', from geological strata and climatic regimes to land use. It is the present widespread recognition of the value of the map in the co-ordination and interpretation of phenomena in many sciences that has led to what may truly be called a modern renaissance o cartography.
It would be misleading of me to represent the stages summarily sketched above as being either continuous or consecutive. There have been periods of retrogression or stagnation, broken by others of rapid development, during which outmoded ideas have held their place beside the new. Again, cartographers have constantly realised the theoretical basis for progress, but have had to wait for technical improvement in their instruments before they could apply their new ideas. Since the easiest way to make a map is to copy an old one, and considerable capital has often been locked up in printing places or stock map publishers have often been resistant to new ideas. Consequently, maps must never be accepted uncritically as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique. 
Clearly, the maps, many thousands in number, which have come down to us today, are the results of much human work and thought. They constitute therefore an invaluable record for the students of man's past. It is above all this aspect that makes the study of historical cartography so fascinating and so instructive.",C2,"A map shows places on Earth. It tells you how far and which way to go. Long ago, people said how many hours to walk. This showed if the land was easy or hard to walk on. Direction was not always exact. People used signs for important places. Maps were different for different uses. Over time, maps got better. People used science to make maps more accurate. For example, they used a compass for direction. Astronomers found Earth is not a perfect circle. Soldiers needed better maps for fighting. Now, many people use maps, like scientists. Maps can copy old ones, so they are not always new. Old maps tell us about the past. Studying old maps is interesting.","A map shows where things are on Earth and how they relate to each other through distance and direction. In the past, distance was often measured in time, like hours of walking, which showed how easy the land was to cross. Direction was not always shown accurately. People used signs for landmarks, with size showing importance. Maps had different styles for different purposes. The history of map-making is about making maps more accurate and detailed. Science helped, such as using a compass instead of shadows or stars. Astronomers discovered Earth is slightly flat at the poles, improving maps. Soldiers needed precise maps for weapons, leading to contours. Today, map-makers show many things like rocks and weather. Maps have not always improved steadily; sometimes they stayed the same or got worse. Map publishers often copied old maps, so maps may not show the latest knowledge. Old maps are valuable records of human history and are fascinating to study.","The purpose of a map is to display the relationships between points and features on Earth's surface, based on distance and direction. Historically, distance was expressed in units of time, such as hours of march, indicating the ease of terrain rather than exact distance. Direction was often not precisely represented, as travelers prioritized practical routes over accuracy. Early maps used signs for landmarks, with variations in size to denote importance, and conventions differed by purpose and location. Cartography has evolved to improve accuracy in distance and direction, incorporating sciences like astronomy and magnetism, such as with the magnetic compass. Discoveries, like Earth's slight flattening at the poles, enhanced mapping. The needs of users expanded from travelers to soldiers, who required detailed surface features, leading to innovations like contours. Modern cartographers map various distributions, such as geology and climate, driven by the recognition of maps' value in science. Progress in cartography has not been continuous; periods of stagnation occurred, and technical limitations or resistance from publishers hindered updates. Thus, maps should not be accepted uncritically as evidence. Historical maps provide a valuable record of human effort and thought, making their study both fascinating and instructive.","A map graphically represents the spatial relationships of points and features on the Earth's surface, determined by distance and direction. In earlier times, distance was frequently conveyed in temporal units, such as 'a day's journey,' which revealed more about the terrain's navigability than precise measurements. Direction was often inaccurately depicted, as practical itineraries sometimes rivaled maps; even today, certain maps, like railway diagrams, may disregard true directions. Landmarks were initially marked with symbolic or realistic signs, sized according to importance, with conventions varying by map purpose and region. The history of cartography centers on enhancing the precision of these elements and expanding map content, aided by scientific advances. For instance, the magnetic compass replaced methods based on shadows or constellations, and instruments enabled accurate angle calculations. Astronomical insights and exploration facilitated global mapping, while the discovery of Earth's oblate spheroid shape refined large-area cartography. Evolving demands, such as those from artillery-using soldiers requiring exact topographical representations, spurred innovations like contour lines. Subsequently, diverse users like archaeologists and geographers necessitated mappings of distributions, from geological strata to land use, fostering a modern renaissance in cartography. However, progress has been intermittent, with phases of regression and stagnation, often due to technical constraints or publishers' reluctance to abandon established maps. Consequently, maps must be critically assessed rather than taken as definitive records. The extant maps, products of extensive human endeavor, constitute an invaluable historical archive, rendering the study of cartography profoundly engaging and educational.","The fundamental objective of a map is to graphically illustrate the interrelations of terrestrial points and features, governed by the principles of distance and direction. Historically, distance was often quantified in temporal terms, such as 'so many hours' march,' which imparted more insight into the relative ease of traversing local terrains than exact spatial measurements. Direction, while crucial, was not always rendered with precision for ordinary travelers, who prioritized pragmatic itineraries over cartographic accuracy; this persists in modern contexts, like schematic railway maps that eschew true directional fidelity. Early maps employed signs—either realistic or conventional—to denote conspicuous landmarks, with variations in scale indicating significance, and the conventions utilized were contingent upon the map's purpose and geographical origin. Cartographic history is characterized by advancements in the accuracy of distance and direction determination and the comprehensiveness of content, drawing upon auxiliary sciences. For example, terrestrial magnetism via the magnetic compass supplanted rudimentary methods like shadow observation or stellar positioning, and sophisticated instruments were developed to compute horizontal angles with high precision. The integration of astronomical concepts and expanded global knowledge from exploration prompted endeavors to map the known world, while the recognition of Earth's oblate spheroid shape introduced refinements for large-scale mapping. Concurrently, the demands on cartographers evolved significantly; beyond travelers and merchants, soldiers—particularly post-artillery introduction—required accurate depictions of surface features to address issues of range and field of fire, culminating in innovations such as contour lines. Subsequently, specialists including archaeologists, historians, and geographers imposed unique requirements, compelling contemporary cartographers to devise methods for mapping diverse distributions, from geological strata to climatic regimes. This widespread acknowledgment of maps' utility in coordinating and interpreting multifarious scientific phenomena has engendered a veritable renaissance in cartography. Nonetheless, it would be erroneous to depict this evolution as linear or uninterrupted; periods of retrogression or stagnation have occurred, during which obsolete ideas persisted alongside novel ones. Cartographers have frequently grasped theoretical foundations for progress but awaited technical enhancements in instrumentation for implementation. Moreover, the propensity to replicate existing maps, compounded by economic investments in printing, has often rendered publishers resistant to innovation, necessitating a critical approach to maps as reflections of contemporaneous knowledge and technique. The myriad maps extant today are the culmination of extensive human intellectual and laborious efforts, thereby constituting an invaluable archival resource for historical inquiry, with this dimension rendering the study of historical cartography both profoundly fascinating and instructive.","Maps

I have been welcomed warmly. It's a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very, very isolated place.

Elliot

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other and he took no notice of me. He never forgot a face though, and when I ran across him here or there he shook hands with me cordially, but showed no desire to further our acquaintance; and if I saw him at the opera, say, he being with a person of high rank, he was inclined not to catch sight of me. But then I happened to make a somewhat startling success as a playwright, and presently I became aware that Elliot regarded me with a warmer feeling. One day, I received a note from him asking me to lunch and I conceived the notion that he was trying me out. But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.

Alfred Hitchcock

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message that stirred the audience, nor was it a great performance, he believed that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience.
Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable, he was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience. ",C2,"I am in a foreign land.

Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable, he was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory. He set his sights on film, pure film, and the most dispassionate, mathematically calculable beauty of what a strip of film can be made to do to an audience. "
284,"In those days the council houses stretched all over the western side of the city: row after row of huddled, dingy dwellings in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. In summer the chemicals from the May and Baker factory two miles away came and hung round the doors and gardens with an indescribable smell of sulphur, and the most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he negotiated somebody's front path.
Most of this early life I've forgotten. But there is a memory of sitting, or perhaps balancing, at any rate precariously, on some vantage point near an upstairs window, and looking at the houses as they faded away into the distance. Later on there are other phantoms - faces that I can't put names to, my mother, ironing towels in the back room of a house that I don't think was ours, snow falling over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham.
That my mother should intrude into these early memories is no surprise. I remember her as a small, precise and nearly always angry woman, the source of whose anger I never quite understood, and consequently couldn't do anything to appease. Even as a child, though, accompanying her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer excursions into the city, I'm sure that I had some notion of the oddity of her personality.
She was, for instance, quite the most solitary person I have ever known, as alone in a room full of people as on a moor. To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which occasionally broke out in furious spring-cleanings or handwashings and instructions to 'behave proper'.
As a moral code this was completely beyond my comprehension: even now I'm not sure that I understand it. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening to radio programmes that my mother liked; it meant - oh, a hundred proscriptions and prohibitions.
In time other figures emerged onto these stern early scenes. For all her solitariness, my mother wasn't without her cronies. There was Mrs Buddery, who was fixated on the Royal Family, Mrs Winall, who said exactly nothing, except for grunts supporting the main speaker, and Mrs Laband - livelier than the others, and of whom they vaguely disapproved.
It was only later that I comprehended what poor company this trio was, they formed a depressed and depressing sisterhood, a little dribble of inconsequent talk about bad legs, the cold weather and the perils of ingrate children, a category in which I nearly always felt myself included.
Looking back, it was as if a giant paperweight, composed of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her cronies, the obligation to 'behave proper', lay across my shoulders, and that it was my duty immediately to grow up and start the work of prising it free.
This was easier said than done. Growing up in West Earlham at this time followed a well-regulated pattern. Until you were five you simply sat at home and got under your parents feet (I can remember awful aimless days, when I must have been about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat frostily in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were packed off to Avenue Road infants school half a mile away in the direction of the city.
The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat - these were extraordinary contraptions in cast-iron with improvised safety-straps. As far as I recall, my mother consigned me to the care of other children in the street for this journey.
If I remember anything about these early years it's the summer holidays, those days when you caught occasional glimpses of the world that existed outside West Earlham: a vague old man who lived next door to Mrs Buddery and told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fete, once, held at a house far away in Christchurch Road, where a motherly woman doled out lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity - a kind of junior charity, I think - only for my mother, to whom subsequent application was made, to dismiss the scheme on the grounds that its organisers were 'only after your money'.
Mercenary motives were a familiar theme of my mother's conversation, and politicians my mother held in the deepest contempt of all. If she thought of the House of Commons - and I am not sure if her mind was capable of such an unprecedented leap of the imagination - it was as a kind of opulent post office where plutocrats ripped open letters stuffed with five pound notes sent in by a credulous public.
No doubt I exaggerate. No doubt I ignore her virtues and magnify her frailties. But there was precious little milk of human kindness in my mother, 
it had all been sucked out of her, sucked out and thrown away.
To do my mother justice she wasn't unconscious of her role as the guardian of my education. On Sundays occasionally, she would take me - in my 'good clothes' - on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Here, hand-in-hand, suspicious, but mindful of the free admission, we would parade through roomfuls of paintings by the Norwich School of Artists.
My mother wasn't, it must be known, altogether averse to this recreation, and eventually almost got to have opinions on the various subjects presented for her edification. I can remember her stopping once in front of a fine study of a Roman soldier in full battle gear to remark, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' I recall this as a solitary instance of my mother attempting to make a joke.",C2,"In the past, there were many houses on the west side of the city. They were small and not very nice. In summer, a bad smell came from a factory. A paperboy often wrinkled his nose because of the smell. I do not remember much from when I was young. But I remember sitting near a window and looking at the houses far away. I also remember my mother. She was a small woman who was often angry. I did not know why she was angry. She liked to be alone. She had rules for how to behave. For example, I had to sit quietly and listen to the radio. She had some friends, like Mrs. Buddery, Mrs. Winall, and Mrs. Laband. They talked about small things. I felt I had to grow up and be free. As a child, I stayed at home until I was five. Then I went to school. Some children went by bike, but I walked with other children. I remember summer holidays. I saw an old man who told stories. I went to a charity event, but my mother did not like it. She thought people only wanted money. She did not like politicians. Sometimes on Sundays, she took me to a museum. We looked at paintings. Once, she made a joke about a painting of a soldier.","In those days, many council houses covered the western part of the city. They were rows of small, dull homes made of orange brick or white stucco. In summer, chemicals from a factory two miles away brought a strong sulphur smell to the doors and gardens.

I have forgotten most of my early life, but I recall sitting near an upstairs window and seeing the houses fade into the distance. Later, I remember other things, like my mother ironing towels in a back room and snow on a big house. My mother was a small, precise woman who was often angry. I never understood her anger. She was very solitary, even in a crowd, and she had strict rules about proper behavior. This meant not going into neighbors' gardens, sitting quietly for long times, and listening to radio programs she liked. She had friends, such as Mrs. Buddery, who liked the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who said little, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier. They talked about unimportant things like bad legs and cold weather, and I often felt included as an ungrateful child. I felt a heavy weight from my mother and her rules, and I wanted to grow up to be free. Growing up in West Earlham had a set pattern: until age five, I stayed home, and then I went to school. Some children had bikes, but I walked with others. I remember summer holidays when I saw an old man from the Merchant Navy and went to a charity fete. My mother thought the charity only wanted money. She often spoke about people being greedy and hated politicians. On Sundays, she sometimes took me to the Norwich Castle Museum to see paintings. She almost enjoyed it and once joked about a painting of a Roman soldier.","In the past, council houses extended across the western side of the city, consisting of rows of cramped, dull dwellings in orange half-brick or pale white stucco. During summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory two miles away created an indescribable sulphur smell around the doors and gardens, and it was common to see a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust while delivering papers. Most of my early life is forgotten, but I have a memory of sitting precariously near an upstairs window, watching the houses fade into the distance. Later, there are other vague memories, such as my mother ironing towels in a back room that might not have been ours, and snow falling over the turrets of a large mansion. My mother often appears in these memories; she was a small, precise woman who was nearly always angry, and I never understood the source of her anger. She was extremely solitary, feeling alone even in a room full of people, and she had a fanatical adherence to propriety that was uncommon in West Earlham. This led to furious spring-cleanings and rules like 'behave proper,' which included avoiding neighbors' gardens, sitting silently for long periods, and listening to her preferred radio programs. She had a few friends, including Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who mostly grunted in agreement, and Mrs. Laband, who was livelier and somewhat disapproved of by the others. This group engaged in depressing conversations about trivial topics, and I often felt like an ungrateful child. I felt as if a heavy weight of my mother, her friends, and the obligation to behave properly was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up to free myself. Growing up followed a regulated pattern: until age five, I stayed at home, often playing aimlessly while my mother sat frostily nearby, and then I was sent to Avenue Road infants school. A few lucky children had bikes with child seats, but I was entrusted to other children for the journey. I recall summer holidays, where I glimpsed life outside West Earlham, such as an old neighbor who told Merchant Navy stories and a charity fete where a woman offered lemonade and promoted the League of Pity. My mother dismissed it, believing the organizers were only after money. She frequently spoke of mercenary motives and held politicians in deep contempt, imagining the House of Commons as a place where rich people exploited the public. To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education and occasionally took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays, where we viewed paintings by the Norwich School artists. She nearly developed opinions on the art and once made a joke about a painting of a Roman soldier, which was a rare instance of humor from her.","In those days, council houses sprawled across the western side of the city: row upon row of huddled, dingy dwellings constructed from orange half-brick or pale white stucco.

It is unsurprising that my mother features prominently in these early recollections; I remember her as a small, precise, and nearly always angry woman, whose anger I never fully comprehended and thus could not appease. Even as a child, accompanying her on errands to Bunnett Square or into the city, I had some awareness of the oddity of her personality. She was profoundly solitary, as isolated in a crowded room as on a moor, and this solitariness was compounded by a fanatical adherence to a form of propriety uncommon in West Earlham, which occasionally manifested in furious spring-cleanings, handwashings, and injunctions to 'behave proper.'

Subsequently, other phantoms materialise—faces to which I cannot attach names, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that I suspect was not our own, snow descending over the turrets of the great mansion at Earlham. That my mother should intrude into these nascent memories is unsurprising; I recall her as a diminutive, precise, and nearly perpetually irate woman, the source of whose anger I never fully fathomed and, consequently, could not mitigate. Even in childhood, accompanying her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on more extensive excursions into the city, I am certain I possessed some intimation of the peculiarity of her personality. She was, for instance, arguably the most solitary individual I have ever encountered, as isolated in a room replete with people as on a desolate moor.

It was only subsequently that I apprehended the impoverishment of this trio's company; they constituted a depressed and depressing sisterhood, engaging in a meagre dribble of inconsequential discourse concerning bad legs, inclement weather, and the perils of ingrate children, a category in which I nearly invariably felt myself included. In retrospect, it was as if a colossal paperweight, composed of the West Earlham houses, my mother and her cronies, and the obligation to 'behave proper,' lay across my shoulders, and that it was my duty forthwith to mature and commence the labour of prising it free. This was more easily articulated than accomplished. Maturing in West Earlham during that epoch adhered to a well-regulated pattern.

285,"0ral History

The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian's social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia ('times were good then'), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, that is, in how the nerves, muscles and sense organs are coordinated to produce complex behaviour. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach, although they are often interested in the mechanisms of 'behaviour', study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Within the 'whole animal' approach, a distinction is often made between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists have traditionally worked in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists have been more concerned with the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals, often in their wild habitats. Although this distinction still exists to some extent, there is now a fruitful coming together of the two.
Among these types, it is the physiologists who like to emphasise that their methods are the more fundamental. However, even if we knew how every nerve cell operated in the performance of some pattern of behaviour, this would not remove the need for us to study it at a behavioural level also. Behaviour has its own organisation and its own units mat we must use for its study. Trying to describe the nest-building behaviour of a bird in terms of the actions of individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a page of a book with a high-powered microscope.

The Social Sciences

A problem facing all students who come to study a social science for the first time is that they must do two things simultaneously. They must familiarise themselves with the substance or content of their new subject and, at the same time, they must learn the methodology of the subject. That is, they must become familiar not only with the knowledge and research findings which fill the textbooks but also with the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised, that is with the logical basis of the subject itself. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related. Because we are all familiar with social life through our everyday experiences we may feel that the social sciences are very largely a matter of common-sense. But, as a look at any textbook will quickly indicate, though each of the social sciences is concerned with people in society, each discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, each uses particular methods of study and each employs its own set of concepts. It is this set of concepts, the most basic ideas in a subject, which constitutes the 'logical basis of the subject', which enables the social scientist to go beyond everyday common-sense and which distinguishes one discipline from another.

Classical Architecture

To the classical world, that of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings. 'Architecture', says the Roman architect Vitruvius, 'consists of Order, and of Arrangement, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Propriety and Distribution.' For several of these terms he gives a Greek equivalent: his definitions probably derived from an earlier Greek authority whose writings are lost to us. Utility and Function are not part of this definition, though in his book Vitruvius does go on to describe the best form and arrangements for different purposes of structure; but here, at the beginning, the aesthetic emphasis, architecture as an art, has priority. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was obviously a long prehistory of basic construction, of hut habitations simple in form and material, both in Greece and Italy, which did not match up to Vitruvius' artistic requirements. Though these were, by definition, inartistic they nevertheless contributed an essential element of form, which persisted into the later sophisticated architectural concepts. However orate it may appear from the outside, in essence the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.",C2,"Oral History: Historians use people's stories. But this has problems. People's memories are not perfect. The historian and the person talking affect each other. The person's memories can change from other things they heard or from their feelings. Animal Science: Scientists study animals in two ways. One way looks at how the body works. The other way looks at the whole animal and its behavior. Some scientists study learning in labs. Others study animals in the wild. Now they work together more. The Social Sciences: When you study social sciences, you learn two things at once. You learn about the subject and how to study it. It is not just common sense. Each subject has its own ideas and methods. Classical Architecture: In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than building. It was about beauty, order, and proportion. Early buildings were simple huts. Later, temples became beautiful but kept the simple hut idea.","Oral History: Historians often use oral evidence, but this can be problematic. A person's testimony is not a pure record of the past because the interview situation influences both people. The historian's presence and questions change how the informant remembers and speaks. Also, the informant's memories may be affected by media, nostalgia, or later feelings, which can make the story less accurate. Animal Science: There are two main approaches in animal science: physiology and the whole animal approach. Physiologists study how the body's parts like nerves and muscles work together. The whole animal approach focuses on behavior and its causes. Psychologists and ethologists are part of this; psychologists study learning in labs, while ethologists observe natural behavior. Today, these groups collaborate more. Even with detailed body knowledge, behavior must be studied on its own level. The Social Sciences: Students of social sciences must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. This includes understanding research findings and how knowledge is gathered. Social sciences go beyond common sense by using specific concepts and methods for each discipline, like sociology or psychology. Classical Architecture: In classical times, architecture in Greece and Rome was about artistic principles like order, arrangement, and symmetry, as described by Vitruvius. Although utility was considered, aesthetics came first. Early simple huts influenced later sophisticated designs, with temples essentially being refined versions of basic structures.","Oral History: The increasing use of oral evidence by historians presents several challenges. It is incorrect to assume that an informant's testimony is an exact account of past events, as the interview process affects both parties. The historian's role in selecting the informant and setting the topic influences the narrative, and the informant's memories can be altered by external sources like media or emotional factors such as nostalgia or grievance. Consequently, historians must acknowledge their part in shaping this evidence. Animal Science: Animal science is divided into physiological and whole animal approaches. Physiologists investigate how bodily systems coordinate to produce behavior, while those in the whole animal approach study the behavior of intact animals and its influencing factors. Traditionally, psychologists focused on laboratory studies of learning in species like rats, whereas ethologists examined innate behaviors in natural settings. Although distinctions remain, there is now productive integration between these fields. Physiologists claim their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior requires analysis at the behavioral level, not just cellular details. The Social Sciences: Students entering social sciences face the dual task of mastering the subject's content and its methodology. This involves familiarizing themselves with research findings and the logical foundations of how knowledge is acquired and organized. While social life is familiar from daily experience, social sciences employ specialized concepts and methods that surpass common sense, defining each discipline's unique approach. Classical Architecture: In classical antiquity, architecture encompassed more than construction; it emphasized aesthetic principles such as order, arrangement, and proportion, as outlined by Vitruvius. Although functional aspects were addressed, the artistic elements took precedence. The origins trace back to simple hut dwellings, whose basic forms persisted and evolved into the elaborate designs of classical temples.","Oral History: The trend of historians relying on oral evidence is fraught with difficulties. It is naive to believe that testimony provides an unadulterated record of past experiences, as the dynamic of the interview affects both the historian and the informant. The historian's selection process and analytical framework shape the evidence, and the informant's recollections may be compromised by influences from media, nostalgic idealization, or later-emerged grievances. Thus, historians bear responsibility for their role in evidence creation, and the informant's memories are not directly linked to the past but filtered through subsequent experiences. Animal Science: In animal science, two primary approaches exist: the physiological, which examines the coordination of nerves, muscles, and sense organs in behavior, and the whole animal approach, which studies behavior in its entirety and its determinants. Within the latter, psychologists traditionally investigate learning in controlled environments with specific species, while ethologists focus on innate behaviors in natural habitats. Although these distinctions persist, there is now a beneficial convergence. Physiologists emphasize the fundamentality of their methods, yet behavioral analysis remains essential, as behavior possesses its own organizational units that cannot be fully explained at the cellular level. The Social Sciences: Students of social sciences must concurrently acquaint themselves with the subject's substantive content and its methodological foundations. This entails understanding both empirical findings and the logical principles underlying knowledge acquisition and organization. Despite the familiarity of social phenomena, social sciences transcend common sense through discipline-specific concepts and methods, which facilitate deeper insights and distinguish one field from another. Classical Architecture: In the classical world, architecture was defined by aesthetic principles such as order, arrangement, proportion, and symmetry, as per Vitruvius, who prioritized artistic elements over mere utility. While functional considerations were later incorporated, the emphasis remained on art. The evolution from rudimentary hut structures in Greece and Italy contributed fundamental forms that endured in sophisticated architectural concepts, with classical temples essentially refining these simple origins.","Oral History: The burgeoning reliance on oral evidence among historians is not without inherent complications. It is erroneous to presume that an individual's testimony constitutes a pristine distillation of historical experience, given that the interview scenario mutually influences both participants. The historian's prerogative in selecting informants and delineating topics, coupled with their analytical paradigms, impinges upon the narrative, while the informant's memories may be adulterated by extraneous sources such as media or distorted by affective residues like nostalgia or grievances that crystallized post-factum. Consequently, historians must concede their complicity in the genesis of evidence, and the informant's recollections are not in immediate contact with the past but are mediated by subsequent psychological developments. Animal Science: Animal science is characterized by two principal methodologies: the physiological approach, which probes the mechanistic coordination of neural, muscular, and sensory components in comportment, and the whole animal approach, which scrutinizes the behavior of intact organisms and its modulators. Traditionally, psychologists have concentrated on associative learning in laboratory settings with constrained species, whereas ethologists have prioritized instinctive behaviors in ecological contexts. Although vestiges of this dichotomy endure, a synergistic amalgamation has emerged. Physiologists tout the fundamentality of their techniques, yet comprehending behavior necessitates examination at its own hierarchical level, as it embodies organizational structures irreducible to neurocellular operations. The Social Sciences: Novitiates in social sciences confront the exigency of assimilating both the epistemological content and the methodological underpinnings of their discipline. This involves acquainting themselves with extant research and the logical frameworks governing knowledge synthesis. While quotidian experiences render social phenomena seemingly intuitive, social sciences eclipse common sense through specialized conceptual apparatuses and investigatory methods, which not only facilitate transcending mundane understanding but also demarcate disciplinary boundaries. Classical Architecture: In classical antiquity, architecture transcended mere edification to encompass aesthetic tenets such as order, arrangement, proportion, and symmetry, as articulated by Vitruvius, who derived these from Hellenic sources. Although utilitarian aspects were subsequently addressed, the primacy of artistic expression was unequivocal. The provenance of classical architecture is intricate, with primitive hut constructions in Greece and Italy furnishing elemental forms that permeated later sophisticated idioms, wherein temples, despite their ornate exteriors, essentially epitomize refined iterations of rudimentary shelters.","0ral History

The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian's social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia ('times were good then'), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, that is, in how the nerves, muscles and sense organs are coordinated to produce complex behaviour. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach, although they are often interested in the mechanisms of 'behaviour', study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Within the 'whole animal' approach, a distinction is often made between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists have traditionally worked in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists have been more concerned with the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals, often in their wild habitats. Although this distinction still exists to some extent, there is now a fruitful coming together of the two.
Among these types, it is the physiologists who like to emphasise that their methods are the more fundamental. However, even if we knew how every nerve cell operated in the performance of some pattern of behaviour, this would not remove the need for us to study it at a behavioural level also. Behaviour has its own organisation and its own units mat we must use for its study. Trying to describe the nest-building behaviour of a bird in terms of the actions of individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a page of a book with a high-powered microscope.

The Social Sciences

A problem facing all students who come to study a social science for the first time is that they must do two things simultaneously. They must familiarise themselves with the substance or content of their new subject and, at the same time, they must learn the methodology of the subject. That is, they must become familiar not only with the knowledge and research findings which fill the textbooks but also with the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised, that is with the logical basis of the subject itself. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related. Because we are all familiar with social life through our everyday experiences we may feel that the social sciences are very largely a matter of common-sense. But, as a look at any textbook will quickly indicate, though each of the social sciences is concerned with people in society, each discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, each uses particular methods of study and each employs its own set of concepts. It is this set of concepts, the most basic ideas in a subject, which constitutes the 'logical basis of the subject', which enables the social scientist to go beyond everyday common-sense and which distinguishes one discipline from another.

Classical Architecture

To the classical world, that of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings. 'Architecture', says the Roman architect Vitruvius, 'consists of Order, and of Arrangement, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Propriety and Distribution.' For several of these terms he gives a Greek equivalent: his definitions probably derived from an earlier Greek authority whose writings are lost to us. Utility and Function are not part of this definition, though in his book Vitruvius does go on to describe the best form and arrangements for different purposes of structure; but here, at the beginning, the aesthetic emphasis, architecture as an art, has priority. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was obviously a long prehistory of basic construction, of hut habitations simple in form and material, both in Greece and Italy, which did not match up to Vitruvius' artistic requirements. Though these were, by definition, inartistic they nevertheless contributed an essential element of form, which persisted into the later sophisticated architectural concepts. However orate it may appear from the outside, in essence the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut."
286,"Music - The Challenge Ahead

Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work, at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain.

In the latter part of the 20th century, we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. Along with this, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians.
There seems little doubt that the widening access to music is likely to continue, fulfilling as it does so many human needs. On a national level, no major state occasion is without music. For individuals, it provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal.
Indeed, a society without music is surely unthinkable and it seems that the issue is not whether there will be music in the 21st century but what the nature of that music will be, and also whether there will be a continued perceived need for people to learn to play musical instruments.
I would respond to the latter question on a positive note. The music industry is one of the major generators of income in Britain and musical skill and talent will continue to be important in preparing individuals to work in a variety of professions, in particular those related to the media.
In addition to its vocational significance, there is a growing body of evidence that playing an instrument may be beneficial to the development of skills at an earlier stage. Research in the USA has suggested that listening to or actively making music has a direct positive effect on spatial reasoning, one aspect of the measurement of intelligence.
While these results are still to be successfully replicated, other data from Europe has indicated that an increase in group music lessons can have positive effects on social relationships in school and on concentration in young children and those with behavioural difficulties.
Taking the idea behind such findings one step further, current research is investigating to what extent playing an instrument may even encourage the development of transferable skills. For instance, the need to practise regularly may assist in the acquisition of good study habits and focused concentration, playing in concerts may encourage habits of punctuality and good organisation.
For all these reasons, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. What about the longer term picture? Is there likely to be a shift in focus and, if so, what direction will it take?
While there are many possible scenarios, I believe that two possibilities are likely. Firstly, the kinds of music to which people will listen will become more diverse. New genres will develop which will integrate different styles. Secondly, there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. This will widen access to composition as there will be less reliance on technical skill but at the same time, it is likely to further reduce the need for live performance and musicians whose role is solely related to it.
Developing in parallel with this trend is a likely increase in the number of people, across the whole age range, who wish to actively participate in music making. Such activities are likely to be community based and will reflect the musical traditions of that community whatever they may be.
If this vision of the future is to be realised, what does the music profession need to do in preparation? The focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. 
As a result, the impact on the instrumental curriculum and the measures used to assess progress through it will be such that they will need to adapt to maintain their relevance for a broader sector of the population. Ultimately, they will need to encompass a wider range of musical skills.
Crucial to the success of the process will be the training of musicians. They will need to be able to motivate, inspire and teach learners of all ages, develop skills for working with large and diverse groups and acquire the communication, social, entrepreneurial and management skills necessary for community work.
This represents a fundamental change from traditional practice and it will be accompanied by the need to respond to demands for public accountability. Viewed positively, this should provide an opportunity for all those involved in music education to demonstrate the high quality of music tuition available.
Finally, we need to strive towards raising the profile of music itself. Music plays a crucial role in our lives but all too often it is taken for granted. Those involved in the music profession at all levels need to work actively together to ensure that this changes.
",C2,"Technology changes our lives. It changes music too. In the past, people listened to music on radio, TV, and CDs. Now, less live music is played. Fewer musicians have full-time jobs. Music is important for big events and for people. It helps with work and learning. Playing an instrument can help children learn and behave better. In the future, more types of music will be made. Technology will help make music. More people will want to play music in their communities. Teachers need to teach in new ways. Musicians must learn to teach and work with others. We must show that music is important.","Technology is changing our lives, including music. In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music, like on radio, TV, and CDs. But live music and jobs for musicians decreased. Music is very important for national events and personal activities. It helps in jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can improve skills in children and help with social behavior. In the future, music styles will become more varied, and technology will be used more to create music. This may reduce the need for live performances. More people of all ages will join community music groups. Music teachers must adapt to teach more people. Musicians need training to inspire learners and work in communities. We should work together to make music more valued.","Technological advances are transforming many aspects of life, including music. In the latter part of the 20th century, opportunities to listen to music expanded through media like radio, TV, and CDs, while live music performances and full-time employment for musicians declined. Music fulfills essential human needs and is integral to national events and individual activities. It supports the economy and various professions, particularly in media. Evidence suggests that playing an instrument benefits skill development in children, such as spatial reasoning and social behavior. Future trends may include greater diversity in music genres and increased use of technology in composition, potentially reducing demand for live musicians. However, more people across age groups are expected to participate in community-based music making. To prepare, instrumental teaching must evolve to reach a broader audience, and musicians need training in motivation, teaching, and community engagement. Ultimately, efforts are needed to raise the profile of music in society.","Technological progress continues to reshape various facets of existence, including the domain of music. During the late 20th century, there was a rapid expansion in access to music via radio, television, records, and digital formats, accompanied by a decline in live performances and professional opportunities for musicians. Music serves critical functions on both societal and personal levels, contributing to national ceremonies and individual pursuits. It is a significant economic sector in Britain, and musical proficiency is valuable for careers, especially in media-related fields. Research indicates that instrumental practice can enhance cognitive abilities like spatial reasoning and improve social interactions and concentration in youth. Looking ahead, music is likely to diversify in style and incorporate more technology in creation and performance, which may further diminish the role of live musicians. Concurrently, participation in community music activities is expected to rise across all ages. This necessitates adaptations in instrumental education to cater to a wider demographic, with musicians requiring enhanced skills in pedagogy, group management, and community work. A collective effort is essential to elevate the recognition of music's importance.","Technological advancements persistently transform numerous dimensions of human experience, including the realm of music. In the latter part of the 20th century, a proliferation of listening opportunities emerged through mediums such as radio, television, and various audio formats, while live musical performances and full-time employment for professional musicians witnessed a concomitant decline. Music fulfills a multitude of human necessities, being indispensable for state occasions and affording individuals diverse formal and informal engagements. It constitutes a major income source in Britain, with musical expertise preparing individuals for vocations, particularly within the media sector. Accumulating evidence suggests that instrumental engagement may foster developmental benefits, such as enhanced spatial reasoning and improved social cohesion and focus among children. Prospective developments entail a diversification of musical genres and an increased reliance on technology for composition and performance, potentially exacerbating the reduction in live music demand. Nevertheless, a growing inclination towards active participation in community-based music making across all age cohorts is anticipated. Consequently, instrumental pedagogy must undergo reform to accommodate lifelong learners, necessitating curricular adaptations and assessments that maintain relevance. Musicians will require comprehensive training in motivation, instructional techniques, and community-oriented skills to address evolving demands. Ultimately, a concerted initiative is imperative to augment the prominence of music, which is often undervalued in contemporary society.","Music - The Challenge Ahead

287,"'You don't take sugar, do you? shouted his secretary, not so much asking a question as stating a fact - as well she might, because she had been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn't normally supposed to be there. Actually nowadays he was usually there all the time, having discovered that to take up his proprietorial privilege of staying away was tantamount to opening the floodgates. Not for the first time he pondered the easy, imperceptibly divided stages by which he had progressed from valued counsellor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch at carefully planned planning meetings complete with agenda, to hapless dogsbody moving one step ahead of catastrophe, with nowhere to park when he arrived at work in the mornings.
'This came,' she yelled, vaguely waving a manila folder before putting it down in front of him. 'From that chap in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it.' A typed label said: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Just under that it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see that word 'synopsis'. At the very least he wanted to see a label saying 'A First Draft'. Lancelot had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not really want to see another, however heavily revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given an advance of several thousands of pounds for this book during the initial flurry of activity when Lancelot had bought the firm. One of several old friends from whom Lancelot had made the capital error of commissioning books, Ian Cuthbert was a particularly flagrant proof that in such circumstances the possessor of a wayward temperament, far from nerving himself to behave more predictably for friendship's sake, will actually become less 'pindownable' than ever.
Lancelot skipped the blurb come preamble which he had read for what seemed like the hundredth time and sampled the synopsis proper. There was scarcely a phrase that he did not recognise at a glance. He closed the folder and shifted it to one side. Plainly at this rate Ian's manuscript would never be forthcoming. As well as almost wholly lacking the brilliance for which its author was supposed to be famous, the synopsis, under its doggedly frolicsome tone, had the unmistakable dead ring of a lost conviction. Lancelot remembered tales of a famous author-about-town whose last book, published incomplete after his death, had been coaxed from him chapter by chapter, one payment at a time. But in that case, the payments were fractions of a hypothetical advance which had never been given in the first place. Ian's advance had been enormous; a blatant reversal of the sound business principle by which authors must deliver a manuscript now in order to be paid with inflated currency later.
Lancelot, who had read modern languages at Oxford, could remember the day when Ian Cuthbert had been the most promising talent in a Cambridge so full of promise that it had made everywhere else feel provincial. Ian's contemporaries had plotted to take over the British theatre and in a remarkably short time they had actually done so. But their mental energy had seemed like indolence when you looked at Ian. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about what one very famous French writer had said as if he had been there to overhear it. Yet for some reason, the whole frostily coruscating galaxy of Ian's creative intellect had remained locked in its closet. While less gifted deviants came out and conquered, Ian went further in. At the height of his influence as a literary taste-maker he was already notoriously difficult to deal with. Officially appointed by the relevant public agency to edit a comprehensive magazine of the arts, he was like a general with a million tons of equipment pinned down on the beach by nothing except an excess of opportunity. The magazine used up the budget for a dozen issues without appearing once. Similarly, his thrice-renewed three-year contract with one of the fashion magazines engendered little except legends about the size of his emolument, which was increased from generosity to extravagance in an attempt to make him produce more, and then from extravagance to munificence in an attempt to make him produce anything. At the editorial working breakfasts - there were always at least two of the titled photographers present to capture the scene for posterity - Ian spat witty venom through clenched teeth, and poured nitric acid on other people's ideas. Ten years later, he could scarcely be depended upon to turn up for his own funeral. Lancelot was on the verge of admitting to himself that 'A World History of the Short' had been a mistake from its inception.",C2,"His secretary shouted, 'You do not take sugar, do you?'

She occasionally forgot such details because he wasn't ordinarily expected to be there, though in reality, he was now consistently present. He contemplated the gradual stages by which he had transitioned from a valued counsellor, engaging with authors in structured meetings, to an overburdened assistant perpetually averting disasters. His secretary presented him with a manila folder from an associate in Los Angeles, stating it was something he had requested. The folder was labeled 'A World History of the Short' by Ian Cuthbert, with 'An Expanded Synopsis' beneath. Lancelot was displeased to see 'synopsis' and would have preferred 'first draft'. Ian had received a substantial advance during the initial phase after Lancelot acquired the firm, and as one of several friends commissioned, Ian demonstrated an increasingly unpredictable nature. Lancelot perused the synopsis, recognized most of it, and dismissed it, concluding that Ian's manuscript would likely never materialize.

Ian's advance had been enormous; a blatant reversal of the sound business principle by which authors must deliver a manuscript now in order to be paid with inflated currency later.
Lancelot, who had read modern languages at Oxford, could remember the day when Ian Cuthbert had been the most promising talent in a Cambridge so full of promise that it had made everywhere else feel provincial. Ian's contemporaries had plotted to take over the British theatre and in a remarkably short time they had actually done so. But their mental energy had seemed like indolence when you looked at Ian. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about what one very famous French writer had said as if he had been there to overhear it. Yet for some reason, the whole frostily coruscating galaxy of Ian's creative intellect had remained locked in its closet. While less gifted deviants came out and conquered, Ian went further in. At the height of his influence as a literary taste-maker he was already notoriously difficult to deal with. Officially appointed by the relevant public agency to edit a comprehensive magazine of the arts, he was like a general with a million tons of equipment pinned down on the beach by nothing except an excess of opportunity. The magazine used up the budget for a dozen issues without appearing once. Similarly, his thrice-renewed three-year contract with one of the fashion magazines engendered little except legends about the size of his emolument, which was increased from generosity to extravagance in an attempt to make him produce more, and then from extravagance to munificence in an attempt to make him produce anything. At the editorial working breakfasts - there were always at least two of the titled photographers present to capture the scene for posterity - Ian spat witty venom through clenched teeth, and poured nitric acid on other people's ideas. Ten years later, he could scarcely be depended upon to turn up for his own funeral. Lancelot was on the verge of admitting to himself that 'A World History of the Short' had been a mistake from its inception."

Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, and the chances are they'll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations, from computers to encyclopaedias.
Most people know little of what Einstein did, except that he developed some mysterious theories under the heading 'relativity', which are famous for being incomprehensible, and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience.
Einstein was part of a gigantic leap forward in scientific thinking, an intellectual revolution that heralded the birth of twentieth century science. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature.
Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy. Previous descriptions had depended on Isaac Newton's view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

Young Readers

Throughout our childhoods, Lydia and I distrusted any prize-winning book because we knew it would be worthy; and for 'worthy', read 'boring', we thought.
While our mother had been inclined to abhor our philistinism in tones of despising innuendo, our father would cheerfully dish us out tenpences, chapter by chapter, as inducements to make us cast our eyes over the occasional improving volume. Or he would slip the odd superior book in amongst our Christmas and birthday presents, labelled in bold marker pen, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Though we dismissed most of his offerings as 'boys' books', he did, in this way, expose us to some shorter works of decent fiction and, just once, to a well-known anthology of verse.

Language

'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous', wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. The marvellous secret has long proved a launch pad for strange ideas. 'Primitive man was likely to make sounds like ""meuh"" when sensing danger,' claimed Charles Caller in 1928. ""Meuh"" has a plaintive sound. The human who wandered over a hostile land inhabited by awesome beasts uttered desperate noises, and languages have preserved some echo of his lamentation such as malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"".
Faced with such weird speculations, many avoided the topic, regarding it as a playground for cranks, but recently, language origin and evolution have become key research areas. Language probably developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. In the main speech was used for friendly interaction, and was an important tool in power struggles.

289,"Vervet monkeys

Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger's intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. If he succeeded, it was more than likely that the incumbent male would be ousted from his position of privilege. With the vervet equivalent of a stroke of genius, the male hit on the ideal ploy to keep the stranger away from his group. As soon as the strange male descended from the grove of trees to try to cross the open ground that separated his grove from the one in which the group was feeding, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to signal the sighting of a leopard nearby. The stranger shot back into the safety of his trees. As the day wore on, this was repeated every time the stranger made a move in the groups direction. All was going swimmingly until the male made a crucial mistake: after successfully using the ploy several times, he gave the leopard alarm call while himself nonchalantly walking across open ground.

What Cats Catch

In a recent survey, people in the 173-household English village of Felmersham collected their cats' prey. Over one year their seventy cats produced over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America saw these figures and worked out that on this basis the cat population of Britain must be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year!
The mesmeric effect of big numbers seems to have stultified reason. It is not realistic just to multiply the number of catches of these rural cats by the entire cat population of Britain. Most cats are town cats with small ranges, and catch fewer items of prey than the cats in this survey. The key question should have been this: are the numbers sustainable? The answer would seem to be yes.
In winter many householders feed birds, while garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, and in this way the bird population is kept at well above 'natural' levels. The survey found that the cat is a significant predator, but not that it is devastating Britain's bird population.

Buffalo's Day

The buffaloes are, as it were, the marshman's lifeline, and they are cherished accordingly. At each dawn the buffaloes, who have been sleeping on the buffalo platform or quite frequently round the fire with their owners, leave, infinitely slowly and wearily, their wallowing progress continually punctuated with despairing groans, for the distant reed beds beyond the open water. For a long time they stand on the edge of the platform, groaning to each other of the infinite fatigue of the coming day, until at last the leader takes a ponderous pace forward and subsides into the water.
Once in the water a deep lassitude once more descends upon the party, as if they had by now forgotten their intention and they may wallow there with low notes of complaint for many minutes. The movements that at length remove them from the immediate vicinity of the house are so gradual as to pass practically unnoticed, but finally they are swimming, so low in the water that their noses seem held above it by a last effort of ebbing strength, their rolling eyes proclaiming that this is the end at last and that they are drowning. So, patient and protesting and more or less submerged, they spend the day among the reeds and the bulrushes, grazing leisurely upon such green shoots as their antediluvian heads may find at eye level.

PICASSO, Pablo 

The soles 1940 Oil on canvas Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art

Picasso tended to paint those things that surrounded him, and in the early spring of 1940, he painted several fish still lifes while he was staying in the fishing port of Royan. The ostensible subject of the painting is a fishmonger's slab with a crab, and a pair of scales containing two or three soles. In spite of their predicament these sea creatures look very much still alive. It is not very easy to read the painting because Picasso has treated the composition in terms of a flat pattern of overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. This, the thin delicately brushed paint, and the cool, undemonstrative colours give the painting the appearance of an underwater world of slow-moving calm and harmony. But this is disturbed by what seems to be an impending battle between the fish, baring their teeth, and the crab, with its open claws. Those sharp, pointed forms are echoed by the scales. Even the chain going round one of the fish takes on a more sinister aspect. There is an undercurrent of menace and barely suppressed violence that gives the picture a symbolic edge.

I was ushered into the young man's drawing room, an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class.
Here was the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across and the astonishing evidence that a teenager existed who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures and furniture.
His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to read history, and he had nine months to kill before going up, during which time he intended to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers.
My own ambitions were just as insane as his, I wanted to be a pop star, for all the healthy reasons women, money and fame. The difference between Andrew and myself was that my dreams were never life or death to me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become so had I failed.
Consequently, when Andrew suggested a completely new insane ambition for me, i.e. to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no qualms about giving it a go. This was partly because within ten minutes of our introduction, he was at the piano and had played me three tunes he had composed -- I could tell that he was good. Very good.
As he confidently continued to bash out selections from some of the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of many of the best show albums from my parents LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world.
I had little to impress him with in return, other than instant praise for his music and a bona fide, actually released, seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) with which an unknown pop group had dealt the final blow to their moribund career by recording three months previously. We parted, promising to meet again and to write something together. I was still more interested in the charts than in the West End theatre, but told myself on the bus back to my flat that I had just met somebody of rare ability and determination, and I would be mad to miss out on being a sidekick to a chap who was clearly going to take the musical theatre by storm, probably by next week.
And even if the two of us failed to challenge the top musical composers successfully, then we could try to knock the Beatles and Rolling Stones off their perches later, in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would clearly be in need of some new material.
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a solicitor, the brief certainty I had enjoyed of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded somewhat. I would of course continue to keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist, and would turn out a few more three-chord songs tailored not to expose the limitations of my voice, but it was still odds-on that eventually I would stagger through my exams and wind up a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five.
By then I would have surely grown out of pop music as my father had confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying - if he was right I only had a few more months of enjoying it.
But in the meantime I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go and see a musical with him, to write words that aped musical lyricists rather than pop stars. And Andrew was a fascinating individual who talked of Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team.
I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical that he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was beyond question and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room.
The idea was the life of Dr Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was a worthy one indeed, but not one that truly fired my imagination. The hero was too squeaky-clean, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the enterprise was unoriginal in both conception and execution, owing far too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver.
On the other hand, Andrew's conviction of his score's precocious brilliance was infectious and not totally unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, later to be my agent for over a quarter of a century, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint.
I set to work with enormous enthusiasm, in particular for those songs that were intended to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes and in many instances gave me the title as well, most of which had presumably been thought up by his ex-wordsmith school pal who had already had a go. I skipped a day at the solicitors office, faking illness, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics. I did not know it that day but I had changed careers.",C2,"I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber. His room was very nice. He had many records and a good music player. He also had old glasses and furniture. He was going to study at Oxford University. He wanted to be a famous music writer like Richard Rodgers. I wanted to be a pop star for money and fame. Andrew played his music for me. It was very good. He asked me to write words for his songs. I said yes. I had written a song before, but it was not a big hit. We agreed to work together. I thought Andrew was very talented. I went back to my job as a trainee lawyer. I was not sure about my future in music. But I decided to see Andrew again. We talked about his idea for a musical about Dr. Barnardo, who helped orphans. I did not love the idea, but Andrew was sure it would be good. I started writing words for his songs. I missed a day of work to do this. I did not know it then, but I had started a new job.","I visited a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber. His drawing room was tidy and cultured, unlike the messy rooms of his family. He had a huge collection of records and the first stereo I had seen. He also owned Georgian wine glasses and old furniture. Andrew had won a scholarship to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford. Before starting, he wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I dreamed of being a pop star for women, money, and fame. My dreams were not as serious as his. Andrew played some tunes he wrote, and I thought he was very good. He suggested I become a lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein. I agreed because his music impressed me. I had only a small song I wrote that did not succeed. We promised to meet again and write together. I was more interested in pop music than theatre, but I knew Andrew was special. Back at my job training to be a lawyer, I felt less sure about a music career. I thought I might become a lawyer by age 25. But I decided to see Andrew again. He talked about food guides, architecture, and his football team. He had an idea for a musical about Dr. Barnardo, who started orphanages. I was not excited by the idea, but Andrew was confident. I started writing lyrics with enthusiasm, even skipping work one day. That day, I changed my career without knowing it.","I was shown into the drawing room of a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber. It was a calm, cultured space amid the disorganised rooms where his less ambitious family members spent time. Moving there felt like an upgrade. He owned an extensive record collection, the first stereo system I had encountered, and surprising items like Georgian wine glasses and antique furniture. Andrew had earned a scholarship to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford, and had nine months free before starting. During this time, he aimed to become England's equivalent of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own goal was to be a pop star, driven by desires for women, money, and fame. Unlike Andrew, my ambitions were not life-or-death matters. When he proposed that I become a lyricist as renowned as Oscar Hammerstein, I agreed readily because his musical talent was evident from the tunes he played for me. In return, I could only offer praise and a minor song I had written that failed to help an unknown band. We parted with plans to collaborate. Although I preferred pop music over theatre, I recognised Andrew's rare ability and determination. Back at my solicitor training job, my certainty about a show business career faded. I expected to eventually pass my exams and become a lawyer by age 25, as my father predicted I would outgrow pop music. However, I saw no harm in meeting Andrew again. He was fascinating, discussing topics like good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported Leyton Orient football club. His musical idea focused on Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a 19th-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. I found the concept unoriginal and uninspiring, but Andrew's confidence was contagious. With encouragement from my future agent's analogy about hamburger bars, I threw myself into writing lyrics, even taking a sick day from work. Unknowingly, I had embarked on a new career path.","I was ushered into the drawing room of Andrew Lloyd Webber, a sanctuary of cultured sanity amidst the rather shambolic surroundings of his family's less enterprising members. Transitioning from the kitchen to his parlour felt like an upgrade from economy to business class. He possessed the largest record collection I had ever seen, along with the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across, plus astonishing evidence of a teenager investing in Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. Andrew had secured a scholarship to read history at Magdalen College, Oxford, and with nine months to spare before commencing his studies, he intended to establish himself as England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers. My own aspirations were equally audacious; I desired pop stardom for the typical incentives of women, money, and fame. The distinction was that my dreams never felt as critical as his, though hindsight makes that easy to assert. When Andrew suggested I aim to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no reservations about attempting it, largely because within minutes of our meeting, he played three of his compositions on the piano, and I could discern his exceptional talent. As he confidently performed selections from school productions, I recalled the finest show albums from my parents' collection. He required a new lyricist for broader ventures. My own offerings were limited to immediate admiration and a bona fide seven-inch single of a song I had written, which had dealt a final blow to an obscure pop group's faltering career. We parted with promises to reunite and collaborate. While my interests leaned more towards the pop charts than West End theatre, I reflected on the bus home that I had encountered someone of rare ability and determination, and it would be foolish to forgo the opportunity to assist a person clearly destined to revolutionise musical theatre imminently. Even if we failed to rival top composers, we could later attempt to displace the Beatles and Rolling Stones, especially with the Everly Brothers' comeback suggesting a need for new material. The following day, back at my solicitor training desk, my brief certainty of a show business life with Andrew had diminished. I planned to continue monitoring ads in Melody Maker for vocalist opportunities and composing simple songs to mask my vocal limitations, but the likelihood was that I would eventually pass my exams and become a respectable lawyer by twenty-five, by which time I expected to have outgrown pop music as my father had predicted. This prospect was disconcerting, as it implied only a few months remained for my enjoyment. Nevertheless, I resolved to see Andrew again, anticipating the fun of attending a musical and writing lyrics in that style. Andrew was a captivating individual, conversing about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture while supporting Leyton Orient. I remained unconvinced by his musical concept, developed over the past year, but in 1965, I was seldom convinced about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he asserted having all the necessary contacts. The idea centred on Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded the orphanages named after him. Although his story was worthy, it failed to ignite my imagination; the hero seemed too pristine in Andrew's rendition, and the enterprise felt derivative of Lionel Bart's Oliver. However, Andrew's conviction in his score's precocious brilliance was infectious and not entirely unfounded. As my future agent David Land often remarked, if one hamburger bar thrives, there is room for another; we could be that second establishment. I embarked on the task with enormous enthusiasm, particularly for the comedic songs. Andrew outlined the plot, played the tunes, and provided many titles, likely conceived by his former school lyricist. I feigned illness to skip a day at the solicitors' office and wrote my first set of theatrical lyrics, unknowingly altering my career that day.","I was ushered into the drawing room of the young Andrew Lloyd Webber, an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms inhabited by the less enterprising members of his family.

Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult, but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols, who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange, unsettling sound would somehow, irrevocably, be linked with their destinies.
For Paul Simon, as for other youngsters in the US, the chief opportunity for hearing this new and invigorating type of music that was sweeping the country was courtesy of Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was required listening for a whole generation of fledgling rock idols. Like the young John Lennon, 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, with his ear glued to Radio Luxembourg - the only European outlet for the new rock and roll - Paul Simon was fascinated by the sounds pouring from Freed's show, and prepared himself for the next big step for a rock and roll obsessed teenager, the switch from listening to others' music to making his own.

Snow

No path was visible, but I thought that I would be all right if I walked with due caution. The wind hammered down from the heights, knocking me over as I slid and slithered on the slippery ice. Suddenly the innocent-looking snow gave way beneath me. I dropped, startled, into a hole some four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the gap between two rocks, melting away to leave nothing but a thin crust through which I had plunged. I hauled myself out, shaken and unnerved, wondering what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat back against the top of a pine tree that protruded from the snow to take stock of the situation. In an hour I had covered about half a mile. It was perfectly clear that I would have to abandon my plan.

Qualitative Research

There are now numerous books which attempt to give guidance to researchers about qualitative research. While much has been written about the collection of data, the books are often silent about the processes and procedures associated with data analysis. Indeed, much mystery surrounds the way researchers analyse their data. Accordingly, we invited a range of social scientists who have engaged in qualitative projects to discuss the approaches that they used. The idea was to share insight and understanding of the process of qualitative data analysis rather than to produce a guidebook for the intending researcher. Such a task involves a process of demystification, of making implicit procedures more explicit. While this may sound straightforward, we have found it far from simple. We have therefore given our contributors the opportunity to present their work in a range of styles, which include autobiographical narratives and more impersonal forms.",C2,"{'Paul Simon': ""Rock and roll music in the 1950s was for young people.

There are now numerous books which attempt to give guidance to researchers about qualitative research. While much has been written about the collection of data, the books are often silent about the processes and procedures associated with data analysis. Indeed, much mystery surrounds the way researchers analyse their data. Accordingly, we invited a range of social scientists who have engaged in qualitative projects to discuss the approaches that they used. The idea was to share insight and understanding of the process of qualitative data analysis rather than to produce a guidebook for the intending researcher. Such a task involves a process of demystification, of making implicit procedures more explicit. While this may sound straightforward, we have found it far from simple. We have therefore given our contributors the opportunity to present their work in a range of styles, which include autobiographical narratives and more impersonal forms."
293,"Self-help books

Dione Reverend was a mere editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr John Gray. 'I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,' she says, chuckling, and she was right. The desperately understanding Dr Gray is now a multimillionaire and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr Gray's slim volume on how to bridge communication gaps between the sexes is the unofficial mascot of a huge and expanding self-help industry that may, as its insiders claim, answer some of American's myriad yearnings for betterment. It also feeds off those yearnings, creates hundreds more and - not incidentally - props up the entire world of New York publishing.
As Britain is learning, the genre can fill entire polls with tomes os quackish and histrionic as their covers - but there are worse. For every self-help title published, thousands are rejected as too derivative or specialised. This is no small mercy. As a new breed of heavyweight editor-cum-ogent goes looking for the next lightweight blockbuster, prose style is the lost thing on anybody's mind. Marketability is everything. 'How promotable is the author? What's the ""hook'? Is it universal enough?' Ms Reverend rattles off the key questions, then admits: 'If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.'

Autobiographies

There has to be a tacit understanding, a pact, between an autobiographer and reader that the truth is being told. Such at pact is, I would guess, rarely observed to the full. There are many reasons why the writer should lapse. There may be actions or thoughts which he feels it is simply too shameful to make public. There may be things he decides against putting down on paper because (as he rationalises) they are not important enough. There are also more complex and interesting reasons for surreptitiously breaking the pact. The autobiographer may decide that the ultimate goal of the work, the truth about himself, can be served by inventing stories that encapsulate the truth more neatly, more pointedly than strict adherence to the facts ever could. Or he may break the pact by deciding, from the beginning, never to adhere to it. He may call his book an autobiography simply in order to create a positive balance of credulity in the reader's mind that will be extremely convenient for him in his storytelling, and which, in the case of his more naive readers, may not be exhausted even by the time the story ends, so that these readers will go away thinking they have read a true history, when they have read nothing but a fiction. All of which can be done in no particular spirit of cynicism.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories

Students of the detective story have explained the flourishing of this genre as an expression of the conflicts of late nineteenth and early twentieth century society. The detective story is essentially an allegory. The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society, its lawless impulses quelled so that society can again function smoothly. In Hammett's peculiar version, society is returned to its former state, but that itself is shown to be corrupt and false.
The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's tales are two aspects of the same personality. The private eye and his prey understand each other and are, in a strange way, comfortable with each other. The private eye has a foot in each camp. From the point of view of the criminal he is a bit too straight, and from that of the law a bit too seedy. He is at once a crook and a competitor. The mission of the private eye is sometimes tempered by his sense of complicity, and sometimes his punitive zeal is intensified by his anxiety about this ambiguity.

SCIENCE WRITING

Today's greatest scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss that art and hear his advice, I met him in an unfamiliar milieu: at the Grand Hotel (where he was staying while promoting his new book). Neither of us, it has to be said, felt much at home. As for writing a piece set in surroundings of such lifeless self-aggrandisement, Gould said: 'I couldn't do it: Trollope might but he knew the culture. And knowing the culture is central to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is a civilisation of its own. As a result, only scientists can make a good job of presenting it. If you don't live in the community and don't understand its rules, you are crippled from the start.'
One of Gould's axioms is: never write down to the reader. 'Make no concessions,' he says. 'You can simplify the language but must never adulterate it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers notice that they are being patronised, your piece is dead.'",C2,"Self-help books: Dione Reverend worked at a book company. She saw a book by Dr. John Gray. She knew it would sell well. It did. Dr. Gray is now rich. Dione has her own company. The book helps people talk better. Many people want to get better, so they buy these books. This helps the book industry. In Britain, some self-help books are not good. For every book published, many are not chosen. Editors want books that sell. They ask: Is the author famous? Is the idea good? A good title is very important.

Autobiographies: When someone writes about their life, they should tell the truth. But often, they do not. They might not tell bad things. They might think some things are not important. Sometimes, they make up stories to show the truth better. Or they say it is true when it is not. This can make readers believe it is true, even if it is not.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: These stories are popular. They show problems in society. The crime is like bad human feelings. Solving the crime makes society better. In Hammett's stories, society is still bad. The detective and the criminal are similar. The detective is not all good or all bad. He understands criminals. This makes his job hard.

Science writing: Stephen Jay Gould is a great science writer. I met him in a hotel. We did not like it there. He said writers must know the culture they write about. For science, only scientists can write well about it. They know the rules. Gould says: Do not write too simply for readers. Use simple words but keep the ideas hard. If readers feel you think they are stupid, they will not like it.","Self-help books: Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York. She found a manuscript by Dr. John Gray, a pop psychologist. She thought the title would make it a bestseller, and she was correct. Dr. Gray became a multimillionaire, and Dione started her own company. His book helps with communication between men and women. It is part of a big self-help industry that answers people's desires to improve. This industry also creates more desires and supports New York publishing. In Britain, self-help books can be silly, but many are rejected for being unoriginal. Editors look for books that will sell well. They consider if the author is promotable and if the idea is universal. A catchy title is very helpful in reaching people.

Autobiographies: There is an agreement that autobiographers should tell the truth, but this is often not fully followed. Writers might omit shameful actions or thoughts, or leave out things they think are unimportant. Sometimes, they break the agreement in more complex ways. They might invent stories to show the truth more clearly than facts can. Or, they might call the book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can happen without bad intentions.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: Experts say detective stories grew from societal conflicts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The stories are allegories where crimes represent human impulses like lust or greed. Solving the crime restores order to society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown as corrupt. The detective and criminal are two sides of the same person. The detective understands criminals and is partly like them, making his role ambiguous and his mission complicated.

Science writing: Stephen Jay Gould is a top science essayist. I met him at a grand hotel, and neither of us felt comfortable. Gould believes writers must understand the culture they write about. For science, only scientists can present it well because they know its rules. He advises never to write down to readers. Simplify the language but not the arguments. If readers feel patronized, the writing fails.","Self-help books: Dione Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she discovered a manuscript by the unknown pop psychologist Dr. John Gray. She immediately knew from the title that it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Dione has her own company. His book on improving communication between genders is a symbol of the large and growing self-help industry, which addresses Americans' many desires for self-improvement. However, it also exploits those desires, creates new ones, and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre includes many exaggerated books, but worse ones exist. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too derivative or niche. Editors now focus on marketability, asking about the author's promotability and the book's universal appeal. A catchy title is crucial for success.

Autobiographies: There is an implicit pact between autobiographers and readers that the truth will be told, but this is rarely fully honored. Writers may omit actions or thoughts they find too shameful or unimportant. More interestingly, they might break the pact by inventing stories that better convey the truth than strict facts would, or by labeling fiction as autobiography to gain readers' trust. This can lead naive readers to believe they have read a true account, even if it is entirely fabricated, and it may not be done cynically.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: Scholars explain the popularity of detective stories as reflecting societal conflicts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These stories serve as allegories, with crimes symbolizing innate human impulses like lust or greed, and their resolution restoring social order. In Hammett's work, however, society is depicted as inherently corrupt. The detective and criminal represent two aspects of the same personality, with the detective straddling both worlds. This ambiguity affects his mission, sometimes moderating it due to complicity or intensifying it from anxiety.

Science writing: Stephen Jay Gould is considered the greatest scientific essayist today. I met him at the Grand Hotel, where we both felt out of place. Gould emphasized that successful writing requires deep cultural knowledge; for science, only insiders can effectively present it. He insists on not simplifying arguments for readers, as patronizing them ruins the work, though language can be made accessible.","Self-help books: Dione Reverend, then an editor at Random House in New York, encountered a manuscript by the then-unknown pop psychologist Dr. John Gray. She instantly recognized from the title that it would become a number one bestseller, and her prediction proved accurate. Dr. Gray has since amassed considerable wealth, and Dione now operates her own company. His concise volume on bridging communication gaps between the sexes epitomizes the vast and expanding self-help industry, which purportedly addresses numerous American aspirations for betterment. Concurrently, it capitalizes on these yearnings, generates additional ones, and sustains the New York publishing sector. In Britain, the genre often features melodramatic and dubious titles, though many are worse. For each self-help book published, thousands are dismissed as overly derivative or specialized. As a new class of influential editor-agents seeks the next popular hit, literary quality is overlooked in favor of marketability. Key considerations include the author's promotability, the conceptual hook, and universality, with a compelling title being a significant advantage in engaging audiences.

Autobiographies: An implicit understanding exists between autobiographers and readers that the narrative will be truthful, yet this pact is seldom entirely upheld. Authors may exclude actions or reflections deemed too humiliating or trivial. More nuanced reasons for deviation include fabricating anecdotes that encapsulate truths more effectively than factual accuracy or deliberately labeling a work as autobiography to foster reader credulity. This can result in unsuspecting readers accepting a fictional account as veracious, a practice not necessarily rooted in cynicism.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: Analysts of the detective genre attribute its proliferation to the tensions within late 19th and early 20th century society. Essentially allegorical, these stories use crime to symbolize fundamental human drives such as lust or greed, with the resolution traditionally signifying societal reintegration and suppression of unlawful impulses. Hammett's unique approach, however, reveals society as corrupt even after order is restored. The detective and criminal in his narratives embody dual facets of a single psyche, with the detective occupying an ambiguous position between legality and criminality. This duality influences his pursuits, sometimes mitigating his resolve through a sense of involvement or heightening it due to unease over his equivocal role.

Science writing: Stephen Jay Gould stands as the preeminent scientific essayist of our time. I interviewed him at the Grand Hotel, an environment where neither of us felt at ease. Gould contends that adept writing necessitates immersion in the relevant culture; for science, only those within the scientific community can authentically convey it, as outsiders are inherently disadvantaged. He advocates for avoiding condescension towards readers by simplifying language without diluting complex arguments, asserting that perceived patronization irrevocably undermines the work's integrity.","Self-help books: While serving as an editor at Random House in New York, Dione Reverend first perused a manuscript by the hitherto obscure pop psychologist Dr. John Gray. She discerned from the title alone that it would ascend to the pinnacle of bestseller lists, a conviction that materialized accurately. Dr. Gray has since become a multimillionaire, and Reverend has established her own enterprise. His slender treatise on ameliorating intersexual communication deficits functions as the unofficial emblem of an extensive and burgeoning self-help industry, which ostensibly caters to America's multifarious aspirations for enhancement. Nevertheless, it also preys upon these yearnings, engenders further desires, and, not incidentally, buttresses the entirety of New York's publishing domain. In Britain, the genre can inundate shelves with volumes as quackish and histrionic as their covers, though inferior examples abound. For every self-help title that reaches publication, multitudes are spurned for excessive derivativeness or overspecialization. As a novel breed of heavyweight editor-cum-agent pursues the next lightweight blockbuster, prose style is the least of considerations; marketability predominates. Inquiries into an author's promotability, the conceptual 'hook,' and universality are paramount, with a resonant title constituting a substantial portion of the competitive edge in audience engagement.

Autobiographies: A tacit compact necessitates that autobiographers relate veracious accounts to their readership, yet this covenant is infrequently observed in its entirety. Omissions may arise from actions or cogitations deemed too ignominious for public disclosure or rationalized as insufficiently significant. More intricate and compelling rationales for surreptitious breaches include contriving narratives that distill truth more elegantly and pointedly than rigid adherence to facts permits, or, from the outset, eschewing veracity entirely by designating a work as autobiography to cultivate a reservoir of credulity in the reader. This stratagem can endure throughout the narrative, leaving ingenuous readers convinced of its historicity despite its fictional nature, all potentially executed devoid of cynicism.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: Connoisseurs of the detective narrative interpret its efflorescence as a manifestation of fin de siècle and early twentieth-century societal dissonances. The genre operates fundamentally as allegory, wherein criminal acts symbolize innate human proclivities such as lust or avarice, and their denouement, in conventional iterations, signifies the personality's reintegration with society and the quelling of anarchic impulses. Hammett's idiosyncratic rendition, however, restores society to a status quo that is itself exposed as mendacious and corrupt. The hunter and the hunted in his oeuvre represent dichotomous aspects of a unified psyche; the private investigator and his quarry exhibit mutual comprehension and an odd symbiosis. The detective straddles both spheres, perceived by criminals as excessively upright and by the law as somewhat disreputable, embodying both rogue and rival. His mission is occasionally tempered by an awareness of complicity, while at other times, his punitive ardor is amplified by disquiet regarding this ambiguity.

Science writing: The paramount contemporary exponent of scientific essays is Stephen Jay Gould. To deliberate on this craft and solicit his counsel, I convened with him in an incongruous setting—the Grand Hotel, where he lodged during promotional activities for his latest publication. Neither of us, it must be conceded, felt particularly at home. Gould asserted that composing a piece set in such sterile, self-aggrandizing environs was infeasible for him, noting that while Trollope might have succeeded due to cultural familiarity, such insight is indispensable for efficacious writing. He posits that science constitutes a distinct civilization, thereby necessitating that its expositors be ensconced within the community to grasp its conventions; otherwise, they are fundamentally impaired. One of Gould's cardinal principles is to eschew condescension: make no concessions beyond linguistic simplification, never adulterate the substance, and above all, refrain from simplifying the argumentation, as readers' detection of patronization spells the demise of the composition.","Self-help books

294,"Advertising on trial

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic, hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years.
In Britain, it meant in 1991 alone that while gross domestic product (GDP) declined, interest rates remained punitively high, consumer spending on almost everything other than staples fell, more than half a million people lost their jobs, and some 75,000 homes were repossessed.
Every single business in the country was affected, some - the vehicle and building trades - finding themselves 30 per cent down. A lot of people - a lot of companies - in a lot of countries suffered. Of course, advertising people are scarcely unique in losing their jobs in such difficult times, but of all those still in employment, they often feel particularly under pressure.
Seen, as they are, to spearhead efforts to support the bottom line, they suppose themselves to be under close enough scrutiny from their colleagues, let alone their bosses. Moreover, they are also faced with the very considerable problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets. They have been told that less must be more.
And yet, alongside these psychological and financial imperatives lies an almost paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The notion that companies should be making sure they are producing services and goods that their customers want, as opposed to merely what it is convenient for them to provide, is not a new one. Still, it's scarcely unfair to say that it has been only over the past ten or fifteen years that many companies seem to have put the idea intentionally, rather than fortuitously, into practice.
The consequences have been that marketing activities have at last begun to be given the attention they deserve by management, that these people have acquired a little learning about the subject, and that a few brands have actually begun to be genuinely marketed.
All these things have pleasingly increased the status of marketing people, while simultaneously adding to their burden. Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there's some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people. It is certainly true that if the 80s was the decade in which advertising never had it so good, the start of the 90s saw the industry enduring its worst downturn for a generation. This was, of course, partly a direct consequence of the economic climate at the time.
However, there was also evidence of more deep-seated change which would not simply be waved away as, and when, economic prospects brightened. The fact was that while this recession naturally caused potential clients to review, reconsider and often cut their budgets at the time, it also made them examine more closely than ever before the economics of advertising.
And, generally, in the absence of concrete, convincing and quantitative evidence to the contrary, they had to conclude that the benefits of advertising might be questionable. At a time when enthusiasm to account for every dollar spent was naturally high, it was simply not clear enough to many client companies exactly what they were getting for the large sums of money they were spending, exactly what return they were seeing on their investment. Advertising - ever a business to excite the suspicions of the sceptic - was, as a consequence, more than ever before on trial.
Thus, client companies almost everywhere took the view of one of their leaders quoted in the British trade magazine Campaign: 'We want better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, better media placement, better thinking. We aim to ensure we get advertising agencies' best people on our business and then ensure they are motivated to work their fingers to the bone, producing outstanding work for us.'
Now, while none of this should elicit sympathy for a thoroughly tough business, it does mean that many of those advertising people still in work continue to face precisely the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less. If this is, in itself, sufficiently trying, a number of other factors have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult.
Some of these are a direct consequence of the recession discussed earlier: the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take the sort of risks that are ironically often the essence of good advertising. Other events would have happened irrespective of local or global economic conditions.
These include, for example, the dramatic demographic changes facing much of the West, the burgeoning power of the retailer, the changing needs and desires of consumers, the rise of sponsorship, the increasingly onerous legal restrictions on advertising. And, of course, for some companies there is the new challenge of advertising abroad. Together with the economic situation, it is these matters which have forced many of those responsible for advertising to revisit Lord Leverhulme's commonplace that: 'Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half.' Because now more than ever before, the pressure is on to increase the proportion of advertising that works.
It is not terribly surprising that, at the moment, help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available. Generally, companies and the advertising agencies they use have been far too busy simply coping with these circumstances to wish to talk or write about them, while those that have succeeded in keeping their heads above water are often understandably anxious to keep the secrets of their success to themselves.
This means that while conferences and seminars may provide some useful information, the books currently available on advertising, and how to do it, really don't. Those that are available tend to treat the process of producing advertising with too much respect. To give the impression that the work advertising agencies produce is invariably of the highest quality, deeply considered and remarkable value for money, is neither true nor likely to help those employees of the client company who are ultimately responsible.",C2,"Advertising in the 1990s was very hard for people who work in advertising. The economy was bad. Many people lost their jobs. Companies spent less money on advertising. But companies thought marketing was more important. They wanted to make things that people want to buy. Advertising people had to do more work with less money. They felt a lot of pressure. Companies were not sure if advertising worked well. They wanted better ideas and work from advertising agencies. Other problems made advertising difficult, like new laws and changes in what people like. It was hard to know which advertising worked. Not much help was available for this.","In the early 1990s, working in advertising was very difficult. There was a big economic recession. Many people lost their jobs, and companies had less money to spend. Advertising agencies had to do their jobs with smaller budgets. At the same time, companies started to focus more on marketing, which means making products that customers want. This made advertising more important, but also harder. Companies were not sure if advertising was worth the money. They asked for better strategies and creativity from agencies. Other challenges included new laws, changes in consumer habits, and the need to advertise in other countries. It was hard to tell which advertising was effective, and there was not much help available.","The early 1990s were a tough period for those in the advertising industry. A severe economic recession hit many countries, leading to job losses and reduced spending. Advertising agencies faced pressure to achieve more with smaller budgets, while marketing gained importance as companies focused on meeting customer needs. This increased the status of marketing but added to the workload. Clients began to question the value of advertising, demanding better strategies and creativity. Additional difficulties arose from factors like demographic shifts, stricter regulations, and global advertising challenges. As a result, there was a strong need to improve the effectiveness of advertising, but useful guidance was scarce, as successful companies often kept their methods private.","During the early 1990s, the advertising industry experienced significant challenges due to a prolonged and severe economic recession. This downturn resulted in high unemployment and reduced consumer spending, forcing advertising agencies to operate with diminished budgets while facing heightened expectations. Concurrently, marketing gained prominence as businesses increasingly prioritized producing goods and services aligned with consumer demands. However, this elevation in status came with added pressures, as clients scrutinized advertising's return on investment and demanded superior strategies and creativity. Other complicating factors included demographic changes, regulatory constraints, and the complexities of international advertising. Consequently, the industry struggled to identify which advertising efforts were effective, with limited resources available to address these issues, as insights were seldom shared openly.","The advent of the 1990s presented formidable challenges for the advertising sector, exacerbated by a recession that was more protracted and severe than anticipated, profoundly impacting industrialized nations. This economic climate led to declining GDP, punitive interest rates, and substantial job losses, compelling advertising professionals to navigate intensified pressures with reduced financial resources. Paradoxically, the perceived significance of marketing escalated during this period, as companies increasingly adopted customer-centric approaches, thereby enhancing the stature of marketing personnel while augmenting their responsibilities. Clients subjected advertising to rigorous scrutiny, questioning its efficacy and insisting on enhanced strategic precision and creativity. Furthermore, the industry contended with deep-seated shifts such as demographic transformations, burgeoning retailer influence, and onerous legal restrictions, all of which necessitated a re-evaluation of advertising's effectiveness. Despite these imperatives, comprehensive guidance remained elusive, as entities successful in weathering the downturn were often reticent to divulge their methodologies.","Advertising on trial

Now, while none of this should elicit sympathy for a thoroughly tough business, it does mean that many of those advertising people still in work continue to face precisely the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less. If this is, in itself, sufficiently trying, a number of other factors have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult.
Some of these are a direct consequence of the recession discussed earlier: the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take the sort of risks that are ironically often the essence of good advertising. Other events would have happened irrespective of local or global economic conditions.
These include, for example, the dramatic demographic changes facing much of the West, the burgeoning power of the retailer, the changing needs and desires of consumers, the rise of sponsorship, the increasingly onerous legal restrictions on advertising. And, of course, for some companies there is the new challenge of advertising abroad. Together with the economic situation, it is these matters which have forced many of those responsible for advertising to revisit Lord Leverhulme's commonplace that: 'Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half.' Because now more than ever before, the pressure is on to increase the proportion of advertising that works.
It is not terribly surprising that, at the moment, help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available. Generally, companies and the advertising agencies they use have been far too busy simply coping with these circumstances to wish to talk or write about them, while those that have succeeded in keeping their heads above water are often understandably anxious to keep the secrets of their success to themselves.
This means that while conferences and seminars may provide some useful information, the books currently available on advertising, and how to do it, really don't. Those that are available tend to treat the process of producing advertising with too much respect. To give the impression that the work advertising agencies produce is invariably of the highest quality, deeply considered and remarkable value for money, is neither true nor likely to help those employees of the client company who are ultimately responsible."
295,"POETRY RECITALS

At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it, and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. It is fairly safe to say that, at the present time, there is an especially bewildering complexity of poetic tendencies, of kinds of poetry being written, of warring factions, of ways of presenting, criticising and teaching poetry, and of conflicting beliefs about the role of the poet in society. 
Very broadly speaking, the present debate in contemporary poetry concerns the reciprocal mistrust and disapproval shown by the seriously committed 'literary' writers, whose poems are intended to be printed and read on the page, and the 'popular', performing poets who, while they will probably publish their verses in magazines and collections, are happier declaiming them to an audience. Of course, this division is far from absolute.
The practice of promoting public poetry readings has been steadily increasing over the past twenty years or so, in many different forms. Small literary societies in provincial towns conduct them in village halls or the sitting rooms of their members; schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to audiences of students; arts festivals often advertise poetry readings by well-known authors on their programmes. The consequences of all these events, and of poets being more or less obliged to become public performers, are manifold and of uncertain benefit to them as mists.
For the 'pop' poets, whose work has been composed expressly for the purpose of recital to live audiences, the issue is plain. They can only profit from public performance. Their verses are often very simple in both form and content, and can be assimilated at a single hearing; it is on the printed page that the deficiencies of thought, technique and imagination become clear. Poets who are dedicated to their craft, and are doing their best to continue and develop what is finest in the traditions of poetry - which involves compressing the maximum amount of passion, thought, wit and vision into the smallest possible space and achieving rhythmic effects of great variety and subtlety -- are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience which is probably encountering their work for the first time. The danger here is, not that they will be tempted to emulate the content and style of the entertainers, but that they might, in the effort to achieve instant communication, read only their most readily accessible work which is quite likely to be their slightest and least characteristic. 
Attendance at poetry reading cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page, though it can be an enjoyable and instructive adjunct. To hear good poets read their work aloud, even if they are not accomplished public speakers, is a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken. The principal justification for popular recitals of poetry, where the readings are sometimes interspersed with musical items (jazz and poetry used to be a very popular mixture), is that audiences will come to associate poetry with pleasure and not feel that it is an art available only to an initiated minority. 
",C2,"People write poems. Some poets read their poems to people. Other poets want people to read their poems in books. It is hard to know which poems are good now. In the future, people will know. Many poets read poems to groups. This happens in schools, festivals, and small places. Some poets write simple poems for reading aloud. Other poets write deep poems for reading in books. When poets read aloud, people can enjoy it. But it is best to read poems in books too. This helps people like poetry.","Poetry today has many different styles. Some poets write for books, and some write for reading to audiences. It is confusing now, but later people will see which poems are important. Poetry readings are common. They happen in schools, festivals, and local groups. Poets who perform often write simple poems. Poets who write for books make complex poems with deep ideas. When poets read aloud, it can be fun. But to understand the poems well, people should read them in books. This makes poetry enjoyable for everyone.","The current poetry scene is complex, with various types of poets. Some focus on literary works for reading, while others prefer performing for live audiences. This diversity makes it hard to judge poetry now, but history will clarify it. Poetry readings have become more popular in places like schools and festivals. Performance poets benefit from recitals with their straightforward poems, but serious poets may not be fully appreciated in such settings. Hearing poets read can enhance understanding, but it should complement reading the text. Overall, recitals help make poetry accessible and pleasurable to a wider audience.","Contemporary poetry is marked by a bewildering array of tendencies and conflicting approaches, particularly between literary poets who write for the page and performing poets who recite to audiences. This division, though not absolute, reflects broader debates about poetry's role. The rise in public poetry readings over recent decades, occurring in various venues, has mixed effects. Performance poets gain from recitals due to their accessible work, whereas serious poets risk presenting only their simpler pieces. While attending readings is a valuable supplement, it cannot replace the depth gained from reading poetry on the page, ultimately promoting poetry as an enjoyable art for all.","The literary landscape of poetry is currently characterized by a perplexing complexity of competing factions and methodologies, with a notable tension between committed literary authors, who intend their work for printed consumption, and popular performing poets, who favor declamation to live audiences. This dichotomy, while not absolute, underscores the contemporary debate over poetry's societal function. The proliferation of public poetry readings in diverse settings has multifaceted implications; performance poets, crafting verses for oral delivery, benefit directly, whereas serious poets may compromise their artistic integrity in pursuit of immediate audience engagement. Although recitals serve as an instructive adjunct, they are no substitute for the nuanced appreciation afforded by textual study, thereby fostering a broader, more inclusive appreciation of the art form.","POETRY RECITALS

296,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark, motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day. When he had first bought the flat, he used to come home in an eager, questioning mood - often as early as he could -- wondering what it had been doing during the hours he had been away. It had represented a form of welcome to him, a region in which his focus was undisputed and reliable. He supposed that he should have worried about intruders or burst drains in that moment of reunion, but his flat had always been sitting waiting for him with an expression of independence or of neglect, depending on whether he'd left it tidy or not. In the end he had begun to regard it merely as another cloistered annexe of himself, a space into which the stuffy chambers of his heart and head had gradually overspilled their contents.
He had grown impatient with its inability to be transformed. There was, of course, the small, angular puddle of letters which sometimes gathered by the door and the red eye of the answering machine which could occasionally be found resuscitated and blinking with life when he returned. And he was grateful that the glassy eyes of his windows hadn't been smashed nor the contents ravished with violence, mind you, he wondered what the flat would look like afterwards.
From the dreary distance of his shabby third-floor office on the Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four solitary evenings at home each week. Once he had fled the fabricated world of the office and felt the memory of himself begin patchily to return on his bus journey home, he no longer needed to be on his own, a fact which seemed continually to elude him in his social calculations. Sitting exposed at his desk he would crave isolation, unlimited time alone amongst his possessions, but the relief of escape drained him and he would vainly wait for some sense of selfhood to return. Instead, there was merely a resounding emptiness, which made him suspect during his long hours of loneliness that the alien exercise of doing work which did not suit him had forced him to change, moving him further and further from what he liked to think of as himself. He would often read or listen to music as the night deepened outside, familiar habits which now, however, he would find himself asking for whom or what he did them. His points of reference had grown dim, his signposts muddied: sensations and ideas would arrive and then get lost, circulating around the junctions of his mind, unable to find a connection.
There had been a time, he supposed, when he had not felt this powerless, when, had he but perceived his own worth, he might have escaped; but he had been so eager to fix himself up with something that he had been swept along by this great desire for something, and he had followed the first course which presented itself as if it had been ordained that he should do so.
He had tried, of course, after he left university, to formulate some plan for his own betterment, but it hadn't really surprised him to find, when he searched himself for ambition, merely the desire unobtrusively to survive. He had applied for the types of jobs which had become familiar to him though the talk of his peers, had latched himself wearily on to their futures and jogged behind as they rushed towards them, unable to imagine that he might be put to some use which would manufacture as its by-product his own happiness.
He had attended his only interview gratefully, and in the fever of examination did not think to test the position - an inexplicit editorial role on a free local newspaper for its own merits. Relieved at having pulled off twenty minutes of pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, he had not considered the future of lengthy encounters by which he was now daily assaulted.

297,"Art on TV

Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera, which has the ability to show a whole work of art, then move in close to examine the details. Yet I can think of few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of looking at them.
A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

Dealing in Metals

For 20 years I worked as an international metals dealer and gained something of a reputation as a speculator. Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into allegations made against one of the multinational conglomerates that benefit from these cheap raw materials.

Extract from a Holiday Brochure

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas that stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer, to Cuba. Each one has its own personality, each one has something to offer.
The key to getting anywhere in the islands and cays of Abaco is a boat. If you don't get one thrown in with the room don't worry. Be happy. There are ferries galore. And water-taxis. Or, there are plenty of boats to rent if you prefer to go under your own steam.
But sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason.
Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that gems can be found. At night it's the lights of the restaurants and cafes of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay that sparkle.",C2,"Art on TV: TV shows about art are often not good. Art like paintings should be easy for TV to show. But few shows make art fun and interesting to watch. Example: A show called American Visions by Robert Hughes. He is a good art expert. The show talks about American history in art, not just the art itself. Dealing in Metals: I worked with metals for 20 years. I bought and sold metals to make money. Metals are risky, but you can earn a lot. Now, metal prices are lower. I looked into problems with a big company that uses cheap metals. Holiday Brochure: Abaco is part of the Bahamas islands. There are many islands. Each island is different. You need a boat to travel there. You can take ferries or rent a boat. Sailing is very popular. The water is good for fishing, diving, and swimming. The beaches are beautiful. At night, the lights in towns like Hope Town are pretty.","Art on TV: Television often fails in programs about visual arts. Painting and sculpture should work well on TV because cameras can show the whole artwork and its details. But I remember few series that show the joy and difficulty of looking at art. For example, Robert Hughes's series American Visions. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he had eight hours to teach British people about American art. I thought it would focus on great artworks, but it was about how American history and culture appear in art and buildings. Dealing in Metals: For 20 years, I was an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. Metals have fewer rules than other markets. With luck, risk-taking, and market knowledge, you can make much money. Risk is normal in this job. This fits with a free-market economy. But now, economists who said markets would keep metal prices high are wrong. More minerals are mined, and raw material costs are falling. Considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of 20 years ago. Recently, I checked claims against a big company that uses these cheap materials. Holiday Brochure: Abaco and its small islands are in the Bahamas, which has 700 islands from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and things to do. To travel around Abaco, you need a boat. If your room doesn't include one, don't worry—there are many ferries and water-taxis, or you can rent a boat. Sailing is the top way to get around here, and Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World'. The calm waters are great for fishing, diving, snorkelling, and swimming. The islands and beaches stretch 200 miles like pearls. Not just the sea has gems; at night, the lights of Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly.","Art on TV: Television consistently underperforms in its coverage of visual arts. Paintings and sculptures should be ideal for television, as cameras can display an entire piece and then zoom in on details. However, I can recall few television series that successfully communicate both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A clear example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, American Visions. Hughes is a reliable critic with an engaging personality, and he was given nearly eight hours to introduce British audiences to an art movement that British galleries have completely overlooked. I anticipated the series would concentrate on masterpieces, but instead, it explored how American history and culture are mirrored in its art and architecture. Dealing in Metals: I spent 20 years as an international metals dealer and built a reputation as a speculator. Metals are subject to far less regulation than other markets. With some luck, a readiness to take risks, and a solid grasp of market dynamics, it is possible to earn substantial profits. Risk-taking is an integral part of the industry, and this adventurous culture aligns well with a global free-market economy. However, free-trade economists who argued that the market would sustain prices of scarce metals have found the opposite occurring. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is declining. When inflation is accounted for, the prices of most metals are approximately half what they were two decades ago.

Holiday Brochure: Abaco and its offshore cays form part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, extending from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its distinct personality and offers unique attractions. The essential means of transportation in the Abaco islands and cays is a boat.

298,"Food

There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know
I may be preaching to the converted, because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one, but so often we imagine that, unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish, it is hardly worth attempting. Not so. Just by throwing a few roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery and a few herbs into water you will get the most delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a tin. Instead of buying an over-sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, emulsifiers and additives, in five minutes you can turn out the most delicious confection that both grown-ups and children will love.
Cooking is also an offering, and it is a gesture of care and love to bring once own creation, however humble or simple, to the table. Sharing food is so rich in symbolism, of our deepest human needs, that it is hardly surprising all our festivities and celebrations take place around tables, be they birthdays, anniversaries, engagements or whatever! No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! Nor would many people wish to have a business deal discussed over tinned soup.

In the Elevator

This morning, Alistair had made a stab at straightening up his office, but correspondence still littered every surface. Quarterly tax forms, state and federal, bulged out of desk drawers and cardboard boxes, all waiting on a day when he was in the filing mode. And then there was all the added paperwork that went along with owning an apartment building. The hundred-odd books and a few years' worth of journals were only in proximity to the new bookshelves.
As the elevator bore him closer to his floor, he knew that Mallory would be on time for their appointment. She would be knocking on the door of his empty office on the hour, not a second before or after. She was as compulsive about time as she was about neatness.
How would she react to the mess? She might assume he'd been vandalised. He could walk in behind her and feign shock.
Mrs Wilson, his cleaning woman, had arrived while he was scrambling around on the floor, trying desperately to clear a few square feet of the carpet. Putting his head out of the office door as she was turning her key in the lock of his apartment, he had smiled at her, his eyes filled with hope. Her own eyes had turned hard. Fat chance I'm going in there, said the back of her head as she had disappeared into his residence, which was her territory and all that she might be held accountable for.
He knew Mrs Wilson believed him to be a visitor from somewhere else, perhaps some point straight up, miles out, but nowhere on the surface of her own earth, which was square and shaped by the streets of Brooklyn.

KAREN

It was a simple desire - not to be like her mother - that led Karen to create her own story, her own mythology, a mythology of difference and strength. Tn the tale that she constructed for herself, there were significant moments in her progress; such as the day she was twelve years old and her brother quick-swung a golf club behind him and hit her full in the eye. At the first moment of impact, she was convinced of immediate blindness. But the bone hod protected her, as the doctor from the high-walled house later assured her. The golf club had clean missed the eye and she was left with only a few stitches that healed to a pole drawing of past suffering. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's white-walled consulting room, overlooking the tennis courts, ond saw her mother clear before her, muttering predictably and paradoxically about both miracles and small mercies, she knew that she was saved for some purpose.

Miss Fogerty

Miss Fogerty, returning briskly to her duties across the wet grass of the village green, was both excited and saddened by the scene she had just witnessed. It is always exhilarating to be the first to know something of note, particularly in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's quiet life held little excitement. On the other hand, her grief for Dr Bailey's condition was overwhelming. He has attended her for many years and she remembered with gratitude his concern for her annual bouts of laryngitis which were, fortunately, about the only troubles for which she had to consult him.
His most valuable quality, Miss Fogerty considered, was his making one feel that there was always plenty of time, and that he truly wished to hear about his patients' fears and perplexities. It was this quality, above all others, which had so endeared the good doctor to the village and its environs. He had always been prepared to give -- of his time, of his knowledge, and of his humour. His reward had been outstanding loyalty and affection.",C2,"Food is important. We like to eat good food. You can make soup with carrots, leek, celery, and herbs. It is easy and tasty. It is better than soup from a packet or tin. You can make a chocolate mousse in five minutes. It is good for children and adults. Cooking shows you care. We eat together for birthdays and parties. We do not eat takeaway food for big parties. In the elevator, Alistair's office is messy. He has many papers and books. Mallory will come on time. She likes things neat. He thinks she will not like the mess. Mrs. Wilson cleans his home. She thinks he is strange. Karen did not want to be like her mother. When she was twelve, her brother hit her eye with a golf club. She did not go blind. The doctor helped her. She saw her mother and felt strong. Miss Fogerty saw something sad. She was excited to know a secret. She was sad about Dr. Bailey. He was a good doctor. He helped her with her throat problems. He listened to people. Everyone liked him.","Food is a basic part of life and can be very satisfying. Many people think cooking is hard, but it is not. For example, you can make delicious soup with simple vegetables like carrots, leek, celery, and herbs. This is much better than buying soup in a packet or tin. Also, you can make a tasty chocolate mousse quickly without bad additives. Cooking is a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important for celebrations like birthdays or anniversaries. People do not use takeaway food for special events. In the elevator, Alistair's office was untidy with papers and books everywhere. He knew Mallory would arrive exactly on time because she is very punctual. He worried she would think his office was a mess. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaner, saw the office and did not want to clean it. She thought Alistair was from a different world. Karen wanted to be different from her mother. When she was twelve, her brother accidentally hit her eye with a golf club. She thought she was blind, but the bone protected her eye. After seeing her mother talk about miracles, Karen felt she had a purpose. Miss Fogerty felt both excited and sad. She was happy to know a secret in her village, but she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for years and always had time to listen to her problems. People loved him for his kindness.","Our connection with food is fundamental and rewarding. Although many believe cooking is only for special occasions, it is often simple and worthwhile. For instance, combining roughly chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water can produce a delicious soup, which is more satisfying than processed options. Similarly, a homemade chocolate mousse without preservatives can be made quickly and enjoyed by all. Cooking acts as an offering, expressing care and love through even humble dishes. Sharing meals is symbolic of human needs, which is why celebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries revolve around dining together; takeaway food is unsuitable for such events. In the elevator, Alistair reflected on his disorganized office, cluttered with correspondence, tax forms, and books. He anticipated Mallory's punctual arrival and her likely disapproval of the mess. Earlier, Mrs. Wilson, his cleaner, had refused to enter the office, viewing Alistair as an outsider from another place. Karen's desire to differ from her mother shaped her personal story. A key moment occurred at age twelve when her brother struck her eye with a golf club. Initially fearing blindness, she was relieved that the bone had shielded her eye, leaving only minor scars. In the doctor's office, seeing her mother speak of miracles reinforced Karen's sense of purpose. Miss Fogerty returned from an event feeling both excited and sorrowful. She was thrilled to be among the first to learn significant news in her small community, but overwhelmed with grief over Dr. Bailey's condition. As her long-time doctor, he had always shown genuine interest in her health issues, like her annual laryngitis, and his willingness to listen had earned him deep affection from everyone.","The relationship with food is deeply elemental and gratifying. While it might seem that cooking is reserved for elaborate dishes or special events, this is not the case; even a simple soup made from roughly chopped carrots, leek, celery, and herbs can be immensely satisfying and superior to commercial products. Likewise, creating a homemade chocolate mousse free from additives in just five minutes provides a delightful treat for both adults and children. Cooking serves as an act of offering, embodying care and love through one's creations, no matter how modest. The symbolism of sharing food reflects core human needs, explaining why festivities like birthdays and anniversaries are centered around meals, where takeaway or canned options are deemed inappropriate. In the elevator, Alistair contemplated his office's disorder, with correspondence littering surfaces and tax forms overflowing from drawers. He expected Mallory to arrive precisely on time, given her compulsiveness about punctuality and neatness, and considered how she might react to the chaos. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaner, had earlier declined to tidy the office, perceiving Alistair as an alien figure from beyond her familiar Brooklyn world. Karen's aspiration to distinguish herself from her mother led her to craft a personal mythology of strength. A pivotal incident at age twelve involved her brother accidentally hitting her eye with a golf club; though she initially feared blindness, the bone had protected her eye, resulting only in stitches that healed into a faint reminder. Upon seeing her mother in the doctor's office, Karen felt destined for a greater purpose. Miss Fogerty, returning across the village green, experienced a mix of excitement and sadness. She was exhilarated to be privy to noteworthy information in her quiet community, yet profoundly grieved by Dr. Bailey's condition. Having been her physician for years, he consistently demonstrated a valuable quality: making patients feel he had ample time to address their fears and perplexities, which endeared him to the village through his generosity and humor.","There is something profoundly elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I acknowledge that I may be addressing an audience already convinced, as those interested in cooking likely purchase books such as this, yet we often erroneously assume that unless it is a special occasion or an intricate dish, cooking is scarcely worth the effort. This is a misconception; merely by combining roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery, and a few herbs in water, one can produce a most delicious soup, far more rewarding than resorting to packaged or tinned alternatives. Similarly, instead of consuming an oversweet chocolate mousse laden with preservatives, emulsifiers, and additives, in a mere five minutes one can create a delectable confection adored by both adults and children. Cooking constitutes an offering and a gesture of care and love, bringing one's own creation, however humble, to the table. The act of sharing food is rich in symbolism, touching upon our deepest human necessities, which elucidates why all our festivities and celebrations—be they birthdays, anniversaries, engagements, or other events—transpire around tables; no one would consider takeaway for a wedding or anniversary, nor would many wish to discuss business over tinned soup. In the elevator, Alistair had attempted to straighten his office, but correspondence still cluttered every surface, with quarterly tax forms, both state and federal, bulging from desk drawers and cardboard boxes, awaiting a day when he felt inclined to file them. The additional paperwork from owning an apartment building compounded the disorder, and his books and journals were merely proximate to new shelves. As the elevator ascended, he knew Mallory would be punctual for their appointment, knocking on his door precisely on the hour, reflecting her compulsiveness regarding time and neatness. He pondered her potential reaction to the mess, considering she might assume vandalism, and thought of feigning shock upon entering behind her. Earlier, Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning woman, had arrived as he scrambled to clear a section of carpet; when he smiled hopefully from the office door, her hardened expression and retreat into his apartment—her domain—conveyed her refusal to engage, as she perceived him as a visitor from an entirely foreign realm, perhaps directly above but not part of her own earth, shaped by Brooklyn's streets. Karen's simple desire to avoid emulating her mother propelled her to construct her own narrative, a mythology of difference and resilience. In this self-fashioned tale, a significant episode occurred when she was twelve: her brother swiftly swung a golf club behind him, striking her fully in the eye. Initially convinced of immediate blindness, she later learned from a doctor in a high-walled house that the bone had protected her, with the club cleanly missing the eye and leaving only stitches that healed into a pale sketch of past suffering. Upon opening her eyes in the doctor's white-walled consulting room, overlooking tennis courts, and seeing her mother muttering paradoxically about miracles and small mercies, Karen felt assured she was preserved for some purpose.

299,"THE WELL

I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole, one could see the stars, if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched, eyes wide, fist to mouth, as I winched up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I had not thought to allow for the bucket's much increased weight, your lack of strength or inclination to just stand back and let what would happen, happen. You held the handle, taking some of the strain as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well's stone surround. Freed of the wall's support, I plunged immediately. You gave a little shriek and made one attempt to brake the handle, then you let it go. I fell into the well. I cracked my head.
It did not occur to me then that I had succeeded, in a sense, in my plan. What I saw were lights, strange, inchoate and bizarre. It was only later that I connected the visual symptoms of that fall and impact with the stylised stars and planets I was used to seeing drawn in a cartoon panel whenever a comic character suffered a similar whack.
At the time I was at first just dazed, then frightened, then relieved, then finally both angry at you for letting me fall and afraid of what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was all right. I opened my mouth to shout, and then you called again, a note of rising panic in your voice, and with those words stopped mine in my throat. I lay still, eyelids cracked enough to watch you through the foliage of lashes. You disappeared, calling out for help. I waited a moment, then quickly hauled and pushed my way to the top, then pulled myself over the edge and landed on the courtyard cobbles.
I could hear raised, alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the opposite way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows there.
Mother and Father both appeared along with you and old Arthur; Mother shrieked, flapping her hands. Father shouted and told Arthur to haul on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked, watching. I was bowed in the shadows. A fire of fierce elation filled me. Then I saw the line of drops I'd left, from the well to where I now stood. I looked in horror at the spots, dark coins of dirty well water fallen from my soaking clothes on to the dry, grey cobbles. At my feet, in the darkness, the water had formed a little pool.
I looked back into the courtyard, to where Father was now shining a flashlight down into the well and peering into the gloom. The drops I had left shone in the sunlight. I could not believe that nobody had seen them. Mother was screaming hysterically now, a sharp, jarring noise that I had never heard before. It shook my soul, suffused my conscience. What was I to do? I had had my revenge on you, but where did I go from here?
This had quickly become more serious than I'd anticipated, escalating with dizzying rapidity from a great prank born of a brilliant brainwave to something that would not be put to rest without some serious, painful and lasting punishment being inflicted on somebody, almost certainly myself. I cursed myself for not thinking this through. From crafty plan, to downfall, to wheeze, to calamity; all in a few minutes.
The plan came to me like a lifebelt to a drowning man. I gathered all my courage and left my hiding place, coming staggering out and blinking. I cried out faintly, one hand to my brow, then yelled out a little louder when my first cry went unheeded. I stumbled on a little further, then collapsed dramatically on the cobbles.
Sitting up, comforted, my head in my weeping mother's bosom, I went 'Phew' and said 'Oh dear' and smiled bravely and claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and crawled and swum along it until I got out, climbed up the bridge and tottered, exhausted, through the passageway.
To this day I think I was almost getting away with it until Father appeared squatting in front of me. He had me repeat my story. I did so, hesitating. His eyes narrowed.
Thinking I was plugging a gap, in fact only adding another log to my pyre, I said that the secret passage had fallen in after me; there wouldn't be any point in, say, sending somebody down to look for it. In fact the whole well was dangerous. I'd barely escaped with my life. I looked into my father's eyes and it was like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars at the end.
It was as though he was seeing me for the first time, and as though I was looking down a secret passage through time, to an adult perspective, to the way the world and cocky, lying children's stories would look to me when I was his age.
My words died in my throat. 'Don't be ridiculous, boy,' he said, investing more contempt in those few words than I'd have thought a whole language capable of conveying. He rose smoothly to his feet and walked away.
Arthur looked down at me, his expression regretful and troubled, shaking his head or looking like he wanted to, not because I had had a terrifying adventure and then been unjustly disbelieved by my own father, but because he too could see through my forlorn and hapless lie, and worried for the soul, the character, the future moral standing of any child so shameless - and so incompetent - in its too easily resorted-to lying.
In that pity was a rebuke as severe and wounding as that my father had administered, and in as much that it confirmed that this was the mature judgement of my actions and my father's, not some aberration I might be able to discount or ignore, it affected me even more profoundly.",C2,"I read that you can see stars from a deep hole on a clear day. I asked you to help me. You watched as I got into the well bucket. I told you to lower me down. But you were not strong enough, and I fell. I hit my head. I saw lights and felt dizzy. I was scared and angry at you. You called for help. I climbed out and hid. My parents came. I saw water drops from my clothes. I was afraid. I came out and pretended I was hurt. I said I found a secret tunnel from the well. My father did not believe me. He was angry. I felt bad.","I had read that from a very deep hole, you could see stars if the day was clear. I convinced you to help me. You watched as I climbed into the well bucket and asked you to lower me. But you could not hold it, and I fell into the well. I hit my head and saw strange lights. I felt dazed, then scared, and angry at you for letting me fall. You called down to me, but I did not answer. I climbed out and hid in the shadows. My parents and others came, worried. I saw water drops from my wet clothes on the ground. I decided to pretend I had escaped through a secret tunnel from the well. I came out and told my story. My father did not believe me and was very angry. I felt ashamed.","I had read that from a sufficiently deep hole, one could see the stars on a clear day. I persuaded you to assist me with my plan. You watched as I entered the well bucket and instructed you to lower me down. However, you lacked the strength to control it, and I fell into the well, hitting my head. Initially, I saw bizarre lights and felt a mix of emotions: dazed, frightened, and angry at you. When you called out in panic, I remained silent and then climbed out to hide. My parents arrived with others, and I observed them from the shadows. Noticing water drops from my clothes, I feared discovery. To avoid blame, I emerged and fabricated a story about escaping via a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. My father questioned me and saw through my lie, expressing contempt. I realized my deception was foolish and felt deeply ashamed.","I had read that from a sufficiently deep hole, one could observe the stars if the day were clear. I persuaded you to aid me in my scheme; you watched as I climbed into the well bucket and requested that you lower me. Unfortunately, you were unable to manage the weight, and I plummeted into the well, striking my head. In the aftermath, I experienced disorientation and saw peculiar lights, which I later connected to cartoon depictions of stars from impacts. Emotions shifted from fear to anger towards you for releasing the handle. When you called out anxiously, I chose not to respond, climbed out stealthily, and concealed myself. Upon seeing my parents' distress and the trail of water drops I had left, I devised a plan: I emerged, feigned injury, and claimed to have escaped through a secret passage from the well. My father, however, detected the falsehood in my account and dismissed it with scorn, leaving me to confront the gravity of my actions and feel profound regret.","Having read that from a sufficiently deep hole, one could discern the stars on a clear day, I persuaded you to assist me with my scheme. You observed, wide-eyed, as I winched up the well bucket, steadied it, and climbed in, then instructed you to lower me. I had failed to account for the bucket's increased weight and your lack of strength or willingness to maintain control; consequently, I plunged into the well upon your release of the handle, resulting in a head injury. Initially dazed, I perceived strange, inchoate lights, only later associating them with stylised stellar representations from cartoons. My emotions evolved from fear to resentment towards you, and when you called out in mounting panic, I remained silent, climbed out covertly, and hid. Witnessing my parents' alarm and the incriminating trail of water droplets, I experienced a surge of elation followed by dread. To extricate myself, I staged a dramatic emergence, feigning exhaustion and inventing a tale of escape through a secret tunnel from the well. My father, however, saw through my fabrication with palpable contempt, forcing me to acknowledge the immaturity of my deceit and the severe judgement of my character, which affected me profoundly.","THE WELL

I had read somewhere that from a sufficiently deep hole, one could see the stars, if the day were clear. I had persuaded you to help me with my scheme; you watched, eyes wide, fist to mouth, as I winched up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I had not thought to allow for the bucket's much increased weight, your lack of strength or inclination to just stand back and let what would happen, happen. You held the handle, taking some of the strain as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well's stone surround. Freed of the wall's support, I plunged immediately. You gave a little shriek and made one attempt to brake the handle, then you let it go. I fell into the well. I cracked my head.
It did not occur to me then that I had succeeded, in a sense, in my plan. What I saw were lights, strange, inchoate and bizarre. It was only later that I connected the visual symptoms of that fall and impact with the stylised stars and planets I was used to seeing drawn in a cartoon panel whenever a comic character suffered a similar whack.
At the time I was at first just dazed, then frightened, then relieved, then finally both angry at you for letting me fall and afraid of what Mother would say. You called down, asking if I was all right. I opened my mouth to shout, and then you called again, a note of rising panic in your voice, and with those words stopped mine in my throat. I lay still, eyelids cracked enough to watch you through the foliage of lashes. You disappeared, calling out for help. I waited a moment, then quickly hauled and pushed my way to the top, then pulled myself over the edge and landed on the courtyard cobbles.
I could hear raised, alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the opposite way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows there.
Mother and Father both appeared along with you and old Arthur; Mother shrieked, flapping her hands. Father shouted and told Arthur to haul on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked, watching. I was bowed in the shadows. A fire of fierce elation filled me. Then I saw the line of drops I'd left, from the well to where I now stood. I looked in horror at the spots, dark coins of dirty well water fallen from my soaking clothes on to the dry, grey cobbles. At my feet, in the darkness, the water had formed a little pool.
I looked back into the courtyard, to where Father was now shining a flashlight down into the well and peering into the gloom. The drops I had left shone in the sunlight. I could not believe that nobody had seen them. Mother was screaming hysterically now, a sharp, jarring noise that I had never heard before. It shook my soul, suffused my conscience. What was I to do? I had had my revenge on you, but where did I go from here?
This had quickly become more serious than I'd anticipated, escalating with dizzying rapidity from a great prank born of a brilliant brainwave to something that would not be put to rest without some serious, painful and lasting punishment being inflicted on somebody, almost certainly myself. I cursed myself for not thinking this through. From crafty plan, to downfall, to wheeze, to calamity; all in a few minutes.
The plan came to me like a lifebelt to a drowning man. I gathered all my courage and left my hiding place, coming staggering out and blinking. I cried out faintly, one hand to my brow, then yelled out a little louder when my first cry went unheeded. I stumbled on a little further, then collapsed dramatically on the cobbles.
Sitting up, comforted, my head in my weeping mother's bosom, I went 'Phew' and said 'Oh dear' and smiled bravely and claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and crawled and swum along it until I got out, climbed up the bridge and tottered, exhausted, through the passageway.
To this day I think I was almost getting away with it until Father appeared squatting in front of me. He had me repeat my story. I did so, hesitating. His eyes narrowed.
Thinking I was plugging a gap, in fact only adding another log to my pyre, I said that the secret passage had fallen in after me; there wouldn't be any point in, say, sending somebody down to look for it. In fact the whole well was dangerous. I'd barely escaped with my life. I looked into my father's eyes and it was like looking into a dark tunnel with no stars at the end.
It was as though he was seeing me for the first time, and as though I was looking down a secret passage through time, to an adult perspective, to the way the world and cocky, lying children's stories would look to me when I was his age.
My words died in my throat. 'Don't be ridiculous, boy,' he said, investing more contempt in those few words than I'd have thought a whole language capable of conveying. He rose smoothly to his feet and walked away.
Arthur looked down at me, his expression regretful and troubled, shaking his head or looking like he wanted to, not because I had had a terrifying adventure and then been unjustly disbelieved by my own father, but because he too could see through my forlorn and hapless lie, and worried for the soul, the character, the future moral standing of any child so shameless - and so incompetent - in its too easily resorted-to lying.
In that pity was a rebuke as severe and wounding as that my father had administered, and in as much that it confirmed that this was the mature judgement of my actions and my father's, not some aberration I might be able to discount or ignore, it affected me even more profoundly."
300,"AESTHETICS

By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. In common conception, the work of art is often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. Since the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience, the result is not favourable to understanding. In addition, the very perfection of some of these products, the prestige they possess because of a long history of unquestioned admiration, creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When an art product once attains classic status, it somehow becomes isolated from the human conditions under which it was brought into being and from the human consequences it engenders in actual life experience.
When artistic objects are separated from both conditions of origin and operation in experience, a wall is built around them that renders almost opaque their general significance, with which aesthetic theory deals. Art is remitted to a separate realm, where it is cut off from that association with the materials and aims of every other form of human effort and achievement. A primary task is thus imposed upon one who undertakes to write upon the philosophy of the fine arts. This task is to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings that are universally recognised to constitute experience. Mountain peaks do not float unsupported, they do not even just rest upon the earth. They are the earth in one of its manifest operations. It is the business of those who are concerned with the theory of the earth, geographers and geologists, to make this fact evident in its various implications. The theorist who would deal philosophically with fine art has a like task to accomplish.
If one is willing to grant this position, even if only by way of temporary experiment, one will see that there follows a conclusion which is at first sight surprising. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time, to turn aside from them and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. For theory is concerned with understanding and insight. It is, of course, quite possible to enjoy flowers in their coloured form and delicate fragrance without knowing anything about plants theoretically. But if one sets out to understand the flowering of plants, one is committed to finding out something about the interactions of soil, air, water and sunlight that condition the growth of plants. 
In order to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw, in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear, arousing one's interest and affording enjoyment as one looks and listens. Yet so extensive and subtly pervasive are the ideas that set art itself upon a remote pedestal that many people would be repelled rather than pleased if told that they enjoyed their casual recreations, in part at least, because of their aesthetic quality.The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts: for instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events. For, when what they know as art is relegated to the museum and gallery, the unconquerable impulse towards experiences enjoyable in themselves finds such outlet as the daily environment provides. Many people who protest against the museum conception of art still share the fallacy from which that conception springs. For the popular notion comes from a separation of art from the objects and scenes of ordinary experience that many theorists and critics pride themselves upon holding and even elaborating. The times when select and distinguished objects are closely connected with the products of usual vocations are the times when appreciation of the former is most rife and most keen.
",C2,"Aesthetics is about art and beauty. Art is made by people. But sometimes, people think art is only the thing you see, like a painting or a building. This makes it hard to understand art. Art should be part of our daily life. For example, movies and music are art that people enjoy every day. To understand art, we need to look at simple things in life that we like.","Aesthetics is the study of art and beauty. Art works, such as paintings or books, exist in the real world. But people often see art as separate from human experience, which makes it difficult to understand. When art becomes too perfect or famous, it can stop new ideas. Art should be connected to everyday life. For instance, movies and jazz are forms of art that many people enjoy without calling them art. To understand art, we should start with ordinary experiences that we find interesting and enjoyable.","Aesthetics deals with art and beauty. Artworks are physical objects, but people often identify them only as separate items, not as part of human experience. This separation hinders understanding. Additionally, when art becomes a classic, it can lose its connection to the conditions that created it and its impact on life. This builds a barrier that makes art seem distant. Therefore, a key task in art theory is to reconnect art with everyday experiences. For example, just as mountains are part of the earth, art should be seen as part of daily life. To understand art, we must sometimes ignore the artworks themselves and focus on common experiences. Many people enjoy things like movies or jazz without realizing they are art, because art is often confined to museums. True appreciation comes when art is linked to ordinary life.","Aesthetics involves the theory of art and beauty. The existence of artworks as physical objects can obstruct aesthetic theory because they are often viewed in isolation from human experience. When art attains classic status, it becomes detached from its origins and real-life effects, creating conventions that block fresh insights. This separation renders art's general significance opaque. Consequently, a primary task for art theorists is to restore continuity between refined artistic experiences and everyday events. Analogously, mountains are not separate from the earth but are manifestations of it. To comprehend art, one must temporarily set aside artworks and consider ordinary experiences that are not typically deemed aesthetic. Theory requires understanding through indirect means. Many vital arts, such as cinema or jazz, are not recognized as art by the average person, as art is frequently relegated to museums. Appreciation is most profound when esteemed objects are connected to common vocations and experiences.","Aesthetics concerns the philosophy of art and beauty. Ironically, the very existence of artworks, upon which aesthetic theory is based, can become an impediment to that theory, as these works are often perceived merely as external, physical entities divorced from human experience. This misconception arises because the actual work of art is defined by its interaction within experience, not its standalone existence. Furthermore, the perfection and historical prestige of certain art products establish conventions that inhibit novel insights; when an artwork achieves classic status, it becomes isolated from its human conditions of creation and its consequences in lived experience. Such separation constructs a barrier that obscures art's broader significance, relegating it to a detached realm. Thus, a fundamental obligation for those engaged in the philosophy of fine arts is to reestablish continuity between the intensified experiences of art and the mundane events that constitute ordinary life. For instance, mountains are not floating entities but are integral operations of the earth, much as art should be viewed in relation to daily existence. To grasp artistic meaning, one must occasionally disregard the artworks themselves and recourse to commonplace experiential forces, undertaking a theoretical detour. Many contemporary arts with vitality, like cinema or jazz, are not conventionally recognized as such, as art is often confined to institutional settings. True appreciation flourishes when distinguished objects are intimately linked with the products of everyday endeavors.","AESTHETICS

301,"Goat Racing

I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans, hordes of people, food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse, I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. An area had been cordoned off to make a course for competitors. Not quite on a par with established racecourses, but on the similar assumption that spectators were to line either side of a stretch of ground along which the participants would travel. An attempt was being made to keep a handful of select goats in order. No mean feat when dealing with an animal fabled to eat almost anything it can get hold of.

Canoe Trip

As the day drew to a close, I started to think about the night ahead, and I shuddered with fear. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, and with the aid of our torch we could just make out the line of the cliffs; the torch batteries were failing, so we put in new ones, but they didn't work. Obviously we weren't going to be able to spot a camping place. A couple of miles later, Lesley called out that she had seen a distant flickering light and our hopes soared: the light turned out to be moonlight glinting on waves, soon we could hear the roaring noise of fast-rushing water, though we couldn't see what was happening. Time stood still, and we moved on.

How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions

I am not a natural at making presentations, yet in my role as managing director I am increasingly required to present infernally to my colleagues, not to mention externally to the major shareholders. How can I improve my presentational techniques and my confidence?
You are not the only one. Making a presentation involves completely different skills from those you need to run a company, yet more and more senior executives are expected to be accomplished at it.
If you are trying to convince your audience of something, you have to be convinced yourself. Demonstrate your conviction in the passion and enthusiasm you bring to the presentation. That means you must do your homework. Test your proposition carefully in advance. Ask colleagues to identify the 'hard questions' your audience might put to you. You also need to build a positive climate from the outset.

302,"Every Picture Tells a Story

Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction, condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs. I do not mean 'redundancy' in the usual colloquial sense of material which is unnecessary, but in a technical sense.
In a novel, such redundancy would include the repeated allusion to certain traits by which characters are identified, as well as speech tags such as 'he said'. Strictly speaking a character trait needs to be described only once, but it assists comprehension if we are constantly reminded of it. And usually we can infer who is speaking in a scene of dialogue from the content and layout on the page, but speech tags make reading easier.
Stage drama, which consists mostly of speech, imitates and reproduces the redundancy of real speech with various degrees of stylisation. In some modern dramas, this is taken to an extreme, so that the dialogue seems to consist almost entirely of redundant language, whose function is purely phatic (merely establishing contact between the two speakers), leaving us in the dark as to what is being communicated.

Watching Movies

Watching movies, one can be carried away to the degree that one feels part of the world of the moving picture. It is an experience that lifts one out of oneself into a world where one is not beholden to ordinary reality, at least for the length of the film. So it seems that what one feels and does while at the movies does not really count.
But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is abruptly broken, one is again in the ordinary world. One does not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents one from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in my boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'. This was how some people of our parents' generation, and most of our teachers, disparaged the movies. Like most people, they liked to be entertained, but they did not consider the movies to be an art.

The film studios

The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a huddle of many disparate buildings. The topography of the place was irrational and obscure. It possessed, certainly, a few permanent landmarks such as the Script Department, out for the rest it appeared to be made up of numerous small rooms, identically furnished, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations and could be distinguished one from another only by a surrealist system of digits and letters of the alphabet, and to locate any particular one of these unaided was a considerable enterprise. More than anything else, perhaps, the studio lacked a focus. A decisive single main entrance might have provided this, but in fact there were three main entrances, severely egalitarian in their amenities and with nothing to choose between them except that one of them gave access to the place where you wanted to arrive and the other two did not; and in none of them was there anywhere where enquiries could be made and some species of orientation established. To the mere stranger it was all vastly confusing.
Mere strangers, however, were few and far between; for obvious reasons, the organisation did not encourage their presence. And it was to be presumed that people who worked there could find their way about all right. And by these employees' united labours, romance and adventure would travel the country. Hand in hand, head against shoulder, Jane and George, Sally and Dick would, for three hours at least, snatch immunity, by the studio's contriving, from domestic contention and public strife, from tedium and malice and routine, and the struggle to keep alive.

Film-makers

Almost everybody, it seems, wants to make a movie. Bookshops fill shelves with 'how-to' books about scriptwriting and film production. Fashionable universities offer courses. There are competitions offering the kind of hand-held camera that Robert Rodriguez used to make the film El Mariachi, which cost $7,000 to make and shot him from nowhere into the front line of American independent directors. If ever dreams came true, they did for Rodriguez - and ahead of schedule. Recalling his 23rd birthday in his book about his Mariachi adventures, he writes: ""Orson Welles made Citizen Kane when he was 25. Spielberg made Laws at 26. So I've only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film.'
This was not always so. When the studios ruled, film-makers were expected to take time to mature. They worked behind the scenes, as editors, writers or cinematographers. They learnt the job directing low-budget Westerns or supporting short films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, The Maltese Falcon. Fred Zinnemann, the director of High Noon, only got into his stride in his forties. But nowadays, without the support system of studios or television, aspiring film-makers are forced to be mavericks.",C2,"Every picture tells a story. When books become movies, people take out some parts. This can make writers sad, but it can also help them learn. In a book, writers use many words to describe things and people. In a movie, they use fewer words but say the same thing. This is because movies and books are different. In books, writers repeat things to help us remember. For example, they say 'he said' many times. In plays, people talk a lot with extra words that do not say much. Watching movies can make you feel like you are in another world. You forget your real life for a while. When the movie ends, you come back to reality. Some people think movies are just fun, not art. The Leiper Film Company has many buildings. It is hard to find your way there. There are three main doors, and no one to ask for help. But workers know where to go. They make movies that let people escape from their problems. Many people want to make movies. They read books and go to school to learn. Robert Rodriguez made a cheap movie and became famous. He wanted to be like other famous directors. In the past, movie makers learned slowly. Now, they have to do it alone.","Every picture tells a story. When novels are made into films, parts are often cut out or made shorter. This can upset writers, but it can also be educational. While writing a script, I noticed that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from the book and still convey the same meaning. This doesn't mean the original was unnecessary; it's about how books and films require different kinds of attention from the audience. In novels, redundancy helps understanding, like repeating character traits or using 'he said' to show who is speaking. In stage plays, dialogue often includes extra words that don't add meaning, just to keep conversation going. Watching movies can transport you to another world, making you feel part of the story and free from everyday life. When the film ends, the feeling stops, and you don't feel responsible for that time. Some people, like teachers in the past, thought movies were only entertainment, not art. The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings that were confusing to navigate. There were three main entrances, all similar, with no information desk. Strangers found it hard, but employees knew their way. Together, they created films that provided escape from daily troubles. Many people dream of making movies. They use guidebooks and take courses. Robert Rodriguez made a low-budget film called El Mariachi and became a famous director quickly. He aimed to succeed young, like Orson Welles. In the old days, filmmakers learned over time by working on smaller projects, but now they often have to be independent.","Every picture tells a story. Adapting novels for film typically involves reducing, condensing, or deleting content. This process can be frustrating for authors, yet it can also provide insights. When I worked on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and narrative from the novel could be omitted while still communicating the same ideas. This isn't because the original material was unnecessary; rather, it relates to the different ways novels and films engage their audiences and use redundancy. In this context, redundancy doesn't mean something useless but refers to technical elements that aid comprehension. For instance, in novels, redundancy includes repeated references to character traits or speech tags like 'he said', which make reading smoother. In stage drama, dialogue often mimics real speech with redundant, phatic language that serves to maintain contact between characters without conveying much meaning. Watching movies can be an immersive experience, making viewers feel detached from reality and absorbed in the film's world. After the movie ends, this spell breaks, and people may not take the experience seriously, reflecting past views that movies were mere entertainment rather than art. The Leiper Film Company studios consisted of many disparate buildings with an irrational layout. It had few permanent landmarks and numerous identical rooms, identified by a confusing system of codes. There were three main entrances, none with information points, making it difficult for strangers to navigate. However, employees could find their way, and through their work, they produced films that offered audiences a temporary escape from life's challenges. Nowadays, many aspire to make films, utilizing how-to books and university courses. Robert Rodriguez, for example, used a low-cost camera to make El Mariachi, which launched his career as an independent director. He felt pressure to achieve success early, unlike in the past when filmmakers matured slowly through roles like editing or cinematography.","Every picture tells a story. The adaptation of novels into films invariably entails a process of reduction, condensation, and deletion. This can prove frustrating for writers, yet it may also yield illuminating insights. While developing a script, I was struck by how much dialogue and narrative description from a novel could be discarded without compromising the essential message. This does not imply that the original elements were superfluous; instead, it highlights the distinct types of attention demanded by each narrative medium and the specific redundancies they employ. Here, redundancy is not used in its common sense of being unnecessary but in a technical sense. In novels, such redundancy encompasses repeated allusions to character traits and speech tags like 'he said', which facilitate reader comprehension even if strictly redundant. Stage drama, predominantly composed of speech, replicates the redundancy of actual conversation with varying stylization, sometimes to an extreme where dialogue appears largely phatic, serving merely to establish contact without substantive communication. Viewing films can transport individuals to such an extent that they feel integrated into the cinematic world, offering an escape from ordinary reality. Once the film concludes, this illusion dissipates, and viewers often disregard the experience as insignificant, echoing historical perceptions that movies were mere entertainment rather than a legitimate art form. The studios of the Leiper Film Company were a conglomerate of disparate structures with an obscure and irrational topography. While it featured a few permanent landmarks such as the Script Department, the remainder comprised numerous identically furnished rooms used for various discussions, distinguishable only by a surreal alphanumeric system. Locating a specific room unaided was a considerable challenge. The site lacked a focal point, exacerbated by three egalitarian main entrances, none equipped for inquiries, rendering it highly confusing to outsiders. However, employees navigated it effectively, and through their collaborative efforts, they produced films that provided audiences with respite from domestic and public strife. Presently, there is a widespread desire to make movies, evidenced by proliferating instructional books and academic courses. Competitions offer equipment like the hand-held cameras used by Robert Rodriguez for El Mariachi, a film made on a $7,000 budget that propelled him to prominence among independent American directors. Rodriguez aspired to early success, contrasting with earlier eras when filmmakers like John Huston and Fred Zinnemann matured gradually through apprenticeships in editing or low-budget productions, whereas contemporary aspirants often must operate as mavericks without studio support.","Every picture tells a story. The cinematic adaptation of novels almost invariably involves a process of reduction, condensation, and deletion, which can be profoundly frustrating for the author yet simultaneously illuminating. In crafting a screenplay, I discerned that substantial portions of dialogue and narrative description from the original text could be omitted while still effectively conveying the intended meaning. This is not to suggest that the original elements were superfluous; rather, it pertains to the divergent types of attention requisite from audiences in each narrative medium and the distinct forms of redundancy they utilize. In this context, redundancy is not employed in its colloquial sense of being unnecessary but in a technical capacity. Within novels, such redundancy includes recurrent allusions to character-defining traits and speech tags such as 'he said', which, while technically redundant after initial introduction, enhance reader comprehension and fluency. Stage drama, constituted largely of dialogue, emulates and reproduces the redundancy inherent in actual speech, often with considerable stylization; in certain modern plays, this is exaggerated to the point where dialogue seems predominantly phatic, functioning merely to sustain interpersonal contact without conveying substantive information. The experience of watching films can be so immersive that viewers feel transported into the cinematic realm, liberated from the constraints of ordinary reality for the duration of the feature. Upon the conclusion of the film, this enchantment is abruptly terminated, and individuals frequently regard the time spent under its influence as inconsequential, reflecting antiquated attitudes that dismissed cinema as mere entertainment rather than a legitimate art form. The Leiper Film Company studios comprised an assemblage of disparate edifices with an irrational and obscure topography. While it possessed certain permanent landmarks like the Script Department, the remainder consisted of myriad small, identically appointed chambers utilized for both formal and informal confabulations, distinguishable only through a surrealist system of alphanumeric codes, and unaided navigation to any specific locale constituted a considerable endeavor. The complex notably lacked a central focus, a deficiency that might have been mitigated by a singular main entrance; however, there were three principal entrances, all equitably equipped, with no means to ascertain orientation, rendering the site vastly perplexing to unacquainted visitors. Nevertheless, employees could adeptly navigate the premises, and through their concerted labors, they generated cinematic narratives that afforded audiences, such as fictional couples Jane and George or Sally and Dick, a temporary reprieve from domestic discord, public adversity, tedium, malice, and the exigencies of daily existence. In contemporary times, there is a pervasive aspiration to engage in filmmaking, as evidenced by the proliferation of instructional literature on scriptwriting and production, as well as courses offered by prestigious academic institutions. Competitions provide resources like the hand-held cameras utilized by Robert Rodriguez for El Mariachi, a film produced on a modest budget of $7,000 that catapulted him from obscurity to the vanguard of American independent directors. Rodriguez, reflecting on his ambitions in his literary account, noted the precedents set by luminaries such as Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg, feeling compelled to achieve comparable success at a youthful age. This contrasts sharply with historical norms under studio hegemony, where filmmakers were anticipated to mature gradually through apprenticeships in roles such as editing, writing, or cinematography, often directing low-budget Westerns or short films before attaining prominence—exemplified by John Huston's debut at age 35 or Fred Zinnemann's ascendance in his forties. In the current landscape, devoid of the supportive infrastructure once provided by studios or television, aspiring filmmakers are often compelled to adopt a maverick approach.","Every Picture Tells a Story

Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction, condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs. I do not mean 'redundancy' in the usual colloquial sense of material which is unnecessary, but in a technical sense.
In a novel, such redundancy would include the repeated allusion to certain traits by which characters are identified, as well as speech tags such as 'he said'. Strictly speaking a character trait needs to be described only once, but it assists comprehension if we are constantly reminded of it. And usually we can infer who is speaking in a scene of dialogue from the content and layout on the page, but speech tags make reading easier.
Stage drama, which consists mostly of speech, imitates and reproduces the redundancy of real speech with various degrees of stylisation. In some modern dramas, this is taken to an extreme, so that the dialogue seems to consist almost entirely of redundant language, whose function is purely phatic (merely establishing contact between the two speakers), leaving us in the dark as to what is being communicated.

Watching Movies

Watching movies, one can be carried away to the degree that one feels part of the world of the moving picture. It is an experience that lifts one out of oneself into a world where one is not beholden to ordinary reality, at least for the length of the film. So it seems that what one feels and does while at the movies does not really count.
But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is abruptly broken, one is again in the ordinary world. One does not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents one from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in my boyhood not an art, but 'mere entertainment'. This was how some people of our parents' generation, and most of our teachers, disparaged the movies. Like most people, they liked to be entertained, but they did not consider the movies to be an art.

The film studios

The site of the Leiper Film Company studios was a huddle of many disparate buildings. The topography of the place was irrational and obscure. It possessed, certainly, a few permanent landmarks such as the Script Department, out for the rest it appeared to be made up of numerous small rooms, identically furnished, which were employed for official and unofficial confabulations and could be distinguished one from another only by a surrealist system of digits and letters of the alphabet, and to locate any particular one of these unaided was a considerable enterprise. More than anything else, perhaps, the studio lacked a focus. A decisive single main entrance might have provided this, but in fact there were three main entrances, severely egalitarian in their amenities and with nothing to choose between them except that one of them gave access to the place where you wanted to arrive and the other two did not; and in none of them was there anywhere where enquiries could be made and some species of orientation established. To the mere stranger it was all vastly confusing.
Mere strangers, however, were few and far between; for obvious reasons, the organisation did not encourage their presence. And it was to be presumed that people who worked there could find their way about all right. And by these employees' united labours, romance and adventure would travel the country. Hand in hand, head against shoulder, Jane and George, Sally and Dick would, for three hours at least, snatch immunity, by the studio's contriving, from domestic contention and public strife, from tedium and malice and routine, and the struggle to keep alive.

304,"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON

American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America, however, has only just discovered him - although the Wall Street Journal's description of Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose beats went all but unnoticed for most of the 20th century' is taking things too far. But now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are in production and are expected to spring off the shells as fast as they are stacked; the American Museum of Natural History is mounting a grand exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is preparing a film based on Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as icon and exemplar. His sell-appointed apostles recount the details of his deeds with awe; they extract lessons in leadership and communications as parables for spin doctors, and insiders refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined, resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, took Shackleton for a role model years ago. His firm specialises in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises'. Such as? Such as 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go'. While not forgetting that Shackleton served time in public relations for a Glasgow steel works, it may be a trifle difficult to spot instantly the relevance of eking out the last bit of albatross in sub-zero temperatures to putting a spin on a derivatives trading disaster for the Internet.
'Even if a company manages its crises beautifully, it can still do a lot of harm by communicating sadly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. he was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose -- such as their lives. In some ways the most fascinating decision Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That trip explained his credibility for the next one: the lives of his men were paramount.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their objective, with unforeseen delays draining their supplies and limited time to get back to their ship, Shackleton made the courageous and difficult decision to turn hack.
In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Whereas now the tendency is for managers to duck and squirm, Shackleton was prepared to stand up and accept responsibility. His 1914 expedition was the one that became the stuff of legend. His ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in the pack ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it finally went down, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries the then kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men continually informed and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling thry're being criticised.'
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating, especially in America, a culture that is fanatically opposed to letting time sort things out,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell up would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product's a stinker, don't keep selling it.'
Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expeditions: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavour is increasing. Shackleton exposes the fact that there is nothing heroic going on now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the genuine embodiment of the ideals that we are so wistful for nowadays.'
",C2,"Ernest Shackleton was an explorer. He went to Antarctica. Now, American business leaders like him. They think he was a good boss. They read books about him. They make films about him.

People admire him for his bravery and care.","Ernest Shackleton was a famous Antarctic explorer. Recently, American executives have started to admire him as an example of effective management. There is growing interest in America, with biographies, exhibitions, and a film being produced about his expeditions. Managers study his actions, such as his decision to turn back when close to the South Pole to protect his men's lives. He demonstrated strong leadership by planning carefully, communicating well, and accepting responsibility during crises. For instance, when his ship Endurance was destroyed, he ensured his team's survival. His qualities, like optimism and adaptability, are seen as valuable lessons for modern business.","Ernest Shackleton, the renowned Antarctic explorer, has been adopted by American executives as a paradigm of superior management. In the United States, there is a surge of enthusiasm for his legacy, marked by the production of biographies, a major museum exhibition, and a forthcoming film. Management consultants extol his leadership, citing examples like his prudent decision to abort the South Pole attempt to safeguard his crew. Shackleton excelled in crises, maintaining control, informing his team, and adapting plans as needed. His actions, such as sacrificing his own gloves for a photographer, illustrate his commitment to his men. This admiration reflects a broader yearning for heroic leadership in contemporary culture.","American corporate leaders are increasingly venerating the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as an archetype of exemplary management. This burgeoning fascination in the United States is evidenced by a flurry of biographies, a grand exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History, and an impending film by Columbia Tristar. Executives and consultants analyze Shackleton's expeditions for insights into leadership and crisis communication, drawing parallels to modern corporate challenges. His pivotal decision to retreat from the South Pole, prioritizing his men's survival, underscores his credibility and strategic acumen. Shackleton's adeptness in maintaining morale, planning for contingencies, and embodying responsibility during adversities, such as the Endurance's destruction, renders him a pertinent model for contemporary management principles, resonating with a cultural appetite for authentic heroism.","HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON

305,"Fashion

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out, though, that fashion, at least in the sense of style and design, has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point.
As societies have developed in complexity, populations have expanded, and multiple technologies for producing an increasing variety of clothing and physical adornment have been discovered, so the meanings attached to dress have also increased in their complexity and significance. Consequently, it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty today what any item of clothing or adornment actually means. For example, a man's suit, supposedly an indicator of the most extreme uniformity, actually conveys very differing meanings in different contexts and to different people.

Writer

Newspaper reports of publishers in bidding wars over whizz-kid manuscripts have resulted in a skewed idea of what life is like for your average novelist. Down at my end of the business - i.e. not exactly topping the best-seller lists - there are two ways of making ends meet. The wisest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if the book doesn't immediately get snapped up and turned into a film. Those such as myself, however, are literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a bit of teaching, the occasional workshop and articles like this. I have heard tell of an in-house writing opportunity offered by a chocolate factory, but I've never managed to get anything like that. Somehow, though, by dint of juggling part-time jobs and credit cards and also, more often than not, thanks to the generosity of those names you find in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

Sudden Fame

The small venues we were performing at around the country were all beginning to sell out and extra bouncers were having to be called in to hold back the growing legion of screaming girls. We found ourselves having to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms we were playing to prevent ourselves being mobbed by fans. On the few nights a week when we were not working, we found it difficult to leave the house without being pursued through the streets by adoring followers. In a matter of days, we had been transformed into celebrities. Our moves were monitored by our admirers and all of our needs catered for by our management and other interested parties. Even though the shyness that had always accompanied me never quite went away, it was replaced by a strange naive over-confidence that only naturally shy people who have been thrust into similar situations can relate to. In short, I was emotionally totally out of my depth.",C2,"Fashion is about clothes. People think fashion is new. But fashion is very old. Clothes can mean different things. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people. Writer: Many writers have other jobs. Some write at night and work in the day. Others do small jobs like teaching. They use money from jobs and help from friends to write books. Sudden Fame: We became famous quickly. Many girls came to our shows. We had to use secret doors to avoid fans. We could not go out without people following us. We had everything we needed. I was shy, but I felt too confident.","Fashion is often seen as a modern thing, but it has a long history. Historians say fashion started long ago with trade. As societies grew, clothes became more complex and had more meanings. It is hard to know what clothes mean today. For example, a man's suit can mean different things in different places. Writer: People think writers become rich, but most do not. Some writers have full-time jobs and write in their free time. Others, like me, do small jobs such as teaching or writing articles to earn money. With help from friends and part-time work, I can write novels. Sudden Fame: We became famous suddenly. Our shows sold out, and we needed more security. We used secret entrances to avoid fans. When not working, we could not go out without being followed. We were celebrities with people watching our every move. I was shy, but I felt overly confident in this new situation.","Fashion is commonly viewed as a modern phenomenon linked to capitalism, yet historians emphasize that fashion has a very long history, often tracing it back to the rise of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex and technologies for producing clothing have advanced, the meanings associated with dress have grown more intricate and significant. Consequently, it is challenging to determine the exact meaning of any clothing item today; for instance, a man's suit may convey vastly different meanings depending on the context and observer. Writer: The perception that novelists easily achieve success is misleading. In reality, many writers maintain full-time jobs and write during evenings to support themselves. Others, including myself, rely on various part-time work such as teaching, workshops, and articles to make a living. Despite financial struggles, with the support of friends and juggling multiple jobs, we manage to complete our novels. Sudden Fame: Our rapid rise to fame meant that our performances sold out, requiring additional security. We had to use hidden entrances to evade enthusiastic fans. On nights off, leaving home often resulted in being pursued by admirers. We were treated as celebrities, with our every move monitored and all needs provided for. Although I remained inherently shy, I developed an uncharacteristic overconfidence that is common among shy individuals in such circumstances, leaving me emotionally overwhelmed.","Fashion is frequently perceived as a contemporary development heavily reliant on capitalism from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; however, most fashion historians stress that fashion, in terms of style and design, possesses a lengthy historical lineage, often commencing with the expansion of market trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have evolved in complexity, populations have increased, and diverse technologies for creating clothing and adornments have emerged, the significances attached to attire have likewise become more multifaceted and consequential. Thus, it is presently difficult to ascertain with certainty the precise meaning of any garment or accessory; for example, a man's suit, while ostensibly symbolizing uniformity, actually communicates highly variable meanings across different contexts and to different individuals. Writer: Media depictions of publishers engaging in bidding wars over promising manuscripts have fostered a distorted impression of the typical novelist's life. At the less lucrative end of the spectrum, authors sustain themselves through two primary means: the more prudent write during evenings while holding stable full-time employment, whereas others, like myself, function as literary freelancers, surviving on intermittent teaching, workshops, and articles. Although I have encountered opportunities such as in-house writing roles, I have not secured them; nonetheless, by balancing part-time work, credit, and often the generosity acknowledged in book dedications, I succeed in completing novels. Sudden Fame: Our ascent to stardom was abrupt, with small venues selling out and additional bouncers required to manage throngs of screaming fans. We resorted to covert entrances to avoid being mobbed, and on off-nights, venturing outdoors invariably led to being chased by devoted followers. We were catapulted into celebrity status, with our actions scrutinized and all necessities attended to by management and associates. Despite my persistent shyness, it was supplanted by a peculiar, naive overconfidence typical of introverts thrust into such scenarios, leaving me emotionally out of my depth.","Fashion is often regarded as a modern phenomenon, ostensibly contingent upon the capitalist frameworks of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for its evolution. Nonetheless, the majority of fashion historians are meticulous in highlighting that fashion, at least in the context of style and design, boasts a considerable historical trajectory, frequently initiating with the proliferation of market economies and mercantile trade during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have advanced in intricacy, populations have burgeoned, and multifarious technologies for fabricating an expanding array of clothing and personal adornments have been devised, the connotations associated with attire have concomitantly escalated in complexity and import. Consequently, it is presently arduous to assert with any certitude the definitive meaning of any sartorial item or embellishment; for instance, a man's suit, purportedly emblematic of utmost uniformity, in fact conveys profoundly disparate significances across varied contexts and to distinct observers. Writer: Newspaper accounts of publishers embroiled in competitive bidding for prodigious manuscripts have engendered a skewed conception of the average novelist's existence. In the less illustrious echelons of the profession—where best-seller status is elusive—there exist two predominant methods of financial sustenance: the more sagacious authors compose during nocturnal hours whilst maintaining other full-time occupations that provide stability irrespective of the book's immediate commercial success, whereas individuals such as myself operate as literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a mélange of teaching engagements, sporadic workshops, and journalistic contributions. I have been apprised of in-house writing opportunities, such as those proffered by a chocolate manufacturer, yet I have never succeeded in securing analogous positions. Nevertheless, through the diligent juggling of part-time employments and credit facilities, and frequently owing to the benevolence of those acknowledged in dedications, the novel is ultimately brought to fruition. Sudden Fame: Our precipitous rise to renown was characterized by small venues across the nation selling out, necessitating the deployment of additional security personnel to restrain the burgeoning legions of fervent, screaming admirers. We found ourselves compelled to utilize clandestine entrances to the village halls and ballrooms where we performed to circumvent being mobbed by fans. On the infrequent evenings when we were not engaged in performances, egress from our residences proved challenging without incurring pursuit through the streets by adulatory devotees. Within a remarkably brief span, we were transmuted into celebrities, with our every maneuver scrutinized by admirers and all exigencies catered to by our management and other invested parties. Although the diffidence that had perpetually accompanied me never entirely dissipated, it was superseded by a peculiar, naive overconfidence that only inherently timid individuals subjected to analogous circumstances can comprehend, rendering me emotionally entirely out of my depth.","Fashion

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out, though, that fashion, at least in the sense of style and design, has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point.
As societies have developed in complexity, populations have expanded, and multiple technologies for producing an increasing variety of clothing and physical adornment have been discovered, so the meanings attached to dress have also increased in their complexity and significance. Consequently, it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty today what any item of clothing or adornment actually means. For example, a man's suit, supposedly an indicator of the most extreme uniformity, actually conveys very differing meanings in different contexts and to different people.

Writer

Newspaper reports of publishers in bidding wars over whizz-kid manuscripts have resulted in a skewed idea of what life is like for your average novelist. Down at my end of the business - i.e. not exactly topping the best-seller lists - there are two ways of making ends meet. The wisest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if the book doesn't immediately get snapped up and turned into a film. Those such as myself, however, are literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a bit of teaching, the occasional workshop and articles like this. I have heard tell of an in-house writing opportunity offered by a chocolate factory, but I've never managed to get anything like that. Somehow, though, by dint of juggling part-time jobs and credit cards and also, more often than not, thanks to the generosity of those names you find in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

Sudden Fame

The small venues we were performing at around the country were all beginning to sell out and extra bouncers were having to be called in to hold back the growing legion of screaming girls. We found ourselves having to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms we were playing to prevent ourselves being mobbed by fans. On the few nights a week when we were not working, we found it difficult to leave the house without being pursued through the streets by adoring followers. In a matter of days, we had been transformed into celebrities. Our moves were monitored by our admirers and all of our needs catered for by our management and other interested parties. Even though the shyness that had always accompanied me never quite went away, it was replaced by a strange naive over-confidence that only naturally shy people who have been thrust into similar situations can relate to. In short, I was emotionally totally out of my depth."
306,"Language

You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability, we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth, they will soon be exchanging words. When there is no one to talk with, people talk to themselves, to their dogs, even to their plants. I like to describe the skill of language as an 'instinct'. This conveys the idea that people know how to talk in more or less the sense that spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not invented by some unsung spider genius, and does not depend on having had the right education or on having an aptitude for architecture or the construction trades.

Climate and Weather

Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, profoundly affect the lives and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can be a dominating force on the character of landscapes. For example, warmth and wetness all the year round allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are natural treasure troves, with an incredible diversity of species. Conversely cold, windswept areas can muster only a scattered selection of living things. The daily weather patterns that add up in the long term to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing, for the atmosphere is never still. Some of the motion is due to the fact that the envelope of gases rests on a spinning globe, because air is thin it is not dragged along at the same speed as the earth, but tends to lag behind. A more important source of turbulence, or air movement, however, is the sun.

Coffee

My duties as bar-person included serving drinks but, more worryingly, I was to be responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant can stand or fall on its coffee reputation. There followed several days of intensive coffee-making training, in which I took in more than I could ever wish to know about the cleaning and maintenance of the restaurants gleaming espresso machine. I learnt, too, about the essential principles involved in making the perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week I had to admit that making a decent cup of coffee was not as easy as it looked and I fully expected to be banished to lowly ash-tray wiping duties again. Luckily, my boss was a patient man. 'Making coffee is both an art and a science,' he said, 'and you need time to acquire the knack.'",C2,"Language: People can talk to each other. It is a big part of life. People talk to others, to themselves, or to pets. Language is like a natural skill, such as spiders making webs. Climate and Weather: The air makes weather and climate. This affects animals and plants. Warm, wet places have many plants and animals. Cold, windy places have few. The sun and earth's spin move the air. Coffee: I worked in a cafe. I had to make coffee. In Melbourne, good coffee is important. I learned to use the coffee machine and make cappuccino. It was hard, but my boss was patient. He said making coffee is an art and a science.","Language: Humans have a special ability to communicate using language. It is very common in daily life; people talk to each other, themselves, or even animals. Language is an instinct, similar to how spiders naturally spin webs without learning. Climate and Weather: Climate and weather come from the air and influence where animals and plants live. For instance, tropical jungles with warmth and rain have many species, while cold, windy areas have fewer. Weather patterns form from air moving because the earth spins and the sun heats it. Coffee: I had a job as a barista where I served drinks and made coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant's success depends on its coffee. I trained for days on using the espresso machine and making frothy cappuccino. It was difficult, but my patient boss explained that coffee-making is both an art and a science.","Language: Humans possess a remarkable ability to communicate precisely through language, which is essential to human experience. People often talk to others, themselves, or pets, showing that language is an innate instinct, much like spiders spinning webs naturally. Climate and Weather: Climate and weather, created by the atmosphere, deeply affect the distribution of animals and plants. Climate shapes landscapes; for example, constant warmth and moisture support diverse tropical jungles, whereas cold, windy regions have sparse life. Daily weather results from air masses moving due to the earth's rotation and solar heating, with the sun being a key cause of turbulence. Coffee: As a barista, my duties included serving drinks and making coffee, which was crucial for the restaurant's reputation in Melbourne. I underwent intensive training on maintaining the espresso machine and preparing perfect cappuccino. Initially challenging, I feared demotion, but my patient boss emphasized that coffee-making is an art and a science requiring practice.","Language: Humans have a unique capacity to influence each other's minds with precision through language, an integral part of existence that makes it hard to envision life without it. Wherever people gather, they communicate, often talking to themselves or their pets. I characterize language as an instinct, analogous to spiders spinning webs—a natural ability not invented or learned through education. Climate and Weather: Climate and weather, predominantly shaped by the atmosphere, exert a profound impact on the lives and distribution of flora and fauna. Climate can dominate landscape characteristics; tropical jungles thrive under perpetual warmth and humidity, harboring immense biodiversity, in contrast to windswept, cold areas with limited species. Weather patterns accumulate into climate through atmospheric movements, partly due to the earth's rotation causing air to lag, but more significantly from solar-induced turbulence. Coffee: In my role as a barista, I was tasked with serving beverages and, more dauntingly, preparing coffee, as a restaurant's standing in Melbourne hinges on its coffee quality. I received days of rigorous training on espresso machine upkeep and the principles of crafting rich, frothy cappuccino. Admitting the difficulty, I anticipated reassignment, but my boss, demonstrating patience, described coffee-making as both an artistic and scientific skill that demands time to master.","Language: You and I are part of a species endowed with a remarkable ability to shape events in one another's brains with exquisite precision through language, which is so deeply embedded in human experience that imagining life without it is scarcely feasible. Invariably, when individuals congregate, they engage in verbal exchange; in solitude, people may converse with themselves, their dogs, or even plants. I prefer to depict linguistic proficiency as an 'instinct,' conveying that humans know how to communicate in much the same way that spiders know how to spin webs—an innate capability not devised by any progenitor nor dependent on education or aptitude. Climate and Weather: Climate and weather, principally generated by the atmospheric envelope, profoundly influence the existence and dispersion of animals and plants, with climate often acting as a dominating force on landscape character. For instance, year-round warmth and precipitation facilitate the proliferation of tropical jungles, veritable treasure troves boasting incredible species diversity, whereas frigid, windswept regions sustain only a sparse assemblage of organisms. The diurnal weather phenomena that aggregate into climate are precipitated by vast air masses ascending and intermingling, for the atmosphere is perpetually in motion; some of this dynamism stems from the gaseous sheath resting on a rotating globe, wherein the tenuous air tends to lag behind rather than match the terrestrial velocity, yet a more consequential source of turbulence is solar radiation. Coffee: My responsibilities as a bar-person encompassed serving libations but, more disconcertingly, entailed accountability for coffee preparation, given that in Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's viability can be contingent upon its repute for coffee. This was followed by several days of intensive barista training, during which I assimilated an excess of knowledge regarding the cleansing and maintenance of the establishment's gleaming espresso apparatus. I also apprehended the fundamental tenets involved in concocting the ideal cup of opulent, frothy cappuccino. By the conclusion of the inaugural week, I conceded that producing a satisfactory coffee was not as facile as it appeared and fully anticipated relegation to menial ash-tray cleansing duties anew; fortuitously, my supervisor proved patient, asserting that coffee fabrication constitutes both an art and a science necessitating temporal investment to acquire the knack.","Language

307,"Kinetic Art

Rejoice -- the well-nigh impossible has happened: London's austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not, thankfully, by some huge-budget, mega-hyped, multi-media extravaganza, but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art -- that is art which is concerned with movement -- in the twentieth century. In the process, it reveals that making artworks which either move by themselves or investigate the idea of movement in some way has been a consistent if largely unrecognised theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. And not only that -- the marvellous range of paintings and drawings, documents and films on kinetic art assembled by curator Guy Brett, who has made a life-long study of the subject, are presented largely unmediated by text. Visitors, unharried by explanations, are left to have the pleasure of making connections and discoveries for themselves.

David Hockney

Hockney's work appeals to a great many people who might otherwise display little interest in art. It may be that they are attracted to it because it is figurative and, therefore, easily accessible on one level, or because the subject matter of leisure and exorcism provides an escape from the mundanities of everyday life. Perhaps it is not even the art that interests some people, but Hockney's engaging personality and the verbal wit that makes him such good copy for the newspapers. He may, in other words, be popular for the wrong reasons. But does this negate the possibility that his art has a serious sense of purpose?
In the view of some respected critics, Hockney is nothing more than an overrated minor artist. To this one can counter that Hockney might seem minor because it is unacceptable today to be so popular, rather than because his work is lacking in substance. Hockney himself is not self-deluding; he is aware of his limitations and thinks that it is beside the point to dismiss his work because it does not measure up to an abstract concept of greatness. Hockney does not claim to be a great artist and is aware that only posterity can form a final judgement on his stature.

Window-shopping - an art exhibition

In the last few years I have seen loads of exhibitions of contemporary art, and amongst them brilliance and mediocrity. What always bugs me, though, are shows that seem to push an underlying agenda, suggesting there is a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes it works, we really are made aware of new trends mining though apparently unrelated work. More often, though, we are alerted to a dubious angle or a forced concept. This led me, as a curator, to attempt a show which stands as an antithesis to this.
Together with seven artists I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was intended as a collection of individual artworks that related to each other purely through the fact that they proclaimed to be art. Sam Cole's knitted cats went barmy chasing each other round on a toy train track. In contrast Matthew Crawley's turning on a video camera, opening it up and poking around in there until it breaks flickered, flashed and disappeared on the monitor in the corner. These works certainly didn't fit into the 'an exhibition exploring the theme of ...' category, and wouldn't usually be seen together in the same show, but why not? They did not impede each other and actually, I hope, through their contrast, gave something to each other. OK, so I haven't made any grandiose statements about the nature of contemporary art practice, but there probably aren't any to be made about what is basically an individual activity in which artists set their own parameters.

Art History

People who enjoy paintings are sometimes reluctant to analyse them for fear of spoiling the richness and spontaneity of their experience. It has been suggested that some of the work done by art historians, whose concern is with theory rather than practice, ignores and indeed denies the aesthetic experience, the fundamental pleasure of looking, as well as the very special act of artistic creativity. This view is a bit like the notion that knowing the ingredients of the recipe, recognising the method of cooking and seeing the utensils employed detracts from the taste of the dish.
Acknowledging the importance of enjoying something does not, of course, preclude a thorough knowledge of the object that is arousing pleasure. It might in fact be more pleasurable if we know more about the object we are viewing. Moreover, pleasure is not a simple matter. The arousal of our senses - and how we recognise and register it - is itself open to interrogation. It is also historically located. Why we like particular characteristics of certain sorts of objects at any one time is not simply the result of our genes or our own particular personalities but is determined by values promoted within the society of which we are a part. So, while no one seeks to underestimate the importance of sensuous and instinctive responses to art objects, the notion that the sensuous is undermined by the intellectual is a legacy from a period in the past which promoted art as an alternative to thought.",C2,"{'Kinetic Art': 'The Hayward Gallery in London has a new show.

It was a lovely house that she was leaving, an elegant four-storeyed building overlooking a tiny harbour. The years she had spent there, the years of the children growing up and leaving, hung around in the air, faintly present like agitated dust. 
When told that they had bought this house, Robert, then five, had asked thoughtfully, 'Mum, when you buy a house, how d'you get it home?' You could miss a little boy in the physical presence of the adult he had become; Robert was here, helping, and in particular making sure she didn't let on about the piano. Francesca was here too, also helping, in her bossy way, stubbornly certain that nobody but she, the family daughter, would be careful enough over a fine instrument like a Steinway piano.
'She doesn't look like she's going to cry on us,' observed Fred. 'That's something.' 'Do people cry?' Susan asked, intrigued. 'You'd be surprised,' said Fred. 'They go around merry as magpies helping out till its all in the van, then you look round and there they are, crying in the middle of an empty room. They're fine when we get to the new place, mind. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.'
She could easily imagine.
Left to herself, Susan would have warned the removers about the piano before accepting the estimate. Robert had said sternly that it was their business to see the problem, and their bad luck if they didn't. The piano now stood in solitary glory in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would leave it till last, naturally. Sitting on the bottom stair, for all the chairs were gone now, she remembered the time they had arrived.
The day she was living through now was like that day filmed and run backwards - the piano had been carried in first. And it had got stuck on the stairs. For nearly two hours the team of removal men struggled manfully with it, until it seemed they would simply have to give up.
They brought it up to the turn of the stairs, and down again, and cut out banister rails, and got it jammed anyway, while little Robert looked on enthralled, and young Francesca wailed, 'We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't! I'd rather die!' And of course they couldn't, not with a musical daughter destined to be a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it in, and a way had been found.
Peter, her late husband, had come home to the crisis and had resolved it. The piano had been left in the garden while the other furniture was brought in - there was much less of it then, they had been relatively young and hard up. And next day, to everyone's surprise, a builder had been engaged to take out the first floor window.
Then, from the quay below the house, where fish were unloaded from the inshore boats, a little crane was borrowed, and dragged up the hill by means of the local farmer's tractor. Finally, the piano was wrapped in blankets, hooked to the crane and gently swung safely through the gaping window, while the entranced children danced with joy at the sight of it.
However, the whole process had cost so much it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned. 'That's that,' Peter had said. 'That's there for ever.' But for ever is a long time.
The children were increasingly too busy to come home at weekends, and Susan was no longer so mobile in the house, and puffing as she climbed the stairs. The thought of the stairs interrupted her daydream. The banister rails were still not quite parallel, they had not been put back perfectly all that time ago. She ought to have warned the removers, surely she ought. But now it was too late. Any moment now they would find it. She looked around, dazed and panic-stricken.
'Are you all right, love?' Fred was saying. 'Mind yourself, it's just the piano to come now, and then we'll be on our way.' She moved from the bottom stair, heart beating. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing in the back of the hallway to watch. 'No tears then?' Fred said, conversationally.
Truth to tell she was just on the edge of them. How odd that simply moving things made them matter. Chairs and cups and things, hundreds of things, that one never noticed or gave a moment's thought to while they stayed put, now they were displaced, were full of pathos, crying out to be cared about - and she would have cried, in a moment, surely she would.
Only just then the piano appeared, lurching at the top of the stairs, with Fred backing down in front of it and one of the others behind. It tipped slightly. 'Easy does it!' cried Fred, and they carried smoothly down the stairs and out of the front door, and put it down behind the removal van on the road.
It was Robert who laughed first, but then they couldn't stop laughing, relieved that it was all over. All three of them, helplessly, leaning against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. 'What's the joke, then?' asked Fred, but he merely started them off again. So that, as they went, the three of them, arm in arm down the path for the last time, the only tears she shed were tears of laughter.",C2,"Susan is a widow. Her children are grown up. She is leaving her house. Men are taking all her things away. They put things in boxes. Susan has a son, Robert, and a daughter, Francesca. They are helping. There is a big piano. When they moved in, the piano was hard to bring inside. They used a crane to lift it through a window. Now, the men are taking the piano out. It is easy. Susan and her children laugh. They are happy.","Susan is a widow with grown-up children. She is moving from her family home. Removal men are packing everything into boxes. Her son Robert and daughter Francesca are helping. Robert does not want Susan to tell the men about the piano. When they first moved in, the piano was difficult to get into the house. They had to remove a window and use a crane. Now, the removal men are taking the piano out easily. Susan and her children laugh with relief. They do not cry; they are happy.","Susan, a widow, is moving from her family home now that her children are adults. Removal men are carefully packing all the belongings. Her son Robert and daughter Francesca are assisting, with Robert insisting that Susan not mention the piano's past difficulties. When they first moved in, the piano got stuck on the stairs, and they had to use a crane to lift it through a window after removing it. Susan remembers this as she watches the removal process. Surprisingly, the piano is removed without any problems. Susan and her children end up laughing together in relief, instead of crying.","Widowed Susan is departing from her family home, with her adult children, Robert and Francesca, present to help. The removal team is efficiently packing items, while Susan reflects on past memories, particularly the challenging initial move-in of the piano, which required a crane and window removal due to it being stuck on the stairs. Robert had advised against warning the removers about this issue. As the piano is finally being taken out, it descends the stairs smoothly, leading to shared laughter and relief among Susan and her children, overshadowing any sadness.","As a widow with her children now grown, Susan is vacating the family residence, assisted by her son Robert and daughter Francesca during the removal process. The team meticulously packs possessions, evoking Susan's recollections of when they first moved in, and the piano's arduous installation that necessitated employing a crane after it became lodged on the staircase. Adhering to Robert's counsel, Susan refrains from alerting the removers to this prior complication. Ultimately, the piano is extracted without incident, prompting Susan and her offspring to erupt in relieved laughter, transforming potential melancholy into a moment of joyous camaraderie.","REMOVAL DAY

309,"Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds.
But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports

There's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird, a bird of portent, augury and divination. Is it spelling out some sort of message from a world at the very edges of my imagination? Or is it just a poor bird stuck in a greenhouse?
Depending on your point of view, both could be true. Wrens have been flitting through the undergrowth of British culture ever since it began. In medieval times, a complicated system of observing the directions in which wrens flew determined the sort of luck the observer would experience. In modern times, the image of the wren remains in pictures and ceramics in many British households. Even though the early beliefs may have been watered down or even forgotten, the wren still has a perch in our consciousness and a nest in our affections. A wood without wrens is a sad, impoverished place.
This is almost certainly because there is a rich vein of folklore running through our relationships with many birds which reaches back to a time when people read the world around them differently. Where people are, necessarily, hitched more directly to natural processes for their very survival, they develop an ecological and cultural language through which the significance of other creatures is communicated. This significance is, of course, prone to cultural shifts that cause major image changes for the creatures involved. A good example of this is the red kite. During the early sixteenth century, foreign visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take bread from the hands of children. These birds were protected and valued urban scavengers. But it was not long before they began to be seen as vermin, and as a result were soon wiped out in most areas apart from Wales. Gradually red kites began to assume a romantic personality linked to this Celtic stronghold and they have now become totemic birds of British conservation, protected again and reintroduced with a view to helping them regain their original distribution.
Our relationship with other creatures is more than cultural and goes way back to the evolution of human nature. Though the first human birdwatchers may have been acutely observant of bird behaviour because it announced approaching predators, bad weather and the availability of food, and also offered a supernatural link to the world of their dreams, there is more to it. When we ask why birds are so important to us, we are also asking what it is to be us. Flight, song, freedom - our fascination, envy and emulation of the avian world is surely a measure of our own identity against that of the wildness of nature. Some might dismiss these feelings as vestigial attachments, useful to us in an earlier phase of our evolution, irrelevant now. But, like the appendix and wisdom teeth, they're still very much part of us and losing them is traumatic.
That is probably why, in recent years, birds have become the barometers of environmental change, indicators of ecological quality: the warning bells of environmentalism. Conservationists in Britain cite the endangering of 30 species, a figure that is depressing not only because it spells out the loss of feathered curiosities, but because it is a massive cultural loss too.These birds carry a huge amount of cultural baggage. For example, the skylark, turtle dove and lapwing signify spiritual love, romantic love and magic. Anyone who has read Shelley's poems, Shakespeare's sonnets and Robert Graves's The White Goddess will feel more than a tug of remorse at the loss of these once commonplace birds.
Yet while the loss of these birds is lamented, the loss of others which don't figure in either literature or folklore is virtually ignored. Folklore is so important. The stories, legends and rhymes which persist through time, with their obscure origins, constant revisions and reinventions, somehow have a greater living bond with their subjects than cold, scientific terms a bond that is strengthened by the everyday language in which they are understood and communicated. This gives them a power to summon up feelings and attitudes from a consciousness buried under all the stuff of modern life.
Whether we watch wildlife films on TV or birdtables in the backyard, what were doing and the excitement we get from what we see cannot adequately be captured by scientific reason. Birds are engaging in ways we still find hard to fathom, let alone articulate, and so the stories we tell about them seem like ways of interpreting what birds are telling us.
The wren in the greenhouse weaves an intricate knot, tying an imaginary thread between the here and now and a deep, distant history, holding the free end in its song and escaping into the future - a riddle that keeps me guessing.
",C2,"People have always talked about birds. They love them, fear them, and worship them. This tells us something about humans. A small brown bird, a wren, is hitting a greenhouse window. Is it sending a message? Or is it just stuck? Both could be true. Wrens are important in British culture. Long ago, people thought wrens flying brought good or bad luck. Today, wrens are in pictures in homes. A forest without wrens is sad. People have old stories about birds. For example, the red kite bird was once protected in London. It took bread from children. Later, people saw it as a pest and killed it. Now, it is protected again. Birds are important to humans. They show us predators, weather, and food. Birds can fly and sing. We are fascinated by them. Some think this is old and not useful now, but it is still part of us. Birds now show if the environment is good or bad. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because we lose birds and culture. Birds like the skylark mean love and magic. When we lose them, we feel sad. But we ignore birds not in stories. Old stories about birds are strong. They help us feel things. We watch birds on TV or in gardens. It is exciting. We do not fully understand why birds are important. The wren in the greenhouse connects today with the past and future. It is a puzzle.","Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds, such as love, fear, and worship. This reflects something about us. A little brown wren is bumping against a greenhouse window. Is it giving a message from another world, or is it just trapped? Both ideas could be correct. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed the direction wrens flew predicted their luck. Now, wrens appear in pictures and ceramics in homes. Even if old beliefs are forgotten, wrens still hold a place in our minds and hearts. A wood without wrens feels empty and poor. This happens because there is rich folklore about birds from when people depended more on nature for survival. They developed a language to understand birds' importance, which changes over time. For instance, the red kite was once a protected bird in London that took bread from children. Later, it was seen as vermin and nearly died out, except in Wales. Now, it is a symbol of conservation and is being reintroduced. Our connection to birds goes back to human evolution. Early humans watched birds for signs of danger, weather, and food, and for spiritual links. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, and we envy them. Some say these feelings are outdated, but they remain part of us. Recently, birds have become indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are endangered, which is a cultural loss too. Birds like the skylark symbolize love and magic, and their loss is mourned in poetry. However, birds not in folklore are often ignored. Folklore stories are powerful because they create emotional bonds, unlike scientific terms. Whether watching birds on TV or in gardens, the excitement is hard to explain scientifically. Birds are mysterious, and our stories help interpret them. The wren in the greenhouse ties the present to history and the future, leaving a riddle.","Human culture has always expressed strong emotions towards birds, including love, fear, and worship, which reveals aspects of ourselves. A small brown wren is repeatedly hitting a greenhouse window. Could it be conveying a message from a mystical realm, or is it merely trapped? Both interpretations might be valid. Wrens have been woven into British culture since its beginnings. In medieval times, complex systems involved observing wren flight directions to predict luck. Today, wrens are depicted in household art and ceramics. Although early beliefs have faded, wrens still occupy a place in our consciousness and affections. A woodland devoid of wrens seems desolate and deprived. This stems from a rich tradition of folklore in our relationships with birds, dating back to eras when people interpreted nature differently for survival. They developed ecological and cultural languages to communicate the significance of creatures, though this significance shifts with cultural changes. A notable example is the red kite: in the 16th century, it was a protected urban scavenger in London, taking bread from children, but it later came to be viewed as vermin and was eradicated in most areas except Wales. Over time, it gained a romantic association with Celtic regions and is now a totem of conservation efforts, being reintroduced to restore its range. Our bond with birds extends beyond culture to human evolution. Early birdwatchers keenly observed bird behavior for warnings of predators, weather, and food, as well as spiritual connections. Birds embody flight, song, and freedom, evoking our fascination and envy, which some dismiss as evolutionary remnants but remain integral to our identity. In recent years, birds have become barometers of environmental change, indicating ecological quality. Conservationists report 30 endangered species in Britain, a depressing figure due to both biodiversity and cultural loss. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize spiritual love, romantic love, and magic, and their decline evokes remorse among readers of literature. Yet, birds absent from folklore are often overlooked. Folklore, with its enduring stories and rhymes, fosters a deeper emotional connection than scientific terminology, reinforced by everyday language. Whether through wildlife films or backyard birdwatching, the excitement defies full scientific explanation. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to comprehend or articulate, so our stories serve as interpretations. The wren in the greenhouse intricately links the present with a distant past and future, presenting an enduring enigma.","Human culture has perpetually articulated profound sentiments towards birds—ranging from adoration and trepidation to veneration—which in turn illuminates facets of our own nature. A diminutive brown wren is persistently striking a greenhouse pane; might it be articulating an omen from the fringes of imagination, or is it simply an unfortunate bird ensnared? Both perspectives could hold truth. Wrens have been integral to the fabric of British culture since its inception. During medieval epochs, intricate systems of augury involved interpreting the flight paths of wrens to foretell fortune. In contemporary times, the wren's image endures in domestic art and pottery. Even as primordial convictions have attenuated or been forgotten, the wren retains a foothold in our collective psyche and a niche in our emotional attachments. A sylvan environment bereft of wrens is a melancholy and impoverished locale. This phenomenon likely arises from a rich vein of folklore permeating our avian relationships, hearkening back to an era when humanity deciphered the natural world through a different lens, necessitated by direct reliance on ecological processes for survival. This fostered the development of an ecological and cultural lexicon through which the import of other species was conveyed—a significance susceptible to cultural transformations that alter perceptions. The red kite exemplifies this: in the early 16th century, it was a safeguarded urban scavenger in London, astonishing visitors by seizing bread from children, yet it soon became vilified as vermin and was extirpated from most regions save Wales. Gradually, it assumed a romantic persona tied to Celtic heritage and has now emerged as an emblematic figure in British conservation, being reintroduced to reestablish its historical distribution. Our rapport with birds transcends mere cultural constructs, delving into the evolution of human nature. Although primordial birdwatchers may have been acutely observant of avian behavior for its indications of impending predators, inclement weather, and food availability, as well as its supernatural linkages to the dream realm, there is a deeper dimension. When we ponder why birds captivate us, we are essentially interrogating human identity. Flight, melody, liberty—our captivation, envy, and emulation of the avian domain undoubtedly gauge our own essence against nature's wildness. Some may relegate these sentiments as vestigial attachments from an earlier evolutionary phase, now irrelevant, yet they persist as intrinsic components of our being, and their loss would be traumatic. Consequently, in recent decades, birds have become barometers of environmental alteration and indicators of ecological integrity—the alarm bells of environmentalism. Conservationists in Britain cite the endangerment of 30 species, a disheartening statistic not only due to the extinction of feathered wonders but also because it signifies a substantial cultural depletion. These birds bear considerable cultural weight; for instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing epitomize spiritual love, amorous affection, and enchantment. Those acquainted with Shelley's verse, Shakespeare's sonnets, or Graves's 'The White Goddess' experience profound regret at the loss of these once-ubiquitous birds. Nonetheless, while the demise of such birds is lamented, species absent from literature and folklore are largely disregarded. Folklore is paramount; the narratives, legends, and rhymes that persist through time, with their obscure origins and continual reinterpretations, forge a more vital bond with their subjects than sterile scientific terminology—a connection amplified by the vernacular in which they are comprehended and transmitted. This endows them with the power to evoke emotions and attitudes from a consciousness buried beneath modern life's clutter. Whether we observe wildlife documentaries or backyard bird feeders, the activities and exhilaration we derive cannot be fully encapsulated by scientific rationale. Birds engage us in manners that remain elusive to fathom, let alone articulate, thus the tales we weave about them function as interpretations of what birds communicate. The wren in the greenhouse weaves an intricate knot, binding the immediate present to a profound, distant history, clutching the loose end in its carol and vanishing into the future—a conundrum that perpetually puzzles.","Human culture has invariably expressed profound affections, fears, and devotions towards birds, which in turn reflects intrinsic aspects of our own identity. A diminutive brown wren is repeatedly colliding with a greenhouse window; could it be conveying a portent from the peripheries of imagination, or is it merely an entrapped avian? Both interpretations may hold validity. Wrens have been perennially embedded in the undergrowth of British culture since its dawn. In medieval times, elaborate systems of augury involved scrutinizing the trajectories of wren flight to divine the observer's fortune. In the modern era, the wren's visage persists in domestic iconography and ceramics. Although archaic beliefs may have attenuated or dissipated, the wren still occupies a perch in our collective consciousness and a nest in our affections. A woodland devoid of wrens is a lamentably impoverished space. This is likely attributable to a rich vein of folklore that permeates our relationships with numerous birds, tracing back to epochs when humanity interpreted the natural world through a distinct paradigm, necessitated by a direct tether to ecological processes for survival. This engendered an ecological and cultural lexicon through which the significance of other creatures is communicated—a significance prone to cultural shifts that precipitate substantial image alterations. The red kite serves as a salient illustration: during the early sixteenth century, it was a protected urban scavenger in London, astonishing foreign visitors by swooping to procure bread from children's hands, yet it soon became stigmatized as vermin and was consequently eradicated from most locales except Wales. Gradually, the red kite assumed a romantic persona associated with this Celtic bastion and has now become a totemic symbol of British conservation, being reintroduced with the objective of restoring its ancestral distribution. Our relationship with birds transcends cultural dimensions, delving into the evolution of human nature. Though primordial birdwatchers may have been acutely observant of avian behavior for its announcements of approaching predators, adverse weather, and food availability, as well as its supernatural linkages to the realm of dreams, there is a deeper existential inquiry. When we question why birds are so pivotal to us, we are simultaneously probing the essence of humanity. Flight, song, freedom—our fascination, envy, and emulation of the avian world undoubtedly serve as a measure of our own identity juxtaposed against nature's wildness. Some might dismiss these sentiments as vestigial attachments, pertinent in an earlier evolutionary phase but now obsolete; however, akin to the appendix and wisdom teeth, they remain integral to our being, and their excision would be traumatic. This is presumably why, in recent years, birds have emerged as barometers of environmental change and indicators of ecological quality—the clarion calls of environmentalism. Conservationists in Britain cite the imperilment of thirty species, a disheartening figure not only because it heralds the loss of ornithological curiosities but also because it constitutes a profound cultural forfeiture. These birds carry substantial cultural baggage; for instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing signify spiritual love, romantic love, and magic, respectively. Those versed in Shelley's poetry, Shakespeare's sonnets, and Graves's 'The White Goddess' experience more than a pang of remorse at the demise of these once-commonplace birds. Yet, while the loss of such birds is mourned, the extinction of others that lack literary or folkloric representation is virtually ignored. Folklore is of paramount importance; the stories, legends, and rhymes that endure through time, with their obscure origins, constant revisions, and reinventions, somehow foster a more vital connection with their subjects than austere scientific terminology—a bond fortified by the quotidian language in which they are apprehended and conveyed. This confers upon them the power to summon emotions and attitudes from a consciousness submerged beneath the detritus of modern existence. Whether we engage with wildlife films or observe birdtables in our gardens, the activities and exhilaration we experience cannot be adequately captured by scientific reason. Birds engage us in manners that remain inscrutable to fathom, let alone articulate, and thus the narratives we construct about them function as hermeneutic tools for interpreting avian communications. The wren in the greenhouse weaves an intricate knot, tethering the immediacy of the present to a deep, distant history, clutching the free terminus in its melody and escaping into the future—a riddle that perpetually eludes resolution.","Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds.

Birds are engaging in ways we still find hard to fathom, let alone articulate, and so the stories we tell about them seem like ways of interpreting what birds are telling us.
The wren in the greenhouse weaves an intricate knot, tying an imaginary thread between the here and now and a deep, distant history, holding the free end in its song and escaping into the future - a riddle that keeps me guessing.

310,"Citizen Kane

When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor's fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst, its alleged subject, might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. It is perhaps the one film, above all others, that has inspired people to become film-makers. This is all the more astonishing since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles always maintained that its success arose from his having no idea of what he was or wasn't allowed to do: he just went ahead and did it. But he had an extraordinary team at his disposal, cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and the special-effects wizard Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz hit on the idea of portraying a newspaper magnate who both was and wasn't Hearst, Welles realised that he had found a perfect vehicle for himself both as director and actor, and seized his chance with the energy of a whirlwind.

Dermot and Carmel

Dermot thought that Carmel was rather odd that morning. Twice he had said that he might be late and not to worry if he dropped into the golf club on the way home. He had to have a natter with someone and that was the best place to have it. Twice she had nodded her head amiably and distantly as if she hadn't really heard or understood. 
'Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?' he had asked.
She had smiled. 'Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I hadn't anything to do all day so I was going to stroll down town and look at the shops. I was thinking that it was almost a sinful thing, just idling away the day.'
Dermot had smiled back. 'You're entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I""m late I won't want anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble.'
'No, that's fine.' she said.

Human nature provides the most divine of comedies. Witness a recent study which has informed the nation that job titles are a prime cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a leading firm of recruitment consultants found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues.
Most shockingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to forgo a pay rise in favour of a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our vanity is reaching such proportions that even basic greed is being overwhelmed, we are indeed in dire straits.
The truth is that in these brave new days of the early twenty-first century, nobody is content to be labelled subordinate. The titles under discussion place the emphasis on ability (specialist, coordinator) but are, in fact, little more than euphemisms.",C2,"The film Citizen Kane came out in 1941. It was not a big success when it first came out. Later, TV made it popular again. It is a very important film that makes people want to make films. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. He said he did not know the rules, so he just did what he wanted. He had a great team to help him. They had the idea to show a newspaper boss who was like William Randolph Hearst. Welles saw it was perfect for him as director and actor, and he worked very hard. Dermot thought Carmel was strange that morning. He said he might be late and go to the golf club. She did not seem to listen. He asked if she would be okay and what she would do. She said she had nothing to do, so she would go to the shops. She said it felt wrong to do nothing all day. He said she should have fun and not make food if he was late. She said that was fine. A study says job titles make people at work jealous and unhappy. A survey found that 90% of bosses and 70% of workers say titles cause problems. It also found that 70% of office workers would not take more money if they got a better job title. This shows people care a lot about titles. Today, no one wants to be called a helper. New titles sound good but do not mean much.","The film Citizen Kane was released in 1941. It was not a commercial success at first, even with good reviews. Television later brought it back to public attention. It is one of the most inspiring films for people who want to make movies. This is amazing because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said its success came from him not knowing what he was allowed to do; he just did it. He had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to portray a newspaper magnate similar to William Randolph Hearst, Welles knew it was perfect for him as director and actor, and he took the chance with great energy. Dermot thought Carmel was acting oddly that morning. He told her twice that he might be late and could stop at the golf club. She nodded but seemed not to pay attention. He asked if she would be all right and what she planned to do. She smiled and said she had nothing to do, so she would walk to town and look in shops, thinking it was almost sinful to idle the day away. Dermot smiled back and said she deserved to enjoy herself and not to prepare food if he was late. She agreed. A recent study shows that job titles cause envy and unrest at work. A survey by a recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit titles create divisions. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers would give up a pay rise for a more motivational job title. This indicates that vanity is overcoming greed. Nowadays, no one is happy with a subordinate label. The new titles focus on ability but are often just euphemisms.","When Citizen Kane was released in 1941, it was not a commercial success, despite the excitement around its launch and positive reviews. Its release was delayed due to fears about William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the subject of the film. Television later revived public interest in it. It is perhaps the film that has most inspired people to become film-makers, which is remarkable as it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles claimed that its success stemmed from his ignorance of film-making rules; he simply proceeded without constraints. He had an exceptional team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz conceived the idea of depicting a newspaper magnate inspired by Hearst, Welles realized it was an ideal project for him as both director and actor, and he pursued it with immense energy. Dermot found Carmel rather odd that morning. He mentioned twice that he might be late and could visit the golf club, but she responded with distant nods as if not fully comprehending. He inquired if she would be all right and what she intended to do. She smiled and remarked that it was funny he asked, as she had planned to stroll downtown and browse shops, feeling it was almost sinful to spend the day idling. Dermot reassured her that she deserved to enjoy herself and not to bother with food if he was late, to which she agreed. Human nature often provides comedy, as seen in a recent study indicating that job titles are a major source of envy and unrest in workplaces. A survey by a leading recruitment firm revealed that 90% of employers and 70% of employees acknowledge that titles cause divisions. Most shockingly, 70% of office workers would forgo a pay rise in exchange for a more motivational job title, suggesting that vanity is surpassing basic greed. In the early twenty-first century, no one is content with subordinate labels. The titles in question emphasize ability but are essentially euphemisms.","Upon its release in 1941, Citizen Kane did not achieve commercial success, notwithstanding the considerable publicity and largely ecstatic reviews that accompanied it; its launch was delayed owing to distributors' apprehensions about William Randolph Hearst, the alleged subject, potentially causing them harm. It was television that subsequently restored it to public consciousness. This film stands out as perhaps the most influential in motivating individuals to pursue careers in film-making, which is particularly astonishing given that it was Orson Welles's inaugural film. Welles consistently asserted that its triumph originated from his lack of awareness regarding permissible actions; he merely proceeded without inhibition. He was supported by an extraordinary team, comprising cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects wizard Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz devised the concept of portraying a newspaper magnate who both mirrored and diverged from Hearst, Welles recognized it as a perfect vehicle for his roles as director and actor, and he seized the opportunity with whirlwind energy. Dermot perceived Carmel as somewhat peculiar that morning. He had twice stated that he might be late and could drop into the golf club on his way home, noting it was an ideal place for a chat. On both occasions, she nodded amiably yet distantly, as if she had not fully registered or understood. He asked if she would be all right and what she planned to do that day. She smiled and commented that it was amusing he inquired, as she had been reflecting on having no obligations and intended to amble downtown to peruse the shops, musing that such idleness felt almost sinful. Dermot reciprocated the smile, affirming her entitlement to enjoyment and reiterating that if he were late, he would not require a meal, so she should not trouble herself. She concurred that it was fine. Human nature furnishes the most divine comedies, exemplified by a recent study revealing that job titles are a primary cause of envy and unrest in professional settings. A survey conducted by a prominent recruitment consultancy found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles foster divisions among colleagues. Most shockingly, the survey indicated that 70% of office workers would relinquish a pay rise in favor of a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title, implying that vanity has escalated to the point of overwhelming fundamental greed. In these contemporary times, no individual is satisfied with being labelled subordinate. The titles under discussion accentuate ability but are, in reality, little more than euphemisms.","When Citizen Kane finally premiered in 1941, it failed to attain commercial success, despite the brouhaha surrounding its release—which was delayed due to distributors' fears of reprisals from William Randolph Hearst, its alleged subject—and the largely ecstatic critical reception. It was television that subsequently resurrected it in the public consciousness. This film is arguably the paramount inspiration for aspiring film-makers, a fact rendered all the more astonishing by its status as Orson Welles's cinematic debut. Welles perpetually maintained that its achievement derived from his ignorance of cinematic conventions; he merely forged ahead unimpeded. He commanded an extraordinary ensemble, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects virtuoso Linwood Dunn. Upon Welles and Mankiewicz conceiving the notion of depicting a newspaper magnate who simultaneously embodied and diverged from Hearst, Welles apprehended that he had discovered an ideal vehicle for his dual roles as director and actor, and he capitalized on the opportunity with the energy of a whirlwind. Dermot surmised that Carmel was rather peculiar that morning. He had twice articulated that he might be tardy and could drop into the golf club en route home, as it was the optimal venue for a natter. On both occasions, she nodded amiably and distantly, as if she had not genuinely apprehended or processed the information. He inquired whether she would be all right and what her plans for the day entailed. She smiled and remarked that it was amusing he should ask, as she had been contemplating her lack of engagements and intended to stroll downtown to peruse the shops, reflecting that such idleness verged on the sinful. Dermot reciprocated the smile, asserting her entitlement to enjoyment and reiterating that if he were late, he would not necessitate sustenance, so she should eschew any culinary efforts. She acquiesced, stating it was fine. Human nature proffers the most divine of comedies, as evidenced by a recent study elucidating that job titles constitute a prime catalyst for envy and unrest in occupational environments. A survey orchestrated by a leading firm of recruitment consultants disclosed that 90% of employers and 70% of employees concede that titles engender divisions among colleagues. Most shockingly, the survey ascertained that 70% of office personnel would be willing to forgo a pay rise in favor of a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title, intimating that vanity has burgeoned to such proportions that it supersedes elemental greed. In these brave new days of the early twenty-first century, no one is content to be stigmatized as subordinate. The titles under scrutiny emphasize ability but are, in essence, scarcely more than euphemisms.","Citizen Kane

311,"Writing by hand and on screen

Dr Johnson maintained that 'what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure'. The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. I am sure the reason was that they were physically hard to write. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. What would be difficult to alter or erase was written with care. The casual facility of the computer leads to sloppiness. Most writers using word processors find the time spent correcting early drafts more or less equates with the time originally spent on handwritten text.
Equally, the e-mail, unlike the handwritten letter, is emotionally ponderous. This electronic Eros is said to have revive the art of the love letter. Millions of these missives now flow down the lines, where previously there was only idle chatter. Hurrah for that. At least these e-mails are written, in a sort of English and a sort of grammar: But words printed on a screen pack a monotonous punch. Their writers are often unaccustomed to the power of the written word and tend, in computer jargon, to 'flare'. Their meaning becomes exaggerated and distorted in transmission. And printed words written in haste lack the care and character of handwriting.

The CD

I put down my cup and went to inspect the CD. The case was disappointing but the rainbow-silver disc inside looked interesting.
'Wonderful little things, aren't they?' Mr Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed, gingerly handing the disc to him. 'Amazing they manage to squeeze seventy minutes of music onto them,' he continued, bending to the hi-fi device. He switched it on and all sorts of lights came on. He pressed a button and a little drawer slid out of the machine. He put the disc inside, pressed the button again and the tray glided back in again. 'Of course, some people say they sound sterile, but I think they...'
'Do you have to turn them over, like records?' I asked.
'What? No,' Mr Warriston said, straightening. 'No, you only play one side.'
'Why?' I asked him.
He looked nonplussed, and then thoughtful. 'You know,' he said, 'I've no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity...' He stared down at the machine. 'You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm.' He smiled at me. 'Yes, good point.' He nodded over at my wooden chair. 'Anyway. Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, eh?'
I smiled, pleased to have thought of a technical question Mr Warriston could not answer.

Books versus Electronic Text

In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury was spot on when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we'd have marvelled at the improvement. Most of the propaganda, dazzled by newness, states that electronic text is a change comparable to the invention of printing and that it is already nearly completed. It ignores the fact that shifts in consciousness take generations and such rhetoric falls into the trap of chronocentricity, the egotism that one's own generation sits on the very cusp of history. Take this treasure from Mighty Micro, a book from 1979: 'The 1980s will see the book as we know it, and as our ancestors created and cherished it, begin a slow and steady slide to oblivion.' So far, so wrong. Reading anything lengthy on a screen is such a miserable experience that most never do it and, in any case, the organisation of what resides in computers encourages people to dip into text. Techno-proselytisers have extracted virtue here by claiming that inherent flightiness leads to new forms of narrative and imaginative space. But there's nothing new about 'non-linearity'. Lots of books have never been read from beginning to end - most religious texts, dictionaries and poetry collections spring to mind. What is new is not so much the branchings of electronic text as that computers don't invite the joined-up thinking of reading anything in its entirety.

The Office

Charles Walked through the office door and into a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of the paper avalanche which had buried it on the very day it was put down, and the naked desk was dark wood, just as he remembered it from the Sotheby's auction of five weeks ago. Neat file-holders were being put in their proper drawers. Twelve years of trade journals now filled the shelves on one wall.
Kathleen strained to close the door of the filing cabinet and then turned on him. 'You have to go to computers, Charles. This is just too much.'
'Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing.' He was admiring the room, its antique furniture. He was not visualising a computer or any other mechanical device in it, not even a pencil sharpener. 'Simply amazing,' he said, altogether skirting the issue of computers.
Over the two years he had known her, they'd had this conversation many times. She could never understand his resistance to the technology when he was so adept at computers and had even published an important paper on computer-mode giftedness. She had been the inspiration for that paper. Via the keyboard, she could dip her fingers into the stuffing of any software and make it into a new animal that could sit up and bark at the moon if she wished.",C2,Writing by hand is slow and careful. Writing on a computer is fast and can be messy. Emails are not like handwritten letters. They can be too emotional and not clear. CDs are small discs that play music. You put them in a machine to listen. Books are better for reading long texts. Screens are not good for long reading. Charles likes his old office with paper. He does not want computers. His friend Kathleen wants computers.,"Writing by hand takes time and makes you think carefully. Writing on a computer is easy but can lead to mistakes. Emails are common now, but they often use strong words and can be misunderstood. CDs hold music and you play them in a hi-fi. You do not turn them over. Books are comfortable to read. Reading on a screen is hard for long texts. Charles has a tidy office with old furniture. He avoids computers, even though he is good with them. Kathleen thinks he should use computers.","Handwriting is slow and requires effort, which helps people write more carefully. In contrast, writing on a computer is quick and can result in careless work. Emails have become popular for personal messages, but they often lack the emotional depth of handwritten letters and can exaggerate feelings. CDs are used for music playback; they are inserted into a player and only one side is used, unlike records. Books are preferred for lengthy reading because screens make it uncomfortable, and computers encourage skipping through text rather than reading fully. Charles appreciates his organized office with traditional items and resists using computers, despite his expertise, while Kathleen urges him to adopt modern technology.","Dr Johnson believed that effortless writing is seldom enjoyable to read, implying that quality writing demands hard work. Handwriting, being slow, imposes discipline on the writer, whereas the ease of computer use often leads to sloppiness and extensive revisions. Emails, though reviving personal correspondence, tend to be emotionally intense and prone to distortion, lacking the refinement of handwritten letters. CDs provide high-quality music storage without the need to flip sides, raising questions about design choices. Books offer a superior reading experience for extended texts compared to electronic screens, which promote fragmented reading. Critics often overstate the impact of new technologies, ignoring gradual societal changes. Charles values his orderly, antique-furnished office and deliberately avoids computers, despite his proficiency, much to Kathleen's frustration.","Dr Johnson asserted that writing composed without exertion is typically read without enjoyment, suggesting that proficient writing necessitates considerable effort. The deliberate pace of handwriting imposes cognitive discipline, fostering careful composition, in contrast to the casual facility of word processors, which often results in negligence and protracted revisions. Although email has rejuvenated the art of personal correspondence, it tends to be emotionally ponderous and susceptible to hyperbole, diminishing the nuanced character of handwritten missives. Compact discs, with their single-sided playback, represent an advance in audio technology, though their design invites scrutiny regarding potential enhancements. In the realm of text, books remain preferable for sustained reading, as electronic media encourage superficial engagement rather than comprehensive absorption, a phenomenon exacerbated by chronocentric rhetoric that overstates technological shifts. Charles, adept in computing yet resistant to its integration, cherishes his meticulously ordered office with antique furnishings, consistently evading Kathleen's appeals to modernize, highlighting a paradox between his expertise and personal preferences.","Writing by hand and on screen

312,"The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. The way one picture, a single snapshot, could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, a human being, was embedded in my consciousness.
One day, one second, I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera. Finish one, load another, and keep looking, with eyes wide open. That was my code. Had been for a long time.
I'd come close once, when some weird aptness in the knotted shape of a smoke plume from a burning oil well made my picture the one newspapers and magazines all over the world suddenly wanted. Brief glory from an even briefer moment. Just luck, really. But they say you make your own - the bad as well as the good.
I went freelance after that, which should have been a clever move and would probably have worked out that way, but for life beyond the lens taking a few wrong turnings. The mid-nineties weren't quite the string of triumphs I'd foreseen when my defining image made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than anywhere even faintly newsworthy.
But, still, I was taking photographs. And I was being paid to do it. It didn't sound bad to me. The assignment was actually a piece of happenstance. I'd done the London shots for a glossy coffee-table picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, a European co-publishing venture that netted me a juicy commission to hang round moody locations in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I'd given my own particular slant to daffodils in Hyde Park and heat haze and traffic fumes in Piccadilly.
I'd also reconciled myself to the best and truest of what I'd delivered being tossed aside. It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn't meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.
It was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute's role.
The Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren't great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn't have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.
They put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I'd last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn't even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.
I knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.
The first day I didn't even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn't wanted to.
This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.
Next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn't figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there's always been something magical about photography.
It certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.
And even when you know why it happens you don't lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning failed in some strange way to surprise me.",C2,"I was in Vienna to take pictures. I am a photographer. I take photos for my job and because I love it. I like how light looks in photos. One photo can show a time and a place. I always try to take the perfect photo. I have my camera with me. I take many photos. Once, I took a photo of smoke from a fire. Many newspapers wanted that photo. After that, I worked for myself. But things did not go well. Now, I am in Vienna for a job. I am happy to be here. I am staying in a hotel. I was in Vienna before with my wife. It was a busy trip. Now, I am alone in winter. I think I will take good photos. On the first day, I rode trams and looked around. The weather was cold. I waited for the right moment to take photos. The next morning, I went out early. There was snow. I wanted to take a photo of a big church. It was hard to take one photo of the whole church. But I thought it could still be a nice photo. Photography is like magic. It is always special to see a photo appear.","I was in Vienna to take photographs. Photography is my job and my passion. I enjoy how light creates images. A single photo can capture a moment or a place perfectly. I always hope to take the perfect picture. I keep my camera ready. Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. It became famous in newspapers and magazines. After that, I started working freelance. But my life had some problems, so I did not have much success. That is why I was in Vienna for a job. The job happened by chance. I had taken photos for a book about London. Then, the photographer for Vienna left, so they asked me to do it. I was happy to go because things at home were not good. I stayed in a hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy tourist trip. Now, I was alone in cold January. I felt I would take good photos here. On the first day, I rode trams and explored the city. The weather was very cold. I waited patiently for the right photo opportunities. The next morning, I went out early after snow had fallen. I tried to photograph a large cathedral, but it was too big for one shot. I thought I could still take a beautiful photo. Photography has a magical quality, even when you know how it works.","I was in Vienna on a photography assignment. Photography is not just my livelihood; it is a central part of my life. I am fascinated by how light can inspire me and how a single photograph can encapsulate the essence of a time, place, or person. I am always searching for that perfect shot, reloading my camera and staying observant. Once, I achieved brief fame with a photograph of smoke from a burning oil well, which was widely published. After that, I went freelance, but personal issues prevented the success I had hoped for in the mid-nineties. That is why I was in Vienna instead of a more prominent location. This assignment came about by chance after I completed work on a picture book about London. The original Vienna photographer left, and I was offered the job because the publishers liked my work and I was available. I was eager to go, as my home situation was difficult. I stayed at a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife on a hectic summer trip, but this time, alone in winter, I felt it would be different. Upon arrival, I was inspired by the snowy scene and knew I would enjoy myself and take great photos. On the first day, I explored the city by tram, absorbing its atmosphere in the frozen weather. I waited patiently for the right moments to photograph. The next morning, I went out early to a snowy square to photograph the cathedral, though its size made a single shot challenging. Photography has always seemed magical to me, a mystery that remains even when you understand the process, which may explain why I was not entirely surprised by what happened that morning.","I was in Vienna undertaking a photography assignment. For me, photographs transcend mere livelihood; they are an integral aspect of my existence. The interplay of light on surfaces consistently sparks my imagination, and the capacity of a single snapshot to capture the quintessence of a moment, location, or individual is deeply ingrained in my consciousness. I perpetually aspire to capture the perfect photograph, maintaining my camera ready and remaining vigilant. On one occasion, I came close with an image of a peculiarly shaped smoke plume from a burning oil well, which garnered international attention in newspapers and magazines—a fleeting glory born from serendipity. Subsequently, I transitioned to freelance work, which should have been advantageous, but extraneous life circumstances impeded my anticipated triumphs in the mid-nineties, leading me to Vienna for this assignment. This opportunity arose fortuitously after I contributed to a co-published picture book on European cities; when the Austrian photographer withdrew, I was selected as a replacement due to the publishers' appreciation of my previous work and my availability. I accepted readily, as my domestic situation was unsatisfactory. Accommodated in a hotel in the historic center, I reflected on a prior visit to Vienna with my wife, which had been a crowded and unmemorable summer excursion. Alone in the austere January cold, I immediately sensed a difference and felt optimistic about producing exceptional photographs. I spent the initial day acclimating to the city via tram rides, observing the steadfast, frozen ambiance reminiscent of the bygone empire. I bided my time, awaiting propitious moments. At dawn the following day, I ventured to a snow-covered square to photograph the cathedral, though its monumental scale posed a compositional challenge. Photography retains an element of enchantment for me, a perennial mystery that persists despite technical comprehension, which perhaps accounts for my lack of astonishment at the events that unfolded that morning.","I was in Vienna to execute a photographic assignment, wherein photography constituted not only my profession but a fundamental component of my being. The manner in which illumination interacts with surfaces perpetually stimulates my creative faculties, and the potential for a solitary image to encapsulate the intrinsic nature of a temporal and spatial context, a metropolis, or an individual is profoundly embedded within my psyche. I am ceaselessly in pursuit of the quintessential photograph, operating under the principle of perpetual readiness and acute observation. On a prior occasion, I approximated this ideal with a photograph of an anomalously configured smoke plume emanating from a combusting oil well, which precipitated its adoption by periodicals globally—an ephemeral acclaim derived from a transient instance of fortune. Following this, I embarked upon a freelance career, a decision that ostensibly should have yielded success, yet was undermined by vicissitudes in my personal life, thus accounting for my presence in Vienna rather than a more conspicuous locale. This engagement materialized serendipitously subsequent to my involvement in a lavishly illustrated tome detailing European cities across seasons; upon the departure of the designated Austrian photographer, I was enlisted as a substitute, owing to the publishers' approbation of my oeuvre and my unencumbered schedule. I acquiesced with alacrity, motivated by adverse circumstances domestically. Residing at a hotel in the ancient city's core, I reminisced about a previous sojourn with my spouse, which had been a frenetic and ultimately forgettable summer itinerary. In solitude during the rigorous January chill, I immediately discerned a transformative potential and anticipated both personal gratification and the creation of distinguished imagery. I devoted the inaugural day to perambulating the city via tram, assimilating the immutable, frigid atmosphere that echoed the grandiose remnants of a defunct empire. I exercised patience, permitting the opportune instants to manifest. At daybreak the subsequent morning, I proceeded to a pristine, snow-laden square to photograph the cathedral, notwithstanding the architectural impediment of its disproportionate dimensions. Photography has invariably possessed a mystical dimension for me—an ineffable quality that endures irrespective of mechanistic understanding, which may elucidate my peculiar lack of surprise at the occurrences that transpired that morning.","The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. The way one picture, a single snapshot, could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, a human being, was embedded in my consciousness.
One day, one second, I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera. Finish one, load another, and keep looking, with eyes wide open. That was my code. Had been for a long time.
I'd come close once, when some weird aptness in the knotted shape of a smoke plume from a burning oil well made my picture the one newspapers and magazines all over the world suddenly wanted. Brief glory from an even briefer moment. Just luck, really. But they say you make your own - the bad as well as the good.
I went freelance after that, which should have been a clever move and would probably have worked out that way, but for life beyond the lens taking a few wrong turnings. The mid-nineties weren't quite the string of triumphs I'd foreseen when my defining image made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than anywhere even faintly newsworthy.
But, still, I was taking photographs. And I was being paid to do it. It didn't sound bad to me. The assignment was actually a piece of happenstance. I'd done the London shots for a glossy coffee-table picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, a European co-publishing venture that netted me a juicy commission to hang round moody locations in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I'd given my own particular slant to daffodils in Hyde Park and heat haze and traffic fumes in Piccadilly.
I'd also reconciled myself to the best and truest of what I'd delivered being tossed aside. It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn't meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.
It was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute's role.
The Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren't great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn't have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.
They put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I'd last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn't even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.
I knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.
The first day I didn't even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn't wanted to.
This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.
Next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn't figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there's always been something magical about photography.
It certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.
And even when you know why it happens you don't lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning failed in some strange way to surprise me."
313,"Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake within a year of his and Lois's moving in. A possession which can only be afforded by the exercise of stringent and calculated economy is best not afforded at all. But at the time it had seemed a sensible, as well as a desirable, move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand. It was Lois who had argued the more strongly for a move, but he had put up little resistance to arguments which at the time had seemed compelling: the flat wasn't really suitable for a family, they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these, of course, could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. Mornington Mansions had never been an acceptable address for an up-and-coming young barrister and a successful businesswoman. She never said it without a sense that even speaking the words subtly diminished her standing, socially and economically.
Lois had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise. The overcrowded tube journey, stayed in a mood of envious resentment, had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He would recall his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner from the kitchen, his grandmother's insistence that the returning breadwinner, tired from his exhausting day in court, should be given peace, a little gentle cosseting, and relief from every petty domestic anxiety. She had been a 'lawyer's wife', indefatigable in legal good causes, elegantly present at all lawyers' functions, apparently content with the sphere of life which she had made her own. Well, that world had passed for ever. Lois had made it plain before their marriage that her career was as important as his. It hardly needed saying, this was, after all, a modern marriage. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.
Venetia must have come straight from the court to their offices and she had been in a dangerous mood. Something or someone had upset her. But the word 'upset' was too weak, too bland for the intensity of furious disgust with which she had confronted him. Someone had driven her to the limit of her endurance. He cursed himself.

Probably nothing. The morning might have brought sense. He remembered every word of her angry accusations.
'I defended Brian Cartwright today. Successfully. He told me that when you were his counsel four years ago you knew before trial that he had bribed three of the jury. You did nothing. You went on with the case. Is that true?'
'He's lying. It isn't true.'
'He also said that he passed over some shares in his company to your fiancee. Also before trial. Is that true?'
'I tell you, he's lying. None of its true.'
The denial had been as instinctive as an arm raised to ward off a blow and had sounded unconvincing even to his own ears. His whole action had been one of guilt. The first cold horror draining his face was succeeded by a hot flush, bringing back shameful memories of his headmaster's study, of the terror of the inevitable punishment. He had made himself look into her eyes and had seen the look of contemptuous disbelief. If only he'd had some warning.

Affording it required stringent economy, rendering it impractical. At the time, it appeared sensible due to Simon's steady legal successes and Lois's return to her advertising career with a salary increase. Lois advocated strongly for the move to gain more room and a garden, desiring a prestigious address. Simon's tube commute fostered resentment, and he nostalgically recalled his grandfather's tranquil Hampstead home. Lois emphasised the equality of their careers, essential for their lifestyle. Venetia confronted Simon directly after court, alleging he had prior knowledge of jury bribery and improper share transfers in a past case. His denials seemed guilty, and he agonised over the potential career ruin if she publicised the accusations.","Simon Costello ascertained that the acquisition of the residence in Pembroke Square constituted an error within a year of his and Lois's relocation.

Lois had argued fervently for the move, seeking ample space and a garden, while aspiring to a more fashionable address. Simon's overcrowded tube journeys engendered envious resentment, evoking memories of his grandfather's serene Hampstead household. Lois asserted the parity of their careers, fundamental to their standard of living.

314,"Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production, and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results.
All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Too Much Choice

Society is becoming 'overchoiced'. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins.
Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep track of.

McAndrews Hotel

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition, instigated by my grandmother, and by now it has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting.

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production, and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results.
All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Too Much Choice

Society is becoming 'overchoiced'. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins.
Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep track of.

315,"The Actor's Craft

Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they're compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' But instead they all too easily fall into ponderous cliches, silly truisms or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. We should all pay heed to what Paul Scofield said in a letter to a friend of mine: 'I have found that an actor's work has life and interest only in its execution. It seems to wither away in discussion and become emptily theoretical and insubstantial. It has no rules (except perhaps audibility). With every play and every playwright the actor starts from scratch, as if he or she knows nothing and proceeds to learn afresh every time growing with the relationships of the characters and the insights of the writer. When the play has finished its run, he's empty until the next time. And its the emptiness which is, I find, apparent in any discussion of theatre work.'

A review of Hamlet

Adrian Lester's Hamlet is poised precariously between boyhood and manhood, and it is a performance of thrilling simplicity and assurance. His handling of the text and his physical and psychological self-control take him, in one leap, from brilliantly promising to frontline player: an actor with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing. Lester plays an edgy, tetchy young man who feeds on a banked-down sense of anger, agile, watchful and driven, he deploys a sense of acid wit and generous humour that makes him both formidable and lovable. Although played down, the virtuosity of this performance is unmistakable. Observe Lester's body, the way his arms hang stiffly, giving you a sense of a figure waiting to be animated. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives you a similar feeling of a body being moved by an inner force that he both knows and does not know. So what is acting? What is behaviour? Is the former an imitation or an evocation of the latter? Who and what animates these bodies, morally and physically? That is the central question about the life of the theatre.

One director's approach to rehearsal

The first stage of this director's rehearsal process is known as 'dropping in', a procedure which goes something like this. The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, finding out what effect the words are having. When if is their turn to speak, they glance of the screen, digest the first phrase, think about what it means to them, wait to find the impulse - the reason to speak - then speak. For example, the line is, 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?; Breathe. Let the thought drop in with your breath. A memory, a vision, an impression. Some people will imagine a queue, maybe at a bus stop on the way to rehearsals or for a rock concert in their youth. Having visualised the scene, find the impulse to speak it - what this director calls 'The pathway to the line'. Impulses can come from without or within. Look in the eyes of the other actor listening. Consider your character's situation. This director talks of 'dropping in' as a means of finding out what is going on. Don't pre-plan or pre-judge. Dare to go down there with an empty mind and trust that something will happen to you.

The Perfect Theatre

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. Going to the theatre, going to any live performance, is an event and the staff need to have a sense of that, too. It's terribly alienating if you feel that its just any old job for the people working front of house.
The theatre itself needs to create a relationship between the performer and the audience - no one in the audience should feel that they're getting an unreasonably prejudiced view of the actor. It's important that they're not too far away, they can hear, they can see, they can feel in some sense in contact with what's going on on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it because you can't deny the human form at the heart of drama. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage.
I like theatres that have a sense of the past in them. Like worn stone steps in a church, you get the sense of layers of human presence. From the point of view of the plays, you can't have something for everybody. You cant second-guess an audience because they don't know what they're going to want to see. When you visit the theatre, you want something done in a way you can't imagine, otherwise you may as well have stayed at home.",C2,"Actors sometimes get bad words from people. This happens when actors talk about their work in interviews. They should say what a dancer once said: 'If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it.' But actors often use boring or silly words. We should listen to what actor Paul Scofield said. He said an actor's work is only alive when they are doing it. Talking about it makes it weak. There are no rules, except to speak clearly. For every play, actors start new and learn again. When the play ends, they feel empty until the next one. This emptiness shows when they talk about their work. In a play of Hamlet, Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man between boy and adult. His acting is simple and sure. He is very good with words and his body. He seems angry but also funny, so people like him. His body looks stiff, like it is waiting to move. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio and also seems moved from inside. This makes us ask: What is acting? Is it copying life? Who makes these bodies move? That is a big question in theatre. One director has a way to practice called 'dropping in'. Actors sit and listen to words. When they speak, they look at the words on a screen, think about what they mean, and wait for a reason to speak. For example, for the line 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?', they breathe and let a thought come, like a memory. They imagine a scene, like waiting in line, and then speak. The director says don't plan ahead; go with an empty mind and trust something will happen. The perfect theatre should make you feel important. Going to the theatre is a special event, and the workers should act like it. It's bad if they seem like it's just a job. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well and feel close to the stage. The room size is important; it should fit human voices and bodies. If it's too big, it's wrong because drama is about people. Many old theatres were good because the room held the stage well. I like theatres that feel old, like worn steps in a church, with many people's memories. For plays, you can't please everyone. You can't guess what the audience wants because they don't know. When you go to the theatre, you want something surprising, or else you could have stayed home.","Actors often face criticism and disrespect. This is partly because actors, when asked by their companies, talk about their craft in interviews. They should respond like the dancer Pavlova, who said, 'If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it.' But instead, actors use heavy clichés, silly sayings, or get caught in gossip. We should pay attention to Paul Scofield's words in a letter: an actor's work only has life when performed; discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. There are no fixed rules, except perhaps being audible. With each play, actors start from nothing, learning anew and growing with the characters and writer's ideas. After the play ends, they feel empty until the next role, and this emptiness is clear in any talk about theatre. In a review of Hamlet, Adrian Lester's Hamlet is between boyhood and manhood, with a performance that is simple and confident. He handles the text well and shows great control, making him a top actor. He plays a tense, irritable young man with hidden anger, but he is also witty and humorous, making him strong and likable. His skill is clear, even if understated. Notice how his body hangs stiffly, as if waiting to be brought to life. Handy's Horatio gives a similar sense of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions: What is acting? Is it imitating behavior? Who animates these bodies? That's the central issue in theatre. One director uses a rehearsal method called 'dropping in'. Actors sit quietly while others speak, feeling the words' effects. When they speak, they look at the script on a screen, think about the meaning, wait for an impulse to speak, and then say their lines. For instance, for 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?', they breathe, let a thought drop in, like a memory or vision, imagine a scene such as waiting in line, and find the reason to speak. The director says not to plan or judge; go in with an empty mind and trust that something will happen. The perfect theatre should make audiences feel their presence matters. Attending a live performance is an event, and staff should recognize this. It's alienating if workers treat it as just a job. The theatre must build a connection between performers and audience, ensuring no one has a biased view. People should be close enough to see, hear, and feel connected to the stage. Auditorium proportions are crucial; they should suit the human voice and body. If the space dwarfs humans, it's flawed because drama centers on people. Many 19th-century theatres succeeded by designing auditoriums that embrace the stage. I prefer theatres with a sense of history, like worn church steps, showing layers of human presence. For plays, you can't cater to everyone because audiences don't know what they want. When you visit the theatre, you seek the unexpected; otherwise, staying home would be better.","Actors are sometimes subjected to derision and contempt, often because they are required by their film or theatre companies to discuss their craft in interviews. They would be better off emulating the dancer Pavlova, who replied to a question about her dancing with, 'If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it.' However, actors frequently resort to ponderous clichés, silly truisms, or get drawn into gossip. We ought to heed Paul Scofield's remarks in a letter: he found that an actor's work is vibrant only during its execution; in discussion, it becomes theoretical and insubstantial. There are no definitive rules, aside from perhaps audibility. With every new play and playwright, actors begin from scratch, as if knowing nothing, and proceed to learn afresh, developing through character relationships and the writer's insights. Once a play's run concludes, actors feel empty until the next project, and this void is evident in any theatre discussion. In a review of Hamlet, Adrian Lester's portrayal balances precariously between boyhood and manhood, delivering a performance of thrilling simplicity and assurance. His mastery of the text and his physical and psychological control elevate him to a frontline actor, one with the intelligent confidence to be nearly self-effacing. Lester depicts an edgy, tetchy young man fueled by suppressed anger; he is agile, watchful, and driven, employing acid wit and generous humor that render him both formidable and lovable. Although understated, the virtuosity is unmistakable. Observe Lester's body, with arms hanging stiffly, suggesting a figure awaiting animation. Similarly, Handy's Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force that is partly known and unknown. This prompts questions: What is acting? Is it an imitation or evocation of behavior? Who animates these bodies, morally and physically? That is the central question in theatre life. One director employs a rehearsal technique called 'dropping in'. Actors sit quietly while others speak, discerning the words' effects. When it's their turn, they glance at the script on a screen, digest the first phrase, contemplate its personal meaning, await the impulse to speak, and then deliver the line. For example, with the line 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?', they breathe, allow a thought to drop in—such as a memory, vision, or impression—visualize a scene like waiting in line, and find the pathway to the line. Impulses can arise externally or internally, such as from another actor's gaze or the character's situation. The director emphasizes not pre-planning or judging; instead, approach with an empty mind and trust that something will occur. The ideal theatre should make audiences feel that their presence makes a difference. Attending a live performance is an event, and staff should share this sense. It is alienating if front-of-house workers treat it as merely a job. The theatre must foster a relationship between performers and audience, ensuring no one has an unreasonably prejudiced view. Audiences should be sufficiently close to see, hear, and feel connected to the stage. Auditorium proportions are vital; they must accommodate the human voice and body scale. If an auditorium dwarfs the human form, it is flawed because drama inherently revolves around people. Many late 19th-century theatres achieved this by shaping auditoriums that embrace the stage. I appreciate theatres with a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, evoking layers of human presence. Regarding plays, it's impossible to please everyone, as audiences cannot be second-guessed about their desires. When visiting the theatre, one seeks something unimaginable; otherwise, it would be preferable to stay home.","Derision and contempt are occasionally directed at actors, much of it stemming from instances when actors are compelled by their film or theatre companies to articulate their craft in interviews. They would do well to adopt the response of the dancer Pavlova, who, when queried about the meaning of her dance, retorted, 'If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it.' Yet, all too often, they lapse into ponderous clichés, trivial truisms, or the prurient mechanisms of gossip. We should take note of Paul Scofield's assertion in a letter: he discovered that an actor's work possesses vitality and interest solely in its execution; it withers in discussion, becoming emptily theoretical and insubstantial. It adheres to no rules, with the possible exception of audibility. For every play and playwright, actors commence from scratch, as if devoid of prior knowledge, and proceed to learn anew, evolving through the relationships of characters and the insights of the writer. Upon the conclusion of a play's run, the actor is left empty until the next engagement, and this emptiness is palpable in any discourse on theatrical work. In a critique of Hamlet, Adrian Lester's interpretation is poised precariously between adolescence and adulthood, constituting a performance marked by thrilling simplicity and assurance. His adept handling of the text, combined with his physical and psychological self-control, propels him into the ranks of frontline actors—those endowed with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing. Lester portrays an edgy, tetchy youth who subsists on a banked-down sense of anger; he is agile, watchful, and driven, deploying a blend of acid wit and generous humor that renders him both formidable and endearing. Although underplayed, the virtuosity of his performance is unmistakable. Observe Lester's physique, the manner in which his arms hang stiffly, imparting a sense of a figure in anticipation of animation. Handy's depiction of Horatio similarly evokes a body animated by an inner force that is both familiar and enigmatic. Thus, fundamental questions arise: What constitutes acting? Is it an imitation or an evocation of behavior? Who, and what, animates these bodies in moral and physical terms? This constitutes the central inquiry regarding the life of the theatre. One director's approach to rehearsal involves a process termed 'dropping in'. Actors sit in silence while others deliver lines, ascertaining the impact of the words. When their turn arrives, they glance at the script projected on a screen, assimilate the initial phrase, reflect on its personal significance, await the impulse—the rationale for speech—and then articulate the line. For instance, with the line 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?', they inhale, permitting a thought to descend with their breath—be it a memory, vision, or impression. Some may conjure an image of a queue, perhaps at a bus stop en route to rehearsals or for a rock concert in their youth. After visualizing the scene, they identify the impulse to speak—what the director refers to as 'the pathway to the line'. Impulses may originate externally or internally; one might look into the eyes of a fellow actor or consider the character's circumstances. The director describes 'dropping in' as a method for uncovering what is transpiring, advising against pre-planning or pre-judging, and encouraging one to venture forth with an empty mind, trusting that something will transpire. The perfect theatre ought to instill in audiences a sense that their presence has made a difference. Attending the theatre, or any live performance, is an event, and the staff should embody this awareness. It is profoundly alienating if front-of-house personnel convey that it is merely a routine job. The theatre must cultivate a relationship between performer and audience, ensuring that no spectator feels they are receiving an unreasonably prejudiced perspective. It is imperative that audiences are not excessively distant; they must be able to hear, see, and feel some degree of contact with the onstage proceedings. The proportions of an auditorium are critical; they must resonate with the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium diminishes the human form, it is inherently flawed, for one cannot negate the human essence at the core of drama. Numerous theatres from the late nineteenth century excelled in this regard by fashioning auditoriums that somehow embrace the stage. I have a predilection for theatres that exude a sense of the past, akin to worn stone steps in a church, which convey strata of human presence. From the perspective of the plays themselves, it is unfeasible to cater to every individual; one cannot second-guess an audience, as they are unaware of their own desires.

This constitutes the central quandary pertaining to the life of the theatre. One director's methodology for rehearsal is encapsulated in the process known as 'dropping in'.

Certain individuals might envision a queue, perhaps at a bus stop during their commute to rehearsals or for a rock concert in their youth. Having visualized the scene, they ascertain the impulse to articulate it—what this director terms 'the pathway to the line'. Impulses can emanate from external or internal sources; one might gaze into the eyes of the listening actor or ponder the character's predicament. The director characterizes 'dropping in' as a means of uncovering the underlying dynamics, eschewing pre-planning or pre-judgement, and advocating for an approach with an empty mind, trusting that something will transpire. The ideal theatre should engender in the audience a conviction that their presence has effected a difference. Attending the theatre, or any live performance, is an event, and the personnel must share this perception. It is profoundly alienating if one senses that front-of-house staff regard it as merely any mundane occupation.

Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano?

Even a member of that mythical species, the completely tone deaf, could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Simply to see her zipping around a keyboard grabbing fistfuls of notes at the behest of some unfeasible contemporary score is to watch a pianist pushing the human frame to its limits.
But even her dazzling virtuosity was not enough to was one small boy at a recent concert she gave for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he had been cascaded with bits and bobs of pieces in every style from her vast repertoire of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African, etc. He'd coolly watched her dive under the lid of the concert grand to pluck the wires - normally a surefire knockout for kids. Then as she drew breath and invited questions, he piped up: 'Can you play Match of the Day?'
How many veterans of the concert hall platform would be floored by such a request? For Joanna MacGregor, though, it was simply a hoot. 'In his eyes, until I played that, I hadn't passed the test. I wasn't a proper pianist.' Needless to say, she sailed through and doubtless logged the experience for her next children's recital.
MacGregor is rare among top-flight concert pianists for the interest she takes in how young children learn the instrument. She has just published her own elementary piano tutor for children: Joanna MacGregor's Piano World. And she has managed it despite a crippling work schedule.
There hardly seems to be a festival this summer she is not gracing. Tomorrow she is in the thick of an all-day collaboration between nine young composers and artists. She runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. And by her own admission, she cannot meet an artist of any sort without being tempted to suggest a joint project. So why on earth take on the extra burden of writing a book?
'People who know me are clearly surprised. But I think the very first lessons are absolutely crucial. It says a lot about the music profession that we tend to concentrate on the top end, on this idea of the child as nascent virtuoso. Most people's interest in music is much more ordinary and everyday. I find that far more interesting!'
In producing the first three books, MacGregor is drawing on vivid experience. Between the ages of 18 and 25, before she was getting concert engagements as a pianist, she taught a stream of beginners the piano. But most important in her make-up now as a musician who is unsurpassed in the breadth of her eclectic repertoire was the endless procession of small boys and girls traipsing into her childhood home, where her mother taught the piano.
'Not only was I fiddling around at the keyboard, but there were all these other children of all backgrounds wanting to play every sort of music - bits of classical, jazz, pop, improvisation. I wasn't part of that hothouse thing of forcing exceptional talent. I grew up with the idea of trying to make music available to people of all abilities.'
Just as everyone should be able to learn how to swim or to speak a smattering of French, so, in her view, should everybody be able to make a stab at learning the piano. Some kids have a flair and make rapid progress. She is fascinated by the others: those who chug along at varying rates of progress, enjoying it for a while, but all too often giving up. This falling off happens at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too frustrating. Others rebel further down the line when the stakes get higher and parental pressure is driving them 'to be like those children on the telly.'
'I worry that some people use music, like sport, as a way of making their children achieve things, rather than just saying: it's music, it's there to enjoy. The reason children fall by the wayside is because they feel they are not going to match up to their parents' expectations.
The production of her own training manual begs an obvious question. Does she have a poor opinion of the existing corpus of tutor books, or indeed of the general quality of piano teaching? 'I'm very reluctant to criticise other people's teaching or others' tutor books,' she says. What she does do is readily accept that her books, colourful and eye-catching though they are, are by no means the only books on the market designed to make the first steps enjoyable.
Her own special wheeze for luring these neophytes, the fives, sixes and sevens, through those bewildering times is to weave a storyline into the books and their accompanying CDs. The challenge at this fragile stage is to make the work interesting. And so, from lesson one, there are accompaniments in a variety of styles for teacher - or parent - to play beneath a child's line. For kids whose parents aren't pianists the accompaniments are recorded on the CDs. Learning should be unadulterated fun, MacGregor insists.
'You have to allow them to improvise and give them a reason to play at either end of the keyboard and on the black notes and use the pedals.' As progress is made, bigger obstacles loom. Children need to be coaxed quite hard to read the music rather than rely on ear. Having relied for so much of her own childhood on her very keen ear, MacGregor has considerable sympathy on this score.
But she believes the single most important factor is practice. How can children be persuaded to play a passage even once again, let alone many times over? She admits to not having practised rigorously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she began building up a contemporary repertoire whose formidable difficulties demanded practice. Now she loves it. The eight hours a day that she gets through are the core of her musical life, she says, more important than performances.
'I have enormous sympathy with people who find it difficult. I don't think people talk about it enough.' The secret, whether you do it for twenty minutes or five hours, is to work out beforehand what it is you are aiming to do, she says. Other tips: treat yourself - play the whole piece through, however many wrong notes. And mix hard with easy.",C2,"Joanna MacGregor is a famous piano player. She plays concerts and is very busy.

317,"Heritage

The true meaning and significance of heritage is that it gives people and communities a genuine sense of connection with the past. Obviously, we feel connected to our personal heritage usually, we know who and what our grandparents were, and we will have heard stories about how they lived. But, beyond that, there is a wider basic need to learn about our past, in order to help us understand and interpret our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a fundamental desire for continuity - assurance about the past goes a long way to assuring our future. It is through this continuity that we achieve our own place in history, our own immortality.
In the same way that you inherit your genes, you also inherit a culture which has been passed down through many generations. There are aspects of your national heritage that you may not like or condone, but it is yours, and it is reassuring to feel a part of something.
Heritage has a phenomenal amount to teach us and, I would say, is imperative for our well-being. It affects everything from customs to material culture. Traditionally, our link with the past was through the stories and legends passed down by our ancestors. But, because Western industrial society broke up communities and families, much of that oral tradition has already been lost. Instead, places and architectural 'memories' give us clues to our past. It is vitally important to conserve and restore these links as a testament to our ancestors' identity.

The Fens

Some while ago I began a novel, Waterland, in which, though I did not know it then, the landscape of that part of England known as the Pens was to play a major part. Since the novel was published I have often been asked why, as an ignorant and perhaps presumptuous Londoner, I chose to write about a part of the country with which I have no personal connection. The short answer is that I chose the Fens because of their apparent unobtrusiveness -- a flat and empty stage on which to set the drama of my book. This, as I learnt, was merely theory. The Fens, once one's imagination has got to grips with them, are neither flat nor empty. What I discovered was that the Fens, while as richly English as any other part of England, are also compellingly and hauntingly strange. It is remarkable that there should still exist in the middle of England a region which most English people find peculiarly foreign, especially when so many other distinctive (and remoter) areas of Britain have been ingested into the nations cultural and literary heritage. The Fens are both empty and brimming, both cultivated and tenaciously wild, apparently 'open' and 'obvious' yet profoundly mysterious.
My own physical researches while writing my novel were in fact not so extensive. I have never been, yet, to Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a writer of fiction I am interested in imagined worlds, and I would much rather hazard an inspired guess at some point of authenticity than go for documentary proof. Yet this very attempt to 'imagine' the Fens has its special logic, for, as the pages of Edward Storey's scholarly book abundantly show, the Fens are, peculiarly, not just a landscape but a state of mind.

Museums

Museums must make their collections accessible. In the past, this simply meant packing them into display cases, often with wordy labels that made little concession to the lay person. Nowadays, accessibility should demand more than this. Displays can be lively and interesting, making the best use of theatrical or architectural techniques to capture visitors' attention and perhaps stimulate emotional response. But museums should be about more than their displays. They should make their collections accessible to the widest possible community. The provision of loan boxes of objects for class teachers is one known example of this and, recently, this principle has been extended by some museums so that similar material is made available for use in treating elderly people who are losing their memory.
Museums concern themselves with 'artefacts and specimens' - not replicas. They exist to facilitate an encounter with authenticity. They present items that actually existed - were used - had meaning - at some historical time. This is their great strength, and is what distinguishes them from heritage centres and theme parks, books and CD-ROMs. Museums which rise to the challenge which this distinction implies and provide exciting and accessible displays, catalogues and outreach programmes, will find that their apparent competitors in 'virtual history' are in fact their allies, stimulating an appetite for the 'real thing' that museums are uniquely placed to satisfy.

Architecture and Environment

The desire to preserve things is not new, but now change in our towns comes with such speed and on such a scale that most of us are affected by it in some way. It turns some people into rabid preservationists and it encourages others to think more closely about the nature of towns as we know them today and their future.
It may be quite reasonably argued that the generations who have lived through events such as world wars and the like are more inclined to preservation than their predecessors - anything which expresses stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation it is part of the planners job to take account of it.
Change is no enemy if we learn how to handle it. Physical change, in other words, change in the environment provided by our towns, reflects social change - change in our numbers, in our welfare and in our demands.",C2,"Heritage is about our past.

Museums show real things from the past. They should be fun and easy to understand. They help teachers and old people. We want to keep old buildings in towns. Change is fast, but we can manage it. It shows how society changes.","Heritage gives people a connection to the past. We feel linked to our personal history, like our grandparents' stories. We also need to learn about our national past to understand our future. Heritage provides continuity, making us feel secure. It is like inheriting culture from past generations. Even if we don't like some parts, it is still ours. Heritage teaches us and is vital for well-being. It includes customs and objects. Old stories are lost, so we rely on places and buildings to learn. We must conserve them. The Fens are a flat area in England. The author chose them for his novel because they seemed empty, but they are actually strange and full of life. They are English yet foreign. The writer imagined them without visiting. Museums should make collections accessible with interesting displays. They offer real objects, not copies, and help schools and elderly people. Museums are different from theme parks because they show authentic items. Preservation of buildings is common now due to fast change. People want stability, and planners should consider this. Change in towns reflects social changes, and we can handle it well.","Heritage provides a genuine sense of connection with the past for individuals and communities.

Beyond that, there is a basic need to learn about our past to interpret our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity, offering assurance about the future. It helps us find our place in history. Similar to inheriting genes, we inherit a culture passed down through generations.

He chose them for their unobtrusive, flat appearance, but discovered they are neither flat nor empty; they are richly English yet strangely compelling. It is remarkable that this area feels foreign to many English people. The Fens are both cultivated and wild, open yet mysterious. The author researched them through imagination rather than extensive visits, as they represent a state of mind. Museums must make collections accessible with lively displays that use theatrical techniques to engage visitors. They should reach the widest community, for example, by providing loan boxes for teachers and materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on authentic artefacts, not replicas, facilitating encounters with real historical items. This distinguishes them from heritage centres and theme parks, and museums that offer exciting displays can ally with virtual history to satisfy the desire for authenticity. The desire to preserve things is not new, but rapid change in towns affects many people, leading some to become preservationists. This may stem from a psychological need for stability after events like wars, and planners should account for it. Change in the environment reflects social change, and it is not an enemy if managed properly.","The true significance of heritage lies in its ability to furnish individuals and communities with an authentic connection to the past. Ordinarily, we feel linked to our personal heritage through awareness of our grandparents and narratives about their existence. Furthermore, there exists a broader fundamental necessity to comprehend our history to aid in interpreting our individual and collective futures. Heritage embodies a fundamental desire for continuity, where certainty about the past substantially assures our future. Through this continuity, we attain our own historical position and a form of immortality. Analogous to genetic inheritance, we inherit a culture transmitted across generations. Certain elements of national heritage might be disapproved of, yet they remain integral to our identity and offer a sense of belonging. Heritage is imperative for well-being, imparting lessons on customs and material culture. In Western industrial societies, the dissolution of communities has led to the loss of oral traditions, necessitating reliance on architectural memories for historical insight, and it is crucial to conserve these connections. The Fens, a region in England, featured prominently in the author's novel. Initially selected for their seemingly unobtrusive and flat nature as a setting, they proved to be neither flat nor empty upon deeper engagement. The Fens are quintessentially English yet hauntingly strange, remarkably perceived as foreign by many English people despite being centrally located. They are paradoxically empty and brimming, cultivated and tenaciously wild, ostensibly open yet profoundly mysterious. The author's physical research was limited, preferring imaginative exploration, which aligns with the Fens' nature as not merely a landscape but a state of mind. Museums are obligated to render their collections accessible, moving beyond static displays with verbose labels to employ dynamic, theatrical techniques that captivate and evoke emotional responses. They should extend accessibility to diverse communities, exemplified by loan boxes for educators and resources for elderly individuals experiencing memory loss. Museums specialize in authentic artefacts and specimens, enabling direct encounters with historical reality, which distinguishes them from heritage centres and theme parks. By embracing this distinction with innovative displays and outreach, museums can collaborate with virtual history platforms to cultivate an appetite for authenticity. The impetus to preserve is longstanding, but contemporary urban change occurs with such rapidity and scale that it impacts most people, fostering preservationist attitudes and prompting reflection on urban nature and futures. This preservation urge may derive from a psychological need for stability, particularly among generations that have endured upheavals like world wars, and urban planners must incorporate this consideration. Environmental change mirrors societal transformations in demographics, welfare, and demands, and when adeptly managed, change is not adversarial.","Heritage bestows upon individuals and communities a profound sense of connection with the past, serving as a conduit for understanding and interpreting both personal and national futures. Typically, we experience this connection through familiarity with our grandparents and the lore of their lives, yet a more extensive, fundamental need exists to delve into our history. Heritage epitomizes a desire for continuity, wherein assurance regarding the past significantly bolsters confidence in the future, thereby enabling us to secure our historical legacy and a semblance of immortality. In a manner akin to genetic inheritance, we receive a cultural legacy propagated across generations; while certain facets of national heritage may be unpalatable, they are inextricably part of our identity and provide existential reassurance. Heritage is indispensable for well-being, offering instructive insights into customs and material culture. The fragmentation of communities in Western industrial society has eroded oral traditions, compelling reliance on architectural mnemonic devices to decipher the past, and it is imperative to safeguard these linkages. The Fens, an English landscape, assumed a pivotal role in the author's novel, chosen for their ostensibly unobtrusive, planar character as a theatrical backdrop, though they revealed themselves to be neither flat nor vacant upon imaginative engagement. This region is remarkably English yet pervaded by a compelling and eerie strangeness, standing as an anomaly within England that many perceive as peculiarly foreign, despite the assimilation of other distinctive areas into the cultural and literary canon. The Fens embody contradictions: they are both barren and replete, both tamed and resiliently wild, superficially transparent yet deeply enigmatic. The author's empirical investigations were circumscribed, eschewing documentary verification in favor of imaginative conjecture, a approach justified by the Fens' unique quality as not solely a physical terrain but a psychological state. Museums must ensure the accessibility of their collections, transcending antiquated practices of dense labeling by employing vibrant, architecturally and theatrically inspired displays that engage visitors and provoke emotional resonance. Beyond exhibitions, museums should democratize access to their holdings for the broadest community, illustrated by initiatives such as loan boxes for educators and analogous materials for therapeutic use with memory-impaired elderly individuals. Museums are defined by their commitment to artefacts and specimens—authentic items that existed and held meaning in historical contexts—which facilitates genuine encounters and differentiates them from heritage centres, theme parks, and digital media. Institutions that adeptly navigate this distinction with compelling displays and outreach programs will find that virtual history platforms act as allies, stimulating a craving for authenticity that museums are uniquely positioned to fulfill. The propensity for preservation, though not novel, is accentuated by the rapid, large-scale transformations in urban environments, which affect most individuals and incite both fervent preservationism and contemplative analysis of contemporary towns and their trajectories. This preservationist impulse may be psychologically rooted in a quest for stability, particularly among cohorts that have witnessed cataclysmic events like global conflicts, and it falls to planners to integrate this dimension. Environmental alterations in towns reflect societal shifts in population, welfare, and exigencies, and change, when adeptly managed, is not inimical but rather a manifestation of evolution.","Heritage

I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object.

I squinted info the morning sun looking out at the Arizona mountains and I had to admit, I was not at home on the range,
Flying in from Denver just after dawn, I had the feeling that I just might pass far an ol' cowhand coming in from the sky. The feeling didn't last past the first real cowboy in the luggage hall of Phoenix airport.

I flatout loved being a racing driver, driving racing cars. I am addicted to it and it is all I know how to do. But I don't do it any more. I couldn't if I wanted to. Question is, I thought, looking into the mean, rust-coloured rock of the mountains in the distance, what do I do now?
A racing driver should have one or two fall-back identities lined up for when he climbs out of his car. I thought I did, but when I reached for them they just disappeared. How about: an ex-racing driver adds colour to the commentary direct from the trackside? 'We got fifteen guys, all of them former Indy and Formula One drivers, fifteen guys in front of you, Forrest, standing in line to be colour commentators. We'll call you.'
Well then, how about: an ex-racing driver coins a partnership to sell classic cars? That lasted nearly all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers und meetings with bankers. But it was the year nobody was buying old Ferraris and Honda was 'reviewing' its dealer list. So in the end I gracefully withdrew before there was nothing to withdraw from. Being an 'ex' anything is depressing work. I mean you tell me, how badly do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. And even if I had been world champion you could probably just about stand to listen to the story for five minutes before your ears turned to cement. Last year's champion was last year.
Not that I want sympathy. Which is just as well, since I don't get any. Well, why should I? I had a good run, made money and hung on to enough. But oh, man, I miss the heat of slipping into that graceful, elegant, shrink-wrapped super-tech machine with seven hundred horsepower behind my neck. Zero to a hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4,9 seconds. And yes, I miss coming within an eyelash of killing myself every race or so. I miss the bright and gorgeous people and the reporters who acted as if what I said mattered. Being famous, even in a minor way, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians bragged to their friends that they knew me. Little boys slid under fences to get my autograph. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Only last week the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and I have time in the afternoon. And let me just check, but I think tomorrow is free, so much empty time.
I looked up into the soft blue morning sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little brown birds in a saguaro cactus just in front of me were giving me advice, something like 'get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out'.

It did occur to me that a bogus cowboy in designer boots had a lot to learn.",C2,I am wearing very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I am not a cowboy. I feel sad. I was a racing driver. I loved driving fast cars. Now I do not drive. I do not know what to do. I miss my old life. I have a lot of free time now.,"I am in the Arizona desert wearing expensive cowboy boots. I am not a cowboy, and I feel out of place. I used to be a racing driver and loved it. Now I do not drive anymore. I tried other jobs, but they did not work. I miss driving fast cars and being famous. I have too much free time now and feel lost.","I stood in the Arizona desert wearing my expensive designer cowboy boots. I was dressed like a cowboy, but I was not one, and I felt uncomfortable. I used to be a racing driver and was addicted to the thrill of driving fast cars. Now that I have stopped, I have tried to find new roles, like being a commentator or selling classic cars, but nothing succeeded. I miss the excitement, the people, and the fame. With so much free time, I feel uncertain about my future.","I found myself in the Arizona desert, clad in costly designer cowboy boots, attempting to embody a cowboy but failing miserably. As a former racing driver, I deeply miss the adrenaline of high-speed competition and the recognition it brought. Despite exploring alternatives such as commentary or business ventures, none have panned out, leaving me adrift. The transition from a celebrated career to obscurity has been challenging, and I now grapple with an abundance of idle time and a sense of purposelessness.","Positioned on the ancient rock formations of the Arizona desert, I stood in exorbitantly priced designer cowboy boots, fully attired in cowboy gear yet acutely aware of my inadequacy in that role. My past as a racing driver, a profession I was profoundly passionate about, now haunts me; the cessation of that career has left a void I struggle to fill. Endeavors such as becoming a trackside commentator or engaging in classic car sales proved futile, reinforcing my sense of displacement. I yearn for the intensity of racing, the camaraderie of illustrious circles, and the validation of public acclaim, all of which have evaporated, leaving me with a surplus of time and a dearth of direction.","We are Talking Big Boots here. Really BIGTIME Boots.
I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working. I squinted info the morning sun looking out at the Arizona mountains and I had to admit, I was not at home on the range,
Flying in from Denver just after dawn, I had the feeling that I just might pass far an ol' cowhand coming in from the sky. The feeling didn't last past the first real cowboy in the luggage hall of Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweat-stained I-shirt, needed a shave, and was hoisting a dirty canvas bag off the conveyer belt when he caught sight of my brand new cowboy boots. He slowly raised one eyebrow and moved off out of the door without looking back.
There ought to be, somewhere, hanging in a closet, a suit of clothes an ex-racing driver can put on without feeling like he is from another planet. Something he could wear so that wherever he goes he doesn't get the feeling that everybody is talking another language and doing whatever they do at half speed. I liked, no, not liked... I flatout loved being a racing driver, driving racing cars. I am addicted to it and it is all I know how to do. But I don't do it any more. I couldn't if I wanted to.

319,"Photography

When a photographer takes a photograph, he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, together with a set of social and cultural norms. And in the course of this book we shall see how these factors not only affect the style, content and expression of a photograph, but also how those images are perceived and responded to by the viewer. For example, we might consider that the casual reader of a newspaper will have an implicit understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the page. But rather than accepting the photograph at face value, we might question whether it accurately recorded the scene as it would have looked at the time. Or, in contrast, does it communicate the photographer's point of view? Is it the precise instant recorded that is of particular importance, or should the photograph on the page be understood as a symbol to represent a state of affairs in the world?

More than a game

Sport for me has always been more than just a game. The most successful people in sport have total self-belief. You need tunnel vision if you want to succeed in sport. There's only one route to being the best and you have to put everything else to one side. Sport is ruthless and no one else is going to do it for you. It's sink or swim.
Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it can also teach you the benefits of working as one of a team. My sport allows and encourages you to excel individually, yet it is a team game and you have to balance these two aspects. It's very much like life - you can succeed as an individual, but you must never forget there are others around you.
Sport has given me a great deal - and not just financially. It has opened doors for me and opened my eyes, and I've seen things around the world that others will never see. But you also have to give up a lot for those perks.

Tuning in

Some experiences etch themselves so sharply on our memory that they form islands of clarity in our recollection. For me, such a momentous occasion took place one night in California many years ago, when I lay awake listening to the rapturous strains of a mockingbird singing from an invisible location in one of the tall trees that were dotted around the suburban neighbourhood. I don't suffer from insomnia - it was the exquisite artistry of the singer that kept me awake. As I followed his intricately woven melodies, I found myself drawn into an unexpected aesthetic environment. In order to follow the patterns that issued from the bird, I had to call on my experience of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird had me convinced that I was being treated to an ad lib performance of the most breathtaking improvisational acrobatics. I groaned and I cheered as one improbable musical variation followed another through the open window where I lay listening, until finally I fell asleep.",C2,"Photography: When a person takes a photo, they choose what to show. This depends on their skills, ideas, and what society thinks. In this book, we will see how this changes the photo and how people see it. For example, when you look at a photo in a newspaper, you might think it shows the truth. But we can ask: Is it real? Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is it important because of the moment, or does it mean something bigger? Sport: For me, sport is not just a game. The best players believe in themselves a lot. To be the best, you must focus only on sport and forget other things. Sport is hard, and no one helps you. You must try hard or fail. Sport teaches me to be disciplined and to work with a team. In my sport, you can be good alone, but it is a team game. You need to do both. It is like life: you can succeed alone, but remember others. Sport has given me many things, not just money. It has let me see the world. But I had to give up a lot for this. Tuning in: Some memories are very clear. For me, one night in California, I was awake and heard a bird singing beautifully in a tree. I was not sick; the bird's song kept me awake. The music was like jazz or Indian music. I felt like the bird was making up the music just for me. I made sounds and listened until I fell asleep.","Photography: When a photographer takes a picture, they select visual information based on their technical and artistic skills, personal views, and social norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style and meaning of a photograph and how viewers understand it. For instance, a newspaper reader might think a photo shows reality, but we can question if it truly captures the scene or expresses the photographer's perspective. Is the exact moment key, or does the photo symbolize a larger situation? Sport: Sport has always been more than a game to me. Top athletes have strong self-confidence. To succeed, you need intense focus and must set aside everything else. Sport is competitive, and you must rely on yourself. It teaches personal discipline and the value of teamwork. In my sport, you can excel individually, but it's also a team activity, requiring a balance. This is similar to life: you can achieve as an individual, but should not ignore others. Sport has provided me with many benefits beyond money, like opportunities to travel and learn, though it demands sacrifices. Tuning in: Certain experiences create vivid memories. One night in California, I lay awake listening to a mockingbird sing wonderfully from a tree. I don't have insomnia; the bird's artistic singing kept me awake. As I followed its complex melodies, I entered a unique aesthetic space. Drawing on my knowledge of jazz and Indian music, I felt the bird was improvising an amazing performance. I reacted with sounds of enjoyment until I eventually fell asleep.","Photography: When a photographer captures an image, they make choices about visual content that are shaped by their technical and aesthetic abilities, personal beliefs, and cultural context. This book will examine how these elements affect both the photograph's style and content and how audiences interpret it. For example, a casual newspaper reader may assume that photos depict reality, but we should consider whether the image accurately represents the event or conveys the photographer's viewpoint. Is the specific moment captured crucial, or does the photograph serve as a symbol for broader issues? Sport: For me, sport transcends being merely a game. The most accomplished athletes possess unwavering self-belief. Achieving success requires singular focus and the willingness to prioritize sport above all else. Sport is unforgiving, and individuals must take responsibility for their own progress. It has instilled in me discipline and determination, while also highlighting the advantages of teamwork. In my sport, there is room for individual excellence within a team framework, necessitating a balance between the two. This mirrors life, where personal success can coexist with awareness of others. Sport has enriched my life in numerous ways, including financial gains, and has broadened my horizons through global experiences, though these perks come with significant sacrifices. Tuning in: Some experiences leave such a profound impression that they stand out clearly in memory. One night in California, I was kept awake by the enchanting song of a mockingbird hidden in a tree. I do not suffer from insomnia; it was the bird's masterful artistry that captivated me. As I traced its intricate melodies, I found myself immersed in an unexpected aesthetic realm. Using my familiarity with jazz and Indian classical music, I perceived the bird's performance as a spontaneous and breathtaking improvisation. I expressed my amazement audibly until I finally drifted off to sleep.","Photography: In the act of taking a photograph, a photographer selects visual information influenced by their technical proficiency, aesthetic sensibilities, personal perspectives, and societal conventions. This book will delve into how these factors not only dictate the style, content, and expression of the image but also shape its reception and interpretation by viewers. For instance, while a casual newspaper reader might implicitly accept photographic images as factual, we ought to interrogate whether they faithfully document the scene or instead communicate the photographer's subjective stance. Is the significance rooted in the precise instant captured, or should the photograph be regarded as a symbolic representation of wider circumstances? Sport: Sport has always represented more than just a game to me. The most successful individuals in sport exhibit absolute self-confidence. Attaining excellence demands tunnel vision and the capacity to disregard extraneous matters. Sport is inherently ruthless, necessitating self-reliance. It has taught me personal discipline and resolve, in addition to the benefits of collaborative effort. My sport permits and encourages individual achievement, yet it remains a team endeavor, requiring a equilibrium between these dual aspects. This parallels life, where one can prosper individually while remaining cognizant of the surrounding community. Sport has conferred substantial rewards upon me, extending beyond financial gains to include unique opportunities and global insights, albeit at the cost of considerable personal sacrifices. Tuning in: Certain experiences imprint themselves so vividly upon our memory that they form distinct islands of clarity. One such momentous occasion occurred during a night in California, when I lay awake, captivated by the rapturous song of a mockingbird emanating from an unseen perch in a tall tree. I do not experience insomnia; rather, it was the exquisite artistry of the bird's singing that prevented sleep. As I followed its intricately woven melodies, I was drawn into an unforeseen aesthetic environment. Drawing upon my experience with jazz and Indian classical music, I became convinced that I was witnessing an ad lib performance of stunning improvisational skill. I vocalized my reactions—groaning and cheering—as one improbable musical variation succeeded another, until I eventually succumbed to sleep.","Photography: When a photographer captures an image, they engage in a selection of visual information that is contingent upon their technical and aesthetic capabilities, personal viewpoints and experiences, as well as prevailing social and cultural norms. Throughout this book, we shall explore how these determinants not only influence the style, content, and expressive quality of a photograph but also mediate its perception and the responses it elicits from viewers. For example, we might posit that the casual peruser of a newspaper possesses an implicit comprehension of the reproduced photographic images, yet rather than accepting them at face value, we might scrutinize whether they accurately chronicle the scene as it existed or, conversely, articulate the photographer's perspective. Is it the exact instant recorded that holds particular import, or ought the photograph be interpreted as a symbol encapsulating a state of affairs in the world? Sport: For me, sport has perpetually constituted more than merely a game. The most triumphant figures in sport demonstrate total self-belief. Achieving preeminence necessitates tunnel vision and the relegation of all ancillary concerns. Sport is inherently ruthless, and no external agency will effectuate one's success. It has inculcated in me personal discipline and determination, while also elucidating the advantages of functioning within a team. My sport facilitates and promotes individual excellence, yet it is fundamentally a team game, obliging a harmonization of these two dimensions. It bears a strong resemblance to life—one can flourish as an individual, yet must invariably acknowledge the presence of others. Sport has bestowed upon me a great deal, transcending mere financial remuneration; it has unlocked doors and expanded my horizons, affording me global vistas inaccessible to many, though these privileges entail substantial relinquishments.

320,"Holiday reading

Summer promises us two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match. What was shy and confused within us is unapologetically and cogently phrased in them, a congruence all the more striking if the work was written by someone in a far-flung place or in another age. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. 

Author's Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then 'ecotourism' would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets. Then the thought that these pages were not a guidebook persuaded me that it didn't matter very much, so I let the story tell itself free of debilitating caveats.",C2,"Summer is a time for two great things: going away from home and reading books. These two things are connected. Books help us feel at home in the world. We see our own lives in books from long ago or far away. Writers use words to say what we feel but cannot say well. This makes us happy. Reading and travel help us see new things. When we go to a new place or read a great book, we notice more. We see the sky, faces, and feelings we did not see before. The author wrote these travel stories for a newspaper. He fixed small mistakes but did not change much. He could not know the future, like when money values changed. He was just a visitor trying to understand. Many people travel now because they can buy a ticket. Ecotourism is a word for holidays that help nature. But now it is used for many types of trips, like seeing tribes or wildlife. It started with good ideas, but there are no clear rules, so it is confusing. The author lost his notes from Transylvania for 50 years. He found them later. They helped him write about that time, but not perfectly. He stayed in many nice houses and did not write much. He thought he had nothing to write when he stopped. Later, he wrote the story without worrying about small details.","Summer brings two wonderful joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are closely linked. Books can make us feel more comfortable in the world. We connect our experiences to stories in books from other times or places because people are similar. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors describe situations we thought were unique to us, often with clear and accurate words. What we felt shy or confused about is expressed boldly in books, which is surprising if the writer lived far away or long ago. We thank these writers for reminding us of ourselves. Through reading and travel, we avoid getting bored by routine. Our eyes are most open in new places or when reading a great book, which shows us interesting things we missed. Our mind notices details like the sky's color, changes in a face, or hidden sadness. The author published these travel thoughts in a newspaper over seven years. He fixed small edits and errors but added little. He could not predict future events, like changes in money value, as he was just a visitor learning about the place. Mass travel lets people explore the world with only a ticket price, and he believes not all travelers are blind to their experiences. Ecotourism is a term that has been overused. It started in the 1980s with environmental awareness and travelers wanting to avoid harm. Now, it includes many trips, such as living with tribes or seeing nature, but without clear rules, it confuses travelers. The author's notebook from Transylvania was lost for 50 years and found by luck. It helped him write about that time, but he did not rely on it fully. He stayed in hospitable houses for weeks and often stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. When he wrote his book, he avoided too many warnings and let the story flow.","Summer offers two of life's great pleasures: escaping from home and reading books, which are deeply connected. Books help us feel more at ease in the wider world. We relate our personal experiences to those in books from different eras or locations because human types are fewer than individuals. In the works of others, we discover our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can articulate situations we felt alone in, or express our ideas with a clarity and psychological precision we might lack. Our inner confusion is confidently and logically phrased in these books, a match that is striking if the author lived in a distant place or time. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of our identity. Reading and travel help us break free from the dulling effects of habit. We are most observant in new environments or when reading a significant book, which highlights interests we previously overlooked. Our mind acts like a radar, tuned to detect certain elements in our awareness, such as sky variations, facial expressions, or underlying emotions. The author's travel reflections were originally newspaper articles over seven years. He restored minor editorial cuts and corrected errors but made few additions. He could not foresee future developments, like currency fluctuations, as he was merely a visitor focused on understanding current events. Mass air travel has opened the world to people with no special qualifications beyond affording a ticket, yet he doubts all travelers were completely unaware. Ecotourism is a phrase that has been misappropriated and diluted. It emerged in the early 1980s, driven by environmental concerns and travelers' desires to minimize negative impacts. Now, it encompasses a wide range of activities, from cultural exchanges to nature tours, but the absence of regulations leaves many travelers confused in an ecotourism jungle. The author's Transylvanian notebook was lost for five decades and rediscovered by chance. It aided in reconstructing that period for publication, though it was not a perfect support. He enjoyed a easier time than planned, staying in welcoming country houses and often pausing his writing during halts, mistakenly believing he had nothing to document. When composing the book, he initially included many cautions but later allowed the narrative to proceed without restrictive caveats.","Summer promises two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books—joys that are intimately connected. Books may assist us in feeling more at home in the world at large, as we relate our experiences to those depicted in literature from bygone eras or distant lands, owing to the fact that human types are fewer than individuals. In the books of others, we encounter our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can find words to describe situations we believed were uniquely ours or express our very thoughts with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not achieve. What was timid and muddled within us is unapologetically and cogently articulated in these works, a congruence that is particularly striking if the author resided in a far-flung location or another epoch. We feel appreciative towards these strangers for reminding us of our essence. Through reading and travel, we evade the deadening influence of habit. Our perception is never more acute than during initial days in a novel setting or while perusing a great book, which directs our attention to previously ignored interests.

Hindsight could have enabled further refinements, but that process would be endless; for instance, he could not predict the Hong Kong dollar's decline, as he was an ignorant visitor occupied with comprehending immediate events.

Ecotourism is a term that has been hijacked, diluted, and misused, earning top prize for such phrases. It originated in the early 1980s, reflecting heightened environmental awareness and tour operators' recognition of travelers' desires to avoid negative impacts. Nowadays, the ecotourism label broadly covers activities from immersive cultural tours to brief nature excursions, but the lack of regulations and a standard definition leaves travelers bewildered in an ecotourism jungle. The notebook from the Transylvanian segment of his journey was lost for fifty years and fortuitously recovered. It proved helpful in reconstructing that era for print, though not an infallible aid, as he experienced a more leisurely time than anticipated, lingering in hospitable residences and often ceasing writing during pauses, erroneously assuming nothing warranted recording. When drafting the book, he initially enveloped passages with provisos but ultimately permitted the story to unfold free of debilitating caveats.","Summer promises us two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books—joys that are, of course, intimately connected.

Author's Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then 'ecotourism' would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets.

321,"Family Business

'Look here, it's no good!' said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice in tow, had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, in the course of which I was presented with the Latin prize and the prize for the girl who had done best in her end-of-school exams. He had had a long conversation with my headteacher, and now here we were bound for home and holidays.
'What isn't?' I said, though I had guessed the trend of his thoughts from my father's unusual silence. He was a talkative man as a rule. 'You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,' he said. 'What with all those certificates. I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.'
'So?' I said, brazening it out. 'Mightn't that be useful?'
'I am also given to understand,' he went on, and then I knew the confrontation was coming, 'that you have ambitions to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!' My father knew quite a lot about barristers and the law.
'I just said that,' I said. 'I couldn't think of anything else to say!'
'And apparently,' he went on, 'you have the right sort of personality - you can pick the bones out of a mass of material pretty quickly, you have the gift of the gab and you enjoy performing.'
'I don't know about that,' I said. 'All I know is what I see in television dramas.'
'Be that as it may,' he went on, pulling himself together, 'I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that I can't see you fancying it.'
The trouble was that, like most children of hereditary trades, I did feel confined by the family expectations. I could see there were various professions open to me, and I wanted to explore the possibilities. At the same time, like a coward, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as frightened of him as Maurice was - I was the favourite - but I found him formidable.
'It's too soon to know,' I said feebly.
'I tell you you're not going to want to join us,' said my father, who had an annoying way of usually being right in such prophecies, 'and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.'
'There's still Maurice,' I said, sullen. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business. 'Anyway,' I went on, 'you could always use me as a sort of consultant.'
It was not as if my mother was around to lend a hand - she had died early in my childhood and my father had brought me and Maurice up. Maurice was two years younger than I was, and because he was motherless, early in our lives I got into the habit of taking care of him. It was not a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was so successful we lived in a good deal of luxury - in a big house in London, posh schools for both of us, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house buzzed with good talk and interesting encounters.
'I tell you what,' my father continued our conversation. 'You can go on helping us out in holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us you can. It will give you a bit of pocket money, and be a real help to me.'
'OK,' I said, relieved to be spared immediate choices and decisions, and especially the bout of depression and sulks my father would sink into if I opposed him. This was the way he controlled us. So it happened. In my last term at school, and then on vacations from university, I lent a hand, never more than about twice a year, and always on the safer assignments. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I intended to wear when I took my final exams.
It was in my last term that my father came up to see me and drove me out to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks to go. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I kept my head and spent these last precious days carefully arranging information in my mind, he might well be right. I felt poised, confident, concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me to do one last assignment for him, that it was the most important piece of business the family firm had ever attempted, and that he would see that it was more than worth my while. 
'But Dad,' I protested, 'I've got my final exams coming up, and I just need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well and I don't want to have to think about anything else just now.'
I could tell that such pressures were simply beyond my father's imagination (or was it that he was somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would interpret a refusal from me as a heartless betrayal in his hour of need.
That was not all. As he described the procedures I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father -- the clarity and resourcefulness with which he set about his life's work, the dynamic energy, the perfect self-control of the man. In his way he was a sort of genius, and I bowed to that in him. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.
'All right,' I said. 'I'll do it.'",C2,"My dad and I were in the car. He picked me up from my school. I won prizes at school. My dad said I will go to Oxford University. He said I want to be a lawyer. I said maybe. He said I will not work in the family business. I felt sad. I did not want to make him angry. I said I will help in holidays. I helped a little. Later, my dad asked me to do one more job before my exams. I said yes.","My dad and I were driving home from my school. I had won prizes for Latin and exams. My dad told me I would get a scholarship to Oxford. He said I wanted to be a barrister. I was not sure. He thought I would not join the family business. I felt limited by family expectations. I agreed to help during holidays. I helped a few times. Near my final exams, my dad asked me to do an important job for the business. I was worried about my exams, but I said I would do it.","My father collected me from my expensive girls' school after Parents' Day, where I received prizes. In the car, he said I would get a scholarship to Oxford and that I had ambitions to be a barrister. He believed I would not want to join the family business. I felt confined by family expectations but did not want to upset him. We agreed I would help during holidays. I assisted occasionally with safe tasks. Later, before my final exams, my father asked me to do a crucial assignment for the business. Although I was focused on my studies, I agreed because I admired his dedication.","After Parents' Day at my prestigious school, where I was awarded the Latin prize and top exam honors, my father drove me home. He informed me that I would receive a scholarship to Oxford and had expressed ambitions to become a barrister. He predicted I would not join the family business, which made me feel constrained, yet I avoided confrontation. I consented to assist during holidays, handling only safer assignments. In my final university term, my father requested I undertake a highly important task for the firm. Despite my need to concentrate on exams, I acquiesced, recognizing his resourcefulness and feeling my own plans diminished in comparison.","Following Parents' Day at the exclusive girls' school I attended, during which I was presented with the Latin prize and recognized as the top academic performer, my father collected me and my trunk. En route to London, he asserted that I would secure a scholarship to Oxford and harbored aspirations to become a barrister, deducing that my heart would not be in the family enterprise. I felt confined by hereditary expectations but, reluctant to provoke his displeasure, agreed to periodic holiday assistance. In my ultimate term at university, with my tutor forecasting a First in Law, my father implored me to execute a pivotal assignment for the business. Though preoccupied with examinations, I conceded, compelled by his formidable determination and the perceived insignificance of my own ambitions.","Family Business

322,"There are some activities that just will not be rushed. They take the time they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter.
The mind, too, works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can he speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot he rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line. 'Think fast; we need the results' may sometimes be as absurd a notion, or at least as counterproductive, as the attempt to cram a night's rest into half the time. We learn, think and know in a variety of ways, and these modes of the mind operate at different speeds, and are good for different mental jobs. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. And both are true.
Roughly speaking, the mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations demand an unselfconscious, instantaneous reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London some years ago, my brain and my body immediately choreographed for me an intricate and effective set of movements that enabled me to keep my seat - and it was only after the action was all over that my conscious mind and my emotions started to catch up. Neither a concert pianist nor an Olympic fencer has time to figure out what to do next. There is a kind of 'intelligence' that works more rapidly than thinking. This mode of fast physical intelligence could be called our 'wits'. (The five senses were originally known as 'the five wits'.)
Then there is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. A mechanic working out why an engine will not fire, a scientist trying to interpret an intriguing experimental result, a student wrestling with an assignment: all are employing a way of knowing that relies on reason and logic, on deliberate conscious thinking. We often call this kind of intelligence 'intellect'. Someone who is good at solving these sorts of problems we call 'bright' or 'clever'. But below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative. Perched on a seaside rock, lost in the sound and the motion of the surf, or hovering just on the brink of sleep or waking, we are in a different mental mode from the one we find ourselves in as we plan a meal or dictate a letter. This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury. We need the tortoise mind just as much as we need the hare brain.
Some kinds of everyday predicament are better, more effectively approached with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be penetrated with a relaxed, unquesting mental attitude. Recent scientific study shows convincingly that the more patient, less deliberate modes of mind are particularly suited to making sense of situations that are intricate, shadowy or ill defined. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is easily conceptualised. When we are trying to decide where to spend our holidays, it may well be perfectly obvious what the parameters are. But when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose - or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought - we need recourse to the tortoise mind. If the problem is how best to manage a difficult group of people at work, or whether to give up being a manager completely and retrain as a teacher, we may be better advised to sit and ponder than to search frantically for explanations and solutions. This type of intelligence is associated with what we call creativity, or even 'wisdom'.
Poets have always known the limitations of conscious, deliberate thinking, and have sought to cultivate these slower, mistier ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the realms of the mind that lie beyond and beneath the conscious intellect. It is only recently, however, that scientists have started to explore directly the slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The hybrid discipline of 'cognitive science' is revealing that the unconscious realms of the human mind will successfully accomplish a number of unusual, interesting and important tasks if they are given the time. They will learn patterns of a degree of subtlety which normal consciousness cannot even see, make sense out of situations that are too complex to analyse, and get to the bottom of certain difficult issues much more successfully than the questing intellect.

",C2,"Some things take time. You cannot make them go fast. For example, if you make mayonnaise and add oil too quickly, it will not be good. If you pull a tangled fishing line, it gets worse. Your mind also works at different speeds. Some thoughts are fast, like solving a puzzle. Some thoughts are slow, like thinking about a big problem. Both fast and slow thinking are important. Fast thinking helps in emergencies, like when you fall. Slow thinking helps with hard problems, like what job to choose. Poets and scientists know that slow thinking is good for creativity.","Some activities cannot be rushed; they need their own time. If you hurry mayonnaise, it curdles. If you pull a tangled fishing line, the knot tightens. Similarly, the mind works at various speeds. Fast thinking helps with quick reactions, such as avoiding a fall. Slow thinking is for difficult decisions, like changing careers. There are three speeds of mind: very fast for instant actions, medium for reasoning, and slow for deep thought. Slow thinking is not lazy; it is smart for complex issues. Scientists now study this and find that slow minds can solve tricky problems better than fast ones. Both fast and slow thinking are necessary.","Certain activities cannot be accelerated; they require the necessary time. For instance, rushing mayonnaise causes it to curdle, and impatiently pulling a tangled fishing line only tightens the knot. The mind operates at different paces: some processes are rapid, like reflexive actions, while others are slow, such as contemplation. Essentially, the mind has three speeds: the fastest for immediate physical responses, a medium speed for logical reasoning, and the slowest for reflective thought. Slow thinking is particularly effective for intricate or ambiguous situations, fostering creativity and wisdom. Research in cognitive science supports that unconscious, patient thought can resolve complex issues that deliberate analysis cannot. Thus, both rapid and gradual mental processes are vital.","Some endeavors inherently resist haste; they demand their own duration. Hastening mayonnaise preparation leads to curdling, and tugging impatiently on a tangled fishing line exacerbates the knot. Similarly, the mind functions across a spectrum of velocities: from instantaneous reactions to prolonged contemplation. Broadly, mental processing occurs at three tiers: ultra-rapid for unconscious reflexes, a deliberative pace for analytical reasoning, and a leisurely tempo for ruminative thought. This slower cognitive mode excels in navigating complex, ill-defined scenarios, enhancing creativity and insight. Cognitive science affirms that the unconscious mind, given time, can decipher subtle patterns and resolve intricate dilemmas more effectively than conscious intellect. Consequently, embracing both swift and measured thinking is essential for comprehensive mental capability.","Certain pursuits are impervious to acceleration; they necessitate their intrinsic temporal allocation. Expediting the emulsification of mayonnaise induces curdling, while impatient manipulation of an entangled fishing line only consolidates the knot. Analogously, the mind operates across a continuum of celerities: some functions are executed with alacrity, whereas others unfold over extended periods. The mind essentially encompasses three processing velocities: the pre-conscious for immediate somatic responses, the conscious for reasoned analysis, and the sub-conscious for contemplative assimilation. This gradual cognitive modality is particularly adept at elucidating nebulous and multifaceted circumstances, cultivating creativity and sagacity. Empirical investigations in cognitive science corroborate that the unconscious faculties, afforded sufficient time, can assimilate subtle patterns and surmount convoluted challenges more efficaciously than deliberate intellect. Thus, the integration of both expeditious and deliberate mental processes is indispensable for cognitive versatility.","There are some activities that just will not be rushed. They take the time they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles.

Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is easily conceptualised. When we are trying to decide where to spend our holidays, it may well be perfectly obvious what the parameters are. But when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose - or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought - we need recourse to the tortoise mind. If the problem is how best to manage a difficult group of people at work, or whether to give up being a manager completely and retrain as a teacher, we may be better advised to sit and ponder than to search frantically for explanations and solutions. This type of intelligence is associated with what we call creativity, or even 'wisdom'.
Poets have always known the limitations of conscious, deliberate thinking, and have sought to cultivate these slower, mistier ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the realms of the mind that lie beyond and beneath the conscious intellect. It is only recently, however, that scientists have started to explore directly the slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The hybrid discipline of 'cognitive science' is revealing that the unconscious realms of the human mind will successfully accomplish a number of unusual, interesting and important tasks if they are given the time. They will learn patterns of a degree of subtlety which normal consciousness cannot even see, make sense out of situations that are too complex to analyse, and get to the bottom of certain difficult issues much more successfully than the questing intellect.

323,"England's breakfast revolution 

The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. Admittedly, there are scattered references to travellers having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys, and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs or nobles. 
However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast, as individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours. Often this involved starting work extremely early. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone. ",C2,"Health experts say breakfast is very important. In the past, in England, most people did not eat breakfast. Only kings, nobles, or sick people ate it. But in the 1500s, breakfast became normal for everyone. This happened because more food was available and people started work very early. So, they needed to eat in the morning.","Health experts agree that a good breakfast is important. Historically, in England, breakfast was not common. It was mostly for travellers, the sick, or rich people like kings and nobles. In the 16th century, breakfast became usual for most people. This change was due to more food being available and new work habits. People began work early, so eating breakfast became necessary.","According to health experts, the importance of a good breakfast is clear. However, in England's history, breakfast was a relatively new practice and rarely mentioned in medieval times. It was mainly for travellers, the ill, or the wealthy such as monarchs and nobles. In the 16th century, breakfast became common. Some attribute this to increased food availability, but social changes like new employment patterns also played a role. People started work early, making breakfast a necessity rather than just a status symbol.","Health experts affirm that a good breakfast is undoubtedly important. Historically, breakfast was a relatively recent development in England, with few references in medieval literature. While there were occasional mentions of travellers or the sick eating at dawn, most people abstained unless they were monarchs or nobles. By the 16th century, breakfast gradually became the norm. Proponents of increased food availability as a cause have often overlooked other significant social changes. For instance, new employment patterns, which involved starting work very early, plausibly explain why breakfast gained importance as a necessity, not merely a social indicator.","The significance of a nutritious breakfast is beyond dispute among health experts, yet historically, breakfast was a comparatively recent phenomenon in England, scarcely documented in medieval texts. Admittedly, scattered allusions exist to travellers consuming a meal at dawn before arduous journeys or the infirm partaking for medicinal purposes, but the majority forwent breakfast unless they were of royal or noble stature. However, during the sixteenth century, it progressively became customary rather than exceptional. Some analysts ascribe this shift to the enhanced availability of sustenance, though advocates of this perspective have frequently neglected other profound societal transformations. For example, evolving employment structures, which often entailed commencing labour at an early hour, provide a credible explanation for the heightened emphasis on breakfast, rooted in necessity rather than solely in social standing.","England's breakfast revolution

324,"Mission to Mars 

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally robust. 
This will be the profile of the very first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 actually lead to fruition. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Mars to allow it to return to Earth without burning any more fuel, for fuel efficiency is a priority - the 2018 deadline has been fixed since the next launch window when Mars and Earth align again isn't until 2031. It's a normal order, but the race is on to develop systems involving totally new technologies. Given that these can be put in place soon enough, the spacecraft might just make it. But even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to achieve these ambitious goals will not be in vain, as they will lead to valuable advances for future missions.

It helps future space trips.,"A rich man named Dennis Tito wants to send a married couple to Mars. The couple must be middle-aged and very strong in body and mind. The trip will last 501 days. They will fly in a capsule that goes close to Mars. The capsule will use Mars's gravity to return to Earth without more fuel. This saves fuel. The plan is for 2018 because after that, the next chance is in 2031. It is a difficult mission with new technology. Even if it fails, it will help future space missions.","Dennis Tito, a multi-millionaire, plans to send a middle-aged, married couple on a 501-day mission to Mars. The applicants need to be physically and emotionally strong. The spacecraft will approach within about 160 km of Mars and use its gravity to return to Earth, which saves fuel. This efficiency is important because the launch is set for 2018; the next opportunity when Mars and Earth align is not until 2031.

325,"CRYING 

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance, with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears, at least during childhood, are mainly an expression of helplessness. However, the persistence of crying into adulthood is harder to explain. It seems that the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. 
Tears can undoubtedly have other causes too. We may cry to express sympathy for those suffering terrible injustice. Furthermore, tears can be shed involuntarily, rather to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may cry when watching a sentimental film, but interestingly, this is more likely to occur in company than when we are alone. The social function of crying would seem to be undeniable, but research continues. 

",C2,"Charles Darwin thought people cry for no reason. He was wrong. Scientists say crying is important for social life. A doctor, John Bowlby, said crying helps babies and mothers feel close. Many people think children cry when they need help. But adults cry too, and that is hard to explain. The sound of crying is not as important as the tears we see. Crying may have helped early people trust each other and feel connected. Tears can have other reasons too. We cry when we feel sorry for others who are treated badly. Sometimes we cry without wanting to, like when we hear beautiful music or a sad speech. We might cry at a sad movie, and this happens more with other people than alone. Crying has a social job, but scientists are still studying it.","Charles Darwin believed that human crying had no clear purpose in evolution. He was probably wrong. More recent scientists have noted its social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps form the bond between mother and child. Many experts think tears, especially in childhood, mainly show helplessness. However, crying continues into adulthood, which is harder to understand. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual signal of tears. This may have benefited early human groups by building trust and social connections. Tears can also have other causes. We might cry to show sympathy for people suffering from injustice. Additionally, tears can come involuntarily, such as when hearing inspiring music or emotional speeches, which can be embarrassing. Crying during a sentimental film is more common when with others than alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.","Charles Darwin considered that the human inclination to cry lacked an obvious evolutionary purpose. He was almost certainly mistaken. In more recent times, scientists have emphasized its social significance, with psychiatrist John Bowlby underscoring the role of crying in fostering the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears, particularly during childhood, are primarily an expression of helplessness. Nevertheless, the persistence of crying into adulthood is more difficult to account for. It seems that the auditory aspect of crying becomes considerably less significant than the visual cue it provides. This may have been advantageous for early human communities as a mechanism to promote trust and social cohesion. Tears can undoubtedly arise from other causes as well. We may cry to express empathy for those enduring grave injustices. Furthermore, tears can be shed involuntarily, often to our embarrassment, when we encounter inspiring music or moving oratory. Crying while watching a sentimental film is more likely to occur in the company of others than when alone. The social function of crying appears undeniable, yet investigations continue.","Charles Darwin postulated that the human propensity to cry had no apparent evolutionary rationale. He was almost certainly in error. More recently, scientists have drawn attention to its social implications, with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the function of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many contend that tears, at least in childhood, are chiefly an expression of helplessness. However, the continuation of crying into adulthood is more challenging to elucidate. It appears that the acoustic element of crying becomes substantially less crucial than the visual signal it conveys. This may have conferred advantages upon early human societies by serving as a means to foster trust and social interconnectedness. Tears can indubitably stem from other origins as well. We might cry to manifest sympathy for individuals suffering egregious injustices. Additionally, tears can be shed involuntarily, rather to our chagrin, when we are exposed to inspiring music or poignant speeches. Crying during a sentimental film is more probable in social settings than in solitude. The social utility of crying seems incontrovertible, but scholarly inquiry persists.","Charles Darwin conjectured that the human tendency to cry lacked any evident evolutionary purpose. He was almost certainly incorrect. More contemporaneously, scientists have pointed to its social significance, with psychiatrist John Bowlby accentuating the role of crying in cultivating the attachment between mother and child. Many maintain that tears, at least during childhood, are predominantly an expression of helplessness. Nonetheless, the persistence of crying into adulthood is more arduous to explicate. It seems that the auditory component of crying becomes considerably less consequential than the visual signal it imparts. This may have been propitious for early human communities as a mechanism for promoting trust and social cohesion. Tears can unequivocally have other etiologies as well. We may cry to express sympathy for those subjected to profound injustices. Furthermore, tears can be shed involuntarily, rather to our discomfiture, when we hear inspiring music or moving orations. We may cry when viewing a sentimental film, but intriguingly, this is more likely to transpire in company than in isolation.

326,"Blogging: Confessing to the world 

Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins - online announcements of your where-abouts. The site's point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, 'Hey, I'm at this place' - but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere - not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous - and we are lost. 
Depressing? Perhaps, but don't give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity's temptations and perils - all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it's worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the 'WWW', as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once. 
Hall's ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall's site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he'd fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He'd published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, 'it makes people not trust me'. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to 'make people want to be with you', you'll be disappointed. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company - including some whom she'd mocked - and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the 'online distribution effect': that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we'd never dream of saying in person. But our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes. 
Armstrong's saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of 'mommy bloggers' and her writing supports her house hold. Once a poster child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesn't mean we should. ",C2,"A website said that telling people online where you are can be dangerous. You think you are just saying 'I am here', but you are also telling bad people. The internet lets you share your life with many people. You can become rich or famous. But the internet is big and dangerous. You can get lost. But do not be sad. Some people used the internet a long time ago. They had problems. They lost jobs and friends. They learned about being famous. They were the first bloggers. We can learn from them. In 1994, a student named Justin Hall started putting his life online. He shared stories and photos. Many people read his blog. He wrote about everything. But one day, he stopped because of love problems. He said sharing his life made people not trust him. In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong wrote a blog about her job. Someone at her job saw it, and she lost her job. She was sad and stopped blogging. But later, she started again and wrote about her family. Now she is famous and makes money from her blog. She learned that you can say anything online, but you should be careful.","Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of telling everyone online where you are. You might think you are just saying 'I am at this place', but you are also telling many people, including some you do not want to meet. This shows that sharing too much on the web can have bad sides. The internet gives big chances to share parts of our lives with the world. We might get wealth or fame. So we join the busy internet, sharing personal things like stories and photos. Later, we see it is crowded and risky, and we feel lost. This is depressing, but do not give up. There is a map for this future, made by early internet users. They used the web long ago and found all the dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with fame, all before social media. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have been where we are going now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. In 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting his life on the web. At that time, the web was used by students and scientists. Hall built a big online story of his life with links, photos, and art. In 1996, he began a daily blog, and many readers watched him try new things. Hall wrote about everything and everyone. It was like art. But one day, he stopped his blog because of a love problem. He said sharing his life made people not trust him. The problem of sharing online continues. Sharing is good, but if you think it will make people like you, you might be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. A coworker sent her blog to her bosses, and she was fired. Experts call this the 'online distribution effect': we feel we can say things online that we would not say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. If we ignore this, we can make big mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. She was upset but later got married and started blogging about her family.

However, one day, his site was replaced by a distressed video called Dark Night. His story emerged: he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was given an ultimatum to stop the blog or lose the relationship. He had shared his life online and found that it made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the dilemma remains.

Once an example of web indiscretion, she has mastered controlled self-revelation. Armstrong realized something important: the web allows us to say anything, but that does not mean we should.","Some time ago, a website emphasized the risks associated with public check-ins—online declarations of one's location. The site's message was straightforward: while you may believe you are merely informing others of your whereabouts, you are simultaneously advertising your presence to a broad audience, including individuals you might not wish to encounter. This reinforced the increasing recognition that the frenetic sharing facilitated by the web possesses potential drawbacks. The extensive new opportunities to publish virtually every facet of our lives to a potentially global audience present alluring prospects such as wealth and fame. Consequently, we immerse ourselves in the tumultuous internet, disseminating confessions, personal photographs, and narratives into the digital abyss. Belatedly, we comprehend that these waters are congested and perilous, leaving us disoriented. Depressing? Possibly, but optimism is warranted. This future is charted by a map drafted years ago by a daring cohort of online pioneers. During the web's infancy, they navigated these domains and pinpointed all the hazardous zones. They endured job terminations, formed and severed friendships, and confronted the allure and dangers of celebrity, all preceding the advent of social networking. These trailblazers, the initial wave of what we now term bloggers, have already traversed the path that many of us are embarking upon. Before their accounts fade from collective memory, it is prudent to dedicate time to their experiences. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, commenced posting to the 'WWW', which was predominantly inhabited by graduate students, scientists, and a smattering of precocious adolescents like himself. The web originated at CERN, the international physics laboratory in Switzerland, to enable researchers to share their work more efficiently. Hall, however, perceived an alternative: an avenue to share his existence. Link by link, he constructed a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense network of verbal self-disclosure enriched with imagery and art. In January 1996, responding to a challenge, he initiated a daily blog, attracting numerous readers captivated by his audacious experimentation with the new medium. Hall's philosophy was uncompromising: encounter him, and you might feature on his site; no subject was forbidden. Undoubtedly, this was the endeavor of an exhibitionist, yet it possessed a discipline and aesthetic that only a snob would decline to acknowledge as art. However, one day, visitors to Hall's site found his homepage replaced by a solitary, anguished video entitled Dark Night. His narrative unfolded: he had experienced an intense romantic involvement, but upon chronicling it on his site, he was confronted with the ultimatum 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He had publicized his life on the internet and, Hall lamented, 'it makes people not trust me'. The blog was discontinued, yet the quandary endures. Online sharing is advantageous, but anticipating that your personal chronicle will 'make people want to be with you' leads to disillusionment. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web professional in Los Angeles, maintained a blog named Dooce, where she occasionally documented her experiences at a software company. An anonymous colleague distributed the blog's address to every vice president in her organization—including individuals she had ridiculed—resulting in her dismissal. Scholars examining the peculiar social dynamics of the networked world employ the term 'online distribution effect' to describe this phenomenon: the sensation that we can articulate sentiments online that we would never voice face-to-face. Nevertheless, our digital existences are interwoven with our actual lives. When we disregard this interconnection, we hazard committing grave, life-altering errors. Armstrong's saga concluded favorably. Although distressed by the incident and ceasing to blog for several months, she ultimately married and recommenced her blog with an emphasis on her new family. Presently, she is a prominent figure in the expanding community of 'mommy bloggers', and her literary endeavors sustain her household. Once emblematic of the consequences of online imprudence, she has evolved into a master of regulated self-disclosure. Armstrong has discerned a lesson we should all heed: the web may permit us to express anything, but that does not imply we ought to.","Some time ago, a website underscored the perils of public check-ins—online proclamations of one's location. The site's assertion was unequivocal: whilst one might presume they are simply announcing their presence at a particular venue, they are concurrently broadcasting their mobility to a myriad of individuals globally, not all of whom are desirable encounters. This served to corroborate the escalating cognizance that the fervent sharing enabled by the web may entail adverse ramifications. The prodigious new avenues to publicize any and every dimension of our lives to a potentially worldwide audience proffer enticing possibilities such as affluence and renown. Thus, we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, casting confessions, personal photographs, and narratives into the digital vortex. All too belatedly, we apprehend that the milieu is congested and treacherous, leaving us adrift. Disheartening? Perhaps, yet resignation is unwarranted. This future is delineated by a cartographic guide, drafted years prior by an intrepid cadre of online pioneers. During the nascent era of the web, they sailed these waters and charted all the hazardous shoals. They endured dismissals from employment, forged and dissolved friendships, and navigated the seductions and hazards of celebrity—all antecedent to the inception of social networking. These pioneers, the inaugural wave of what we now designate as bloggers, have already traversed the terrain that the remainder of us appear to be approaching. Prior to their anecdotes scrolling beyond our collective consciousness, it is meritorious to devote some temporal investment to their sagas. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, initiated postings to the 'WWW', as it was then denominated, a domain predominantly populated by graduate students, scientists, and a handful of precocious adolescents akin to him. The web had been conceived at CERN, the international physics laboratory in Switzerland, to facilitate researchers in disseminating their work more efficaciously. Hall, however, discerned an alternative: an opportunity to divulge his existence. Link by link, he erected a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photographs and artistry. In January 1996, on a dare, he commenced a daily blog, and readers congregated to witness the spectacle of a venturesome youth pushing the boundaries of this nascent medium in multifarious directions simultaneously. Hall's ethos was absolute: cross his trajectory and you might materialize on his site; no topic was taboo. Indubitably, this constituted the work of an exhibitionist, yet it also embodied a rigor and beauty that only a snob would eschew categorizing as art. Nevertheless, one day, visitors to Hall's site discovered his homepage supplanted by a solitary, anguished video entitled Dark Night. His narrative unraveled; he had succumbed to a spectacular amorous infatuation, but upon commencing to chronicle it on his site, he was presented with the ultimatum 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He had publicized his life on the internet and, Hall protested, 'it makes people not trust me'. The blog was terminated, yet the predicament persists. Sharing online is commendable, but if one anticipates that their soliloquy of self will 'make people want to be with you', disillusionment is inevitable. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a youthful web operative in Los Angeles, maintained a blog denominated Dooce. Intermittently, she documented her occupational experiences at a software corporation. One day, an anonymous colleague disseminated the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president within her company—including some whom she had derided—precipitating the termination of her employment. Those who scrutinize the idiosyncratic social patterns of the networked world have coined the term 'online distribution effect' to encapsulate the operative dynamic: that sensation many of us harbor that we can articulate sentiments online with impunity that we would never contemplate expressing in person. However, our digital lives are inextricably interwoven with our corporeal existences. When we feign otherwise, we imperil committing egregious, life-altering blunders. Armstrong's chronicle culminated in a felicitous denouement. Though she was disconcerted by the episode and desisted from blogging for several months subsequently, she ultimately entered matrimony and recommenced her blog with a focus on her nascent family. Presently, she is a luminary within the burgeoning ranks of 'mommy bloggers', and her literary output sustains her household. Once a paragon of the repercussions of web indiscretion, she has metamorphosed into a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has ascertained is a precept we would all be prudent to internalize: the web may empower us to articulate anything, but that does not necessitate that we should.","Blogging: Confessing to the world 

Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins - online announcements of your where-abouts. The site's point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, 'Hey, I'm at this place' - but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere - not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous - and we are lost. 
Depressing? Perhaps, but don't give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity's temptations and perils - all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it's worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the 'WWW', as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once. 
Hall's ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall's site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he'd fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He'd published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, 'it makes people not trust me'. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to 'make people want to be with you', you'll be disappointed. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company - including some whom she'd mocked - and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the 'online distribution effect': that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we'd never dream of saying in person. But our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes. 
Armstrong's saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of 'mommy bloggers' and her writing supports her house hold. Once a poster child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation. What Armstrong has figured out is something we would all do well to remember: the web may allow us to say anything, but that doesn't mean we should. "
327,"Build it yourself at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop 

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and apart from a mechanic deep in the bowels of a truck, the only sign of life among the small factories on a backstreet is a whine of machinery from an upper window - work has begun at Bamboo Bike Club, Britain's only bamboo bike-building course. I've gone along to watch the action. 
There's a sense of energy and industry. And of fun. Woodwork class was never like this. Bamboo is one of the most interesting trends to emerge in bike construction. Names like Californian manufacturer Calfee Design or Yorkshire's Bamboo Bikes have revived a construction method pioneered as early as 1894. The problem for most cyclists is the price. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies retails for $2,995, or PS1,868. 
It was this, plus the design challenge, that led James and Ian to spend years cooped up in a shed in Brecon, Wales. Their idea was to establish a boutique bamboo bike business with products within reach of the average cyclist. 
Only after they had refined their research into a marketable product - James now tosses out phrases like 'close-noded thick-wall tubes' while talking about bamboo - did they realise they were on the wrong track. 'We realised we didn't want just to sell frames. We wanted to share the joy of making something; the craft of creating something unique and sustainable,' James explains. 
The outcome was something more community than company, and as such, the Bamboo Bike Club is still an occupation sandwiched between full-time jobs - James makes wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they seem to be on the right track, with monthly courses whose competitive price buys you a computer-designed custom bike frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 
The question for me, a king of the botch job - my terrible handiwork failures litter my house - was about quality. On day one, the boys explain how to select bamboo for strength and how to form strong joints before tubes are glued lightly in place in the workshop: first the front triangle composed of 40 mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more fiddly seat and the chain assembly. Alloy tubes are inserted for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts which require the strength and precise engineering impossible in bamboo. 
All this, together with the technical skill involved in using jigs, power tools and design blueprints, is a leap of faith for someone whose idea of DIY is flatpack furniture assembly. Accurate cutting for a clean joint can be tricky, for example. 
James and Ian buzz cheerfully between workbenches, supervising every cut, triple-checking every joint, and will take over if a task seems insurmountable. The self-build is half the attraction for most participants; it may be no coincidence that all those on this course were engineers. For the rest of us, Ian reassures that everyone messes up once or twice. 
No problem - just get another piece and have another go. Such is the benefit of bamboo. Each length has been pre-checked for quality, so you get to indulge in frame aesthetics: plain bamboo, black or mottled. 
Sunday is a more relaxed day, mainly spent building the lugs. Or rather, wraps: hemp bindings wrapped around the joints and dropouts then glued with epoxy resin to form a strong bond that disperses loads evenly throughout the frame. With a final polymer coating for waterproofing, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any other individual touches. And it is a bike built for the long haul, just as strong, the pair claim, as its metal equivalents. 
Ian has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, while James has failed to destroy one bike off-road over three months of testing. 'To be honest, our bikes are over-engineered - we use larger diameter tubes and over-thick bindings - but I prefer it like that,' James says. 
Technical issues aside, how good does a bamboo bike look? Somewhat scruffy alongside professional frames, it turns out - the hemp weave can look a bit like parcel tape, for example. But there's no denying their individuality and that, say James and Ian, is the point. 
Personally though, I believe that any bicycle made from this kind of material should be a relaxed affair, something for cruising sedately around on rather than racing. I therefore plump for a frame that avoids the stiff angularity of my existing metal machine: a 'Classic English' giving a gentle, easy-going ride. 
They also cycle well. I take James's bike for a spin and the ride is light, stiff and smooth thanks to bamboo's ability to dampen vibration. Impressive, considering I target every pothole. 'Some people love the build, but for me these workshops come together when the bike is on the road,' James says. 'They're so light, so effortless to ride. So much fun to ride too - take a Harley-style retro bike, add 10 and you're still not close.' And the price? Less than PS500. ",C2,"You can make your own bike at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop.

Bamboo has surfaced as a compelling trend in bicycle construction, rejuvenating techniques pioneered as early as 1894 by entities such as Calfee Design, albeit with pre-assembled frames commanding steep prices. Motivated by the exorbitant costs and a passion for design, James and Ian devoted years to refining their approach, ultimately prioritising the dissemination of craft and sustainable creation over mere commerce. The workshop entails meticulous selection of bamboo for structural integrity, formation of robust joints, and application of hemp bindings sealed with epoxy resin, all under vigilant supervision to overcome technical challenges. The resultant bicycle, fortified with alloy components and a polymer finish, delivers a lightweight, vibration-absorbent ride comparable to metal counterparts, retailing for under £500 and epitomising bespoke, enduring craftsmanship.","Build it yourself at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop

328,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. She would drive around the allotments and the railway line and gasworks, shooting the tiny hump-backed bridge with all four wheels in the air and a tremendous bump (Lily's only misjudgement), before completing the journey by the gasworks in an odour of sulphur and brimstone. Chen, however, was actually amused by what his wife had been doing behind his back. 'So you can really drive it then, Lily? Well done!'
Men were strange creatures, Mui thought. Brother-in-law should have been upset about this. Yet he was soon enthusiastically making plans with Lily for a jaunt and obviously revelling in her mastery of this new skill.
They fixed on a Monday at the beginning of next month. This was the slackest day of the week, they decided to leave early in the morning and return by midday. That way they need lose no customers. In the meantime Lily would practise around the allotments.
Resolved to go along with the majority despite her personal misgivings, Mui had been to buy a road-map. She had been able to get a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, though Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of faith in her navigating abilities.
Within an hour of stepping over the newspapers and out of the front door, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily had driven impeccably. Even Mui, sitting in the back ready to give directions, one hand on the cross-braces of Man Kee's rompers as he pressed his nose against the window, had to grant this. On the road Lily had actually overtaken a couple of laggard vehicles with immense verve and such timing that Mui had pressed her lips closely together against her own protest. Chen went as far as applauding.
Now, after coming through the gasworks of this seaside town (reassuring, familiar sight), past the lagoon and its miniature motor boats, they were moving smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the sea front which was full of empty bays.
She was unclear about the meanings of the various roadmarkings and preferred to pay a fee rather than risk being towed away. Or even being served with a summons. Might this evidence of basic prudence set Mui's mind at rest? On the way down Lily had several times observed her elder sister's taut face in the driving mirror, which she used with great frequency. Perhaps it would be best not to put worries in Mui's mind which would not have occurred to her in the first place. Lily personally locked all the van doors and meticulously tested each in turn.
'Don't worry,' Chen joked. 'No one will want that heap of tin.' The girls bristled. Lily accused her husband of ingratitude. Mui rebuked him for being proud and too readily deceived by appearances.
Taken aback, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the two sisters to look at the grey barbarian sea. He perched Son on the top railing and put his arms around his stomach. Man Kee was a soft, warm, and what was more, these days an increasingly responsive bundle. He reacted by putting his hand, a tiny replica of the shape of Chen's, with its broad palm and stubby fingers, on his father's sleeve.
And it was in that moment that Chen resolved to bring Son up his way. He would have an education in figures (Chen's own weak point) and grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience in all aspects of the trade on the way. The sombre sea put Chen in a pleasing melancholy as he planned Man Kee's career.
There was a trail of smoke just before the horizon met the sea in a thin line and then, suddenly shimmering in the glitter of the rising morning sun on the metal waves, a hull; and in a small cute of the railings was a grey telescope. The sparkle of the water instantly altered Chen's mood.
He put a coin in the slot and trained the glass on the ship. He was unable to find it at first, although he had aimed off carefully with the gun-sight on top of the barrel. Chen swung the tube in wide circles. There it was! Gone again. Chen swivelled the instrument more carefully. Now he had it in the centre of the circle, surprisingly large, red, and very rusty with a small bow wave: tramp steamer.
Chen lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. 'Do you see the ship, Son?' he asked softly. 'It is a special little ship for people like us, Son. It is very little and very old but that is only what strangers see. We know better, don't we, Son, because it is the ship that will take us all back home when we are finished here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen.'
Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Behind him now were Lily and Mui. Lily put her arm round Husband's shoulders. 'The little old ship,' said Chen. 'Let your mother see, Son.'
Man Kee would not be parted from the telescope and when he had been persuaded to relinquish his grip the whirring inside the mounting had stopped and all Lily could see was a quivering opaque circle of white light with a scratched surface. By the time Chen had found a second coin the ship was over the horizon and Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake.",C2,"Two sisters, Lily and Mui, did not tell Chen that Lily could drive. Lily drove near gardens, a train line, and a gas factory. She drove fast over a small bridge. Chen was happy when he found out. He said, 'Well done, Lily!' Mui thought men are strange. Chen was not angry. He and Lily planned a trip for next month. They would go on Monday morning and come back at noon. Mui bought a map. She got it for less money. Lily drove to the sea very well. Mui was surprised. Chen clapped. They parked by the sea. Lily paid to park so the car would not be taken. Chen joked about the car. The sisters were upset. Chen walked with his son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Chen held Man Kee. Chen decided his son would learn about numbers and have many restaurants. Chen saw a ship far away. He used a telescope to see it. He showed Man Kee the ship. Chen said the ship would take them home one day. Lily and Mui came. Lily looked but saw only white light and birds.","The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. Lily drove around the allotments, railway line, and gasworks. She went quickly over a small bridge, making a big bump. Chen was amused when he learned about it. He said, 'So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!' Mui thought men were strange because Chen was not upset. Instead, he made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday morning next month and return by midday. Mui bought a road map with a discount, which Chen liked, but Lily felt a bit insulted. Lily drove to the English Channel very well. Mui, sitting in the back, had to admit it was good. Chen applauded. They parked in a street by the sea. Lily paid for parking to avoid problems. Chen joked that no one would want their old van, making the sisters angry. Chen took Man Kee to see the sea. He decided Man Kee would learn about numbers and own restaurants. Chen saw a ship and used a telescope. He showed it to Man Kee, saying it would take them home one day. Lily looked but saw only white light and seagulls.","The two sisters, Lily and Mui, concealed Lily's driving from Chen for a period. Lily would drive around the allotments, railway line, and gasworks, accelerating over a small bridge with a noticeable bump. Chen was actually amused upon discovering this and praised Lily's ability. Mui found it odd that Chen was not angry; instead, he enthusiastically planned a trip with Lily. They scheduled it for a Monday morning the following month to avoid losing customers. Mui purchased a road map at a discount, which impressed Chen but slightly offended Lily. During the drive to the English Channel, Lily performed impeccably, even overtaking slower vehicles, which made Mui suppress her concerns. After parking near the sea, Lily paid a fee to prevent towing or fines, hoping to reassure Mui. Chen made a joke about their van being worthless, causing the sisters to react defensively. Chen then took his son, Man Kee, to view the sea, where he resolved to educate him in figures and restaurant management. Spotting a ship, Chen used a telescope to show it to Man Kee, describing it as a vessel that would one day return them to their homeland. When Lily looked through the telescope, she saw only a blurred image and seagulls.","The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time. Lily drove around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, navigating a small bridge with a significant bump as her only error. Chen was amused rather than upset upon learning of this and commended Lily's driving skills. Mui thought it peculiar that Chen was not angered; he instead made enthusiastic plans with Lily for an outing. They chose a Monday morning the following month, deeming it the least busy day to minimize impact on their business. Mui bought a road map with a ten percent discount, which Chen found impressive, though Lily felt somewhat insulted by the implication she needed navigation help. On the journey to the English Channel, Lily drove flawlessly, overtaking slower vehicles with such skill that Mui withheld her objections, and Chen applauded. After parking in a seaside street, Lily opted to pay a parking fee to avoid potential towing or a summons, hoping to ease Mui's worries. Chen's joke about the van being a 'heap of tin' provoked defensive reactions from the sisters. Taking Man Kee to the sea, Chen resolved to raise him with an education in figures and aspirations of owning multiple restaurants. Observing a ship through a telescope, Chen described it as a means to return to their homeland, but when Lily looked, the view was obscured, showing only seagulls.","The two sisters, Lily and Mui, maintained the secrecy of Lily's driving from Chen for a considerable duration. Lily would maneuver around the allotments, the railway line, and the gasworks, traversing the diminutive hump-backed bridge with all wheels airborne and a substantial jolt—her sole miscalculation—before concluding the route amidst an odour of sulphur and brimstone. Chen, however, was genuinely entertained by his wife's clandestine activities and lauded her proficiency. Mui reflected on the peculiarity of men, expecting Chen to be displeased, yet he promptly engaged in planning an excursion with Lily, evidently delighting in her newfound competence. They settled on a Monday at the onset of the subsequent month, the most inactive day, intending to depart early and return by midday to avert customer loss. Mui, acquiescing to the majority despite her reservations, procured a road-map at a ten percent discount, which Chen admired, though Lily perceived it as a slight on her navigational capabilities. En route to the English Channel, Lily drove impeccably, overtaking laggard vehicles with such verve and precision that Mui compressed her lips against protest, while Chen expressed approval through applause. Upon arriving, they parked in a seaside street, and Lily, uncertain of road markings, paid a fee to preclude towing or a summons, pondering if this prudence might assuage Mui's apprehensions. Chen's jest about the van being a 'heap of tin' incited bristling responses from the sisters, who accused him of ingratitude and superficial judgment. Retreating with Man Kee, Chen observed the sombre sea, resolving to educate his son in figures and cultivate a career in restaurant ownership. Spotting a ship, he employed a telescope, describing it as the vessel that would eventually repatriate them, but when Lily attempted to view it, the instrument yielded only an opaque, quivering circle and scavenging seagulls.","The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for some time.

Chen lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. 'Do you see the ship, Son?' he asked softly. 'It is a special little ship for people like us, Son. It is very little and very old but that is only what strangers see. We know better, don't we, Son, because it is the ship that will take us all back home when we are finished here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen.'
Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Behind him now were Lily and Mui. Lily put her arm round Husband's shoulders. 'The little old ship,' said Chen. 'Let your mother see, Son.'
Man Kee would not be parted from the telescope and when he had been persuaded to relinquish his grip the whirring inside the mounting had stopped and all Lily could see was a quivering opaque circle of white light with a scratched surface. By the time Chen had found a second coin the ship was over the horizon and Lily was left with a view of seagulls scavenging gash in the wake."
329,"I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals, and I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I suppose that by the exercise of invention I could fill the gaps plausibly enough and so make my narrative more coherent; but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know.
To save embarrassment to people still living I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving, and I have in other ways taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.
I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I never kept notes of what was said on this or the other occasions, but I have a good memory for what concerns me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words they faithfully represent, I believe, what was said. I remarked a little while back that I have invented nothing but I have taken the liberty that historians have taken to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard. I have done this for the same reasons that the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted. I want to be read and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make my book readable. The intelligent reader will easily see for himself where I have used this artifice, and he is at perfect liberty to reject it.
Another reason that has caused me to embark upon this work with apprehension is that the persons I have chiefly to deal with are of another culture. It is very difficult to know people and I don't think one can ever really know any but one's own countrymen. For men and women are not only themselves; they are also the region in which they were born, the city apartment or the farm in which they learnt to walk, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed and the poets they read. It is all these things that have made them what they are, and these are the things that you cant come to know by hearsay, you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you cannot know persons of a nation foreign to you except from observation, it is difficult to give them credibility in the pages of a book. I have never attempted to deal with any but my own countrymen, and if I have ventured to do otherwise in short stories it is because in them you can treat your characters more summarily. You give the reader broad indications and leave him to fill in the details. In this book, I do not pretend that my characters are as they would see themselves; they are seen, as is my main character, through my own eyes.",C2,"I am not sure about this book. I call it a novel, but I do not know what else to call it. The story is not long. It does not end with a death or a marriage. I write about a man I knew sometimes. I do not know much about his life in between. I could make up parts to make the story better, but I do not want to. I only write what I know. I change the names of people so no one knows them. The man is not famous. Maybe no one will remember him. Maybe my book will be read for its own interest. Or maybe people will see he was a good man and want to know about him. My book might help others write about him. I did not write down the talks word for word. I remember them and write them in my words. I sometimes add talks I did not hear to make the book more interesting. Smart readers will see this. Also, the people in the book are from another place. It is hard to know people from other countries. You need to live like them to really know them. I usually write about people from my own country. In short stories, it is easier. In this book, I show the people as I see them.","I started this book with worry. I call it a novel because I do not know a better name. There is not much story, and it does not end with a death or marriage. I leave the reader without a clear end. The book is about my memories of a man I met only now and then. I do not know what happened to him between our meetings. I could invent things to fill the gaps and make the story smoother, but I choose not to. I only want to write what I truly know. To protect living people, I have given them made-up names and changed details so no one can identify them. The man I write about is not famous. He might never be famous. When he dies, he might leave no mark, like a stone thrown in water. Then, if people read my book, it will be for its own interest. Or, his way of life and good character might influence others, and after his death, people may see he was remarkable. Then, it will be clear who I wrote about, and readers might find useful information about his early life. I think my book can help future biographers. I did not record conversations exactly. I never took notes, but I have a good memory. I write the talks in my own words, but I believe they are true. Sometimes, I add speeches I did not hear, like historians do, to make scenes more lively and real. I want people to read my book, and I think this is okay. Intelligent readers will notice where I did this and can ignore it. Another reason I am worried is that the people in the book are from a different culture. It is very difficult to understand people from other countries. People are shaped by where they were born, how they grew up, what they ate, and what they read. You cannot know these things just by hearing about them; you must experience them yourself. I usually write about my own countrymen. In short stories, it is easier because you can describe characters briefly. In this book, I do not say my characters see themselves as I do; I show them through my eyes.","I began this novel with great uncertainty. If I refer to it as a novel, it is only because no other term fits. There is little plot to relate, and it concludes without a death or marriage, leaving the reader somewhat unresolved. This book contains my recollections of a man with whom I had occasional close contact, and I lack detailed knowledge of his life during the intervals. I could use imagination to fill in the gaps and create a more coherent narrative, but I have no desire to do so. My intention is simply to record what I know. To avoid causing embarrassment to living individuals, I have assigned fictitious names to the characters and taken other measures to ensure they remain unrecognisable. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never achieve fame. It is possible that upon his death, he will leave no more impression than a stone tossed into a river. If my book is read, it may be solely for its inherent interest. Alternatively, his chosen lifestyle and the distinctive strength and kindness of his character could exert a growing influence on others, leading to a posthumous recognition of his remarkable nature. In that case, my book would clearly identify him and provide valuable insights into his early life for future biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I have recorded are exact quotations. I never made notes of what was said on various occasions, but I have a reliable memory for relevant details. Although I have expressed these dialogues in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect the actual discussions. I have occasionally taken the liberty, as historians do, to invent speeches for characters that I did not witness, in order to add vitality and realism to scenes that would otherwise be dull. I want the book to be engaging, and I feel justified in this approach. Astute readers will easily identify these invented parts and are free to disregard them. Another source of my apprehension is that the main subjects of this book belong to a different culture. Understanding people from other nations is challenging, as individuals are profoundly influenced by their birthplace, upbringing, childhood activities, diet, education, hobbies, and literary influences. These elements cannot be fully grasped through secondhand accounts; they require personal experience. Typically, I write about my compatriots, but in short stories, I can depict foreign characters more superficially. In this book, I do not assert that my portrayals match the characters' self-perceptions; they are filtered through my perspective.","I have commenced this novel with considerable trepidation. If I designate it as a novel, it is merely for lack of an alternative description. The narrative is sparse, and it concludes without the conventional resolutions of death or marriage, thereby leaving the reader in a state of uncertainty. This work comprises my reminiscences of a man with whom I was intimately acquainted only intermittently, and I possess scant information about the intervening periods of his life. Although I could employ creative invention to bridge these gaps and render the account more seamless, I am disinclined to do so. My sole aim is to document what I authentically know. To prevent embarrassment for those still alive, I have bestowed upon the individuals in this story names of my own devising and have implemented additional precautions to guarantee their anonymity. The subject of my writing is not renowned, and it is plausible that he never will be. Upon his demise, he may leave no more trace of his existence than a stone cast into a river leaves upon the water's surface. Consequently, if my book is perused at all, it may be valued purely for its intrinsic merit. However, it is also conceivable that the manner of living he has elected and the exceptional fortitude and gentleness of his disposition could exert an increasingly significant impact on his contemporaries, such that, long after his death, it might be acknowledged that an extraordinary individual inhabited this era. In that event, the identity of my subject will become evident, and those seeking insights into his formative years may discover pertinent material in this volume. I consider my book, within its recognised constraints, to be a beneficial resource for future biographers. I do not assert that the dialogues I have transcribed are verbatim reproductions. I never maintained records of spoken words on any occasion, but I retain a proficient memory for matters that concern me, and while I have articulated these exchanges in my own idiom, I am confident they faithfully represent the substance of what was uttered. I have, on occasion, adopted the prerogative exercised by historians to compose speeches for characters that I did not personally hear and could not have overheard, in order to imbue scenes with vibrancy and authenticity that would otherwise be lacklustre if merely described. My desire is for the book to be read, and I believe I am warranted in enhancing its readability. Discerning readers will readily discern where I have utilised this device and are entirely at liberty to discount it. An additional factor contributing to my apprehensiveness is that the principal figures in this narrative hail from a disparate culture. Comprehending individuals from foreign backgrounds is exceedingly arduous, for people are not solely defined by their personal attributes but also by the locale of their birth, the urban or rural setting of their upbringing, their childhood pursuits, culinary habits, educational institutions, athletic interests, and literary preferences. These facets, which collectively shape their identity, cannot be apprehended through hearsay alone; they necessitate firsthand immersion. Ordinarily, I confine my writings to my fellow countrymen, and any forays into depicting foreign characters in short stories are feasible only because such formats permit more abbreviated characterisations. In this book, I do not profess that my depictions align with the characters' self-images; they are perceived, as with the central figure, through my subjective lens.","I have never initiated a novel with greater misgiving. If I categorise it as a novel, it is solely due to the absence of a more apt designation. I possess a limited narrative to impart, and I conclude neither with a death nor a marriage, instead abandoning the reader in a state of suspense. This volume consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrust into close proximity only at protracted intervals, and I have inadequate knowledge of the events that transpired in the interims. I surmise that through the application of invention, I could plausibly fill the lacunae and thereby render my narrative more coherent; however, I have no inclination to pursue that course. I merely aspire to set down what I know. To avert embarrassment for individuals still living, I have assigned to the personages in this chronicle appellations of my own contrivance, and I have taken other pains to ensure that no one should recognise them. The man about whom I am writing is not eminent; it is conceivable that he never will be. It may be that when his life ultimately terminates, he will leave no more vestige of his earthly sojourn than a stone hurled into a river leaves upon the aqueous surface. Then my book, if it is perused at all, will be read exclusively for whatever intrinsic interest it may harbour. But it is possible that the modus vivendi he has elected for himself and the peculiar vigour and sweetness of his character may exert an ever-expanding influence over his fellow men, so that, long posthumously perhaps, it may be realised that there dwelt in this epoch a truly remarkable being. Then it will be unequivocally apparent whom I delineate in this book, and those desirous of acquiring at least a modicum of intelligence regarding his nascent years may find therein something serviceable to their objectives. I deem my book, within its acknowledged limitations, to be a utilitarian source of intelligence for my friend's biographers. I do not pretend that the conversations I have documented can be regarded as verbatim reports; I never preserved annotations of what was uttered on this or other occasions, but I possess a retentive memory for matters that impinge upon me, and though I have rendered these colloquies in my own phraseology, they faithfully represent, I believe, what was articulated. I remarked previously that I have invented nothing, but I have appropriated the liberty that historians have assumed to place into the mouths of the personages in my narrative orations that I did not personally audit and could not possibly have heard. I have executed this for the identical rationales that historians have, to confer liveliness and verisimilitude upon scenes that would have been ineffectual if they had been merely recounted. I desire to be read, and I consider myself justified in executing whatever I can to render my book perusable. The intelligent reader will effortlessly discern for himself where I have employed this artifice, and he is at perfect liberty to repudiate it. Another rationale that has induced me to embark upon this work with apprehension is that the individuals with whom I must primarily engage are of an alien culture. It is profoundly challenging to apprehend people, and I do not believe one can ever genuinely comprehend any but one's own compatriots. For men and women are not merely themselves; they are also the region in which they were born, the metropolitan apartment or the agrarian holding in which they learnt to ambulate, the diversions they pursued as juveniles, the sustenance they consumed, the academies they attended, the athletic pursuits they followed, and the poets they perused. It is all these constituents that have fabricated them into what they are, and these are the elements that one cannot assimilate by hearsay; one can only know them if one has inhabited them. One can only know if one is them. And because one cannot apprehend persons of a nation foreign to oneself except through observation, it is arduous to endow them with credibility in the pages of a book. I have never endeavoured to deal with any but my own countrymen, and if I have hazarded to do otherwise in short stories, it is because in them one can treat one's characters more summarily. One furnishes the reader with broad indications and permits him to interpolate the particulars. In this book, I do not pretend that my characters are as they would perceive themselves; they are envisaged, as is my principal character, through my own ocular perspective.","I have never begun a novel with more misgiving.

330,"Othello

The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. Indeed the whole cast is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with the other young officers get dangerously out of hand, and the moment when Iago begins to lose control and has to struggle to get a grip on himself. And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production.

Lake Vostok

In the heart of Antarctica, nothing stirs. On the fringes of the continent there are penguins, seals and birds aplenty. But up on the great white plateau in the interior, life has no foothold. Except, that is, in a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometres of ice, directly below the coldest spot on earth. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists can hardly wait to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within. Geologists and glaciologists are hot on their heels. For two years now, researchers round the world have been plotting ways to uncover the lakes secrets, and, if they get their wish, in the next few years we will witness the decade of Lake Vostok.

There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists; the expression 'because it's there' springs to mind.

But what these guys want to know is why we want to know all of this in the first place and why can't science explain why we want to know?

Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than get bogged down in debates over the point of it all. I would have thought that the crucial issue here is not why we pursue it, but to recognise that science is a tool, and we are the ones who should decide how, where, when and why to use it."
