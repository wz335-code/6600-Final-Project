"We stayed for 2 nights 14th &amp; 15th October, having booked on lastminute.com.",A2
The lobby and bar are very modern which seems incongruous with a historic exterior in the heart of the lower old town.,C1
"Plus the room needs to be cleaned, not just masked, as the unsprayed room reeked of vomit, urine and stale beer.",B1
They also have a few restaurants in the building itself which we did not go to but are highly rated.,B1
"Each night the staff turned on music on the Bose sound system (a different selection each night), set some mood lighting (remote controlled flickering candles in the bedroom!",B2

"However, for now, I'll say that it worked because of all the set-up and backstory that Levee was given.I had never heard of the play that this was based on before now, but watching the film made me curious to do some research.Aside from a tiny section in the middle of the film, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom was mesmerising.",C1
The animation is phenomenal and breathtaking and Pete Doctor's direction is superb.,B1
Matt Smith is a perfect foil.,B1
"While the show seemed to lose its way a bit in the later episodes, it was ultimately an engaging murder mystery.",A2
Vanessa Kirby is a bit indelicate for Margaret - maybe a bit large.,B1

Time moving forwards and backwards at the same time is mind blowing.,B1
Elf seems to have become a Christmas Classic over the years.,A2
The action and adventure keeps you glued and the discovery of one little cute pointy long eared green baby is a nice wild card and supporting theme for the series.,B1
"In the same office, the lonely Sarah not-so- secretly pines for a man just a few desks away, who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses.",C1
"Also, the number of one time only reviews giving this joke of a period drama scores of 8 or higher demonstrates that Netflix is paying trolls to populate IMDB with positive reviews to counter the outrage felt by fans of the source material.",B2
Actors are superb.,A2
Kenneth Branagh does his best fake Russian accent and seems every inch the Bond villain.,B1

"Anyway, The Midnight Sky is a Netflix production like many: hire some known actors, put some money into the production and technical staff and voila you got a new movie.",B1
"Perhaps too generous, when his Building and Loan business was in trouble he was contemplating suicide as a way out, thinking the world would be better off if George Bailey had never existed.An angel is sent down to intervene, in the last third of the movie George gets to see exactly how his town would have been and in the process gets his head straight.Donna Reed (23 at the time) played his wife Mary who would have been the stereotypical ""old maid librarian"" if George had never existed.Filmed in glorious B&W, the film holds up very well all these years later when one pits it against other very old movies.",C1
The flashback to young Lofthouse is rather unnecessary.,A2
"Cargo containers, pick up sticks for space ships, machine gun style lasers, where does the story begin...?",B1
"I am truly sorry, for this was an excellent film, that is perfect for the Christmas holiday season.",B1

For the first time in her life she has confidence and strength.,A2
"Richard Curtis, from my perspective, deserves both panning and praise for his first film as a writer/director, Love Actually- it's loaded to the brim with nearly every kind of relationship/romance/infidelity convention you can think of, wedged into eight different couples intertwined together in merry old England.",B2
Do not watch this if you thought it was going to be like downton abbey or the crown.,A2
"I didn't read the other reviews, but from some of the posters, I gather there were viewers who wanted something deeper.",B1
It wasn't my style as it wasn't really a crime thriller it was definitely more on the 'comedy' side (although I didn't laugh).,A2

Have you ever seen Stallone look scared?,A2

I didn't bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back.,A2
"I ordered a screen for an iPhone 8 Plus, but recevied product that was for a different phone.",A2
The wires did not last long at all.,A2
The dragon was missing paint and there was glue or something all over the dragon.,A2
They were not stitched.,A2
I am very annoyed because it came a day late and it didn’t come with the ferro rod and striker which is the main reason why I ordered it,B2
I mean the case looks cool.,A1
On first use it didn't heat up and now it doesn't work at all,A2
Shame you can't give it 0 stars I ordered this and the package says shipped but I did not receive the package contacted the seller 2 times and still no answer after two weeks very disappointed.,B2
I feel ripped off.,A1
Never received item.,A1
It seems to have lots of fat (a white greasy substance) in it!,A2
This happened even though I was careful to not gum up the lid or tapering snout.,B2
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.",B1
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.",B2
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.,B1
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",B1
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.,B1
"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.",A2
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.",B1
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!,B1
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,A2
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.,B2
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.",A2
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).,A2

"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.",B1
"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.",A1
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,A2
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,B1
"I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!",A2

"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.",B1
"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.",B1
"Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.",B1
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,B1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,B2
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,B1
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.,A2
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.",B1
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,B2

I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,B1

I would not suggest this place!,A1

"To investigate the mechanisms behind any march and non-march diﬀerences, we augment the Haines (2010) demographic information with three other data sets.",B2
"In various formats, historical DB data have recently been used by several papers in (1995) documents under-enumeration in the 1870 census in North Carolina of African Americas, particularly union veterans",B2
Standard errors are always clustered at county-level,B2
"For the rest of this section, we provide some direct evidence on the importance of the ﬁnancial channel in explaining the relative downturns from the Sherman destruction.",B2
Banks and credit were both scarce in the postbellum period,B1
As historians have documented—and as we conﬁrmed—the course was plotted based on available economic data from the 1860 census.,B2
"This result suggests that while manufacturing contracted in the medium-run, over a longer horizon the eﬀect of the march on manufacturing was small",C1
"However, as also suggested by Figure 5, this measure may be endogenous to the march itself as post-1864 banking recovery could be a function of the recovery in manufacturing.",C1
"Comparing march to non-march counties using our diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences speciﬁcation, we ﬁnd economically large and statistically signiﬁcant post-march diﬀerences among agricultural outcomes",C1
We use data on contemporary marriage records to show that data quality does not seem to be diﬀerent across treatment and control counties in the census.,B2
"In our case, the faster recovery of manufacturing may be related to the overall booming in the manufacturing sector experienced in the United States during the post-war period.",B2
"With this paper, we contribute to three related literatures.",A2
The industry group is generated using the industry groupings introduced in the Census of Manufactures in 1900,B2
"We are slightly limited by the data in assessing the pre-treatment period: the Census of Agriculture collected information on the farm size distribution starting in 1860, not in 1850 as with our other analyses",C1
"Sherman’s destruction extended even to paperwork: in a study of bankruptcy cases in postbellum South Carolina, Thompson (2004) describes several claimants blaming Sherman for destroying their records and complicating the unwinding of debt obligations",B2
"Overall, this analysis shows that the capital destruction caused by Sherman’s march substantially aﬀected the local agricultural economy, with the eﬀects still visible in 1870, six years later.",B2
"Conﬂict and other disasters have caused destruction and economic mayhem throughout human history, but the study of their eﬀects on growth remains limited.",C1
This measure is consistently employed across the 1850–1920 US Censuses of Agriculture.,B2
We deﬁne the intensity in cotton production as the dollar value of ginned cotton production per total farming acres; a plantation farm as a farm with more than one hundred slaves in 1860; and slave intensity as the average number of slave per farm.,B2
"The breadth of James Crawford’s work as an academic and practitioner of international law is astonishing: from boundary delimitation, to foundational sources questions, to the complexities of International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) annulment, little seemed beyond his grasp or his interest.",C1
"Today’s students and practitioners of international law effortlessly use many of the ILC’s more burdensome terms, such as ‘State other than the injured State’ and ‘circumstances precluding wrongfulness’ (where ‘defences’ might have done).",C2
"The Articles, grounded as they are in customary law, are amenable to such refinement and adaptation through State practice.",B2
"Third, in the field of human rights, according to the UN Secretariat’s technical report listing international decisions that cite the Articles, by 2017 the Articles had been referred to in 65 decisions by the regional human rights courts and the Human Rights Committee combined.",B2
"In our view, the status of the ILC Articles is best captured in a third statement, also offered with the benefit of hindsight: ‘The Articles have encoded the way in which we think about [State] responsibility’.",B2
"Overall, it seems clear that the Articles have stood the test of time.",A2
"Some scholars, like Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga and Hubert Thierry, eschewed the element of fault but continued to require damage as a necessary element of responsibility (that is, in the ILC’s terminology, as a matter of secondary rules).",B2
It would be wrong (and out of character) to read this as the view of an architect worried that ‘his project’ might be dismantled or disfigured.,B2
"For many, the lesson learned from The Hague Codification Conference’s failure was that codification of responsibility by focusing on injury to foreigners was unproductive.",B2
But there is more to the Articles than subject-matter relevance.,B2
"Despite the growing specialisation of responsibility within certain fields of international law, the Articles have shown, in Katja Creutz’s terms, ‘tenacity’: sometimes in the foreground and sometimes in the background, they have remained at the centre of the law of responsibility.",C1
This was indeed profitable: it is because of their generality that the ILC Articles rather quickly supplanted other ways of thinking about responsibility in international law.,B2
"To conclude on this first point, it seems to us that, while the ILC did not invent the law of State responsibility, its approach is now the only meaningful path to understanding it.",B2
This was not an easy task.,A1
"Specifically, in his view, the Articles have become an indispensable resource in assessing State responsibility for violations of international humanitarian law.",B2
"We saw, in contrast, how Leiris concretely encounters an obstacle to his ideal of self-understanding.",C1
"One of them troubles Leiris: Visiting his sister, he leafs through a collection of old periodicals and comes across a picture of the singer Lucy Arbell in the role of Persephone, wearing large disc-shaped metal ornaments over her ears (Scraps 13).",B2
"As in a successful psychoanalysis, the autobiography turns from a search for certainty to an acknowledgement of complexity.",B2
How can one uncover what one does not know?,B1
"Leiris’s attempt to find out when he became aware of his death seems to be a displacement of a more significant difficulty, namely, his death pure and simple.",B2
"Surely, looking for one central event that escapes him while saving the more general structure of the intelligibility of his text and the transparency of the self, is a much better choice.",C2
There is a fundamental ambivalence in The Rules of the Game between the tendency in writing and thought to dispersion and the attraction exerted by the lacuna or the fantasmatic plenitude that finding a specific object or event can grant.,C2
"He mentions the existence of various lacunae in his story and in memory, yet quickly converges to discussing one singular and particular lacuna.",C1
"However, the claim of indolence and failure is only a part of the story.",C1
"Art does this, indeed, with the power of imagination and artificiality.",B1
"Hence, there is a fundamental failure in the autobiographical project: it cannot reach completion.",B2
"The metaphor of the dream navel, then, creates and supports a certain structure of meaning and inquiry.",C1
Both Derrida and Weber then undermine the conception of the navel as one center loaded with meaning (even if absent) and point to the plurality and complexity of that center.,C1
The search for one thing can be defensive or at least psychically preferable even if it presupposes failure (never finding).,C1
The two navels Freud describes are actually almost antithetical.,C1
"As for autobiography, the obstacles are also numerous.",B2
Initially he goes with the second model.,A2
"Indeed, after this passage, Leiris begins to tell a story (the memory of his first encounter with death, in the voice of the insect in Viroflay) with all the details, the tension and delays of a good story.",C1
"Faced with the need to recognize a limit to analysis and knowledge, Freud then presents two models for the obstacle to self-knowledge.",B2
"It is as though Leiris creates this empty space, a blank square in his textualintellectual array.",B2
"Resistance accompanies analysis all along, wearing creatively different faces, and is vital to it.",C1
"Was he so foolish, he seems to be asking, as to delude himself that he could fill the Zuiderzee, the vast and inaccessible empty void yawning inside?",C1
"It concerns a barrier to self-knowledge: unlike the more substantial or monumental events around which the narrative is woven, the less weighty ones are innumerable.",C1
"In the attempt to fill the lacuna, Leiris examines, then, how death resonates within him.",B2
"According to Freud, the place within discourse that is not easily given, the place that presents itself as void or forgotten, is precisely the place most abundant in meaning.",C2
"And yet Leiris tends to refer to psychoanalysis negatively throughout his life, perhaps because of a sense that psychoanalysis and autobiography are in conflict, being two parallel routes to self-understanding.",C1
"He realizes that in a certain sense, the effort of reconstruction is illusory, and that he himself is incapable of being fully drawn into such an illusion.",B2
"Once a hole has been discovered, it must be filled.",A2
"It is at some point where this meshwork is particularly close that the dream-wish grows up, like a mushroom out of its mycelium.",B2
"The pendulum quickly swings back to the first model, with Leiris looking again for one, hidden event of cardinal importance, and whose meaning is concise and indispensable for the success of self-understanding.",C1
"Too much meaning can be what impedes dream interpretation, which proceeds by following chains of associative thought.",B2
They were selected to rep- resent both the strengths and weaknesses of the sessions,B1
Consider framing these sessions in a game format where successful group work over multiplesessions might result in a group or groups receiving some special recognition for their collaborative work Students are more engaged when learning is fun.,B2
"Based on comments from students and discussion among the participating faculty, we offer the following recommendations to ensure a successful and effective use of this approach",B1
"During each SGL/A session, vignette structured multiple choice questions (MCQ's) were projected onto a screen visible to each group",B2
"With more than six groups, some groups may not have the opportunity to enter into the intergroup interactions and feel that they were not given the chanceto fully engage in the learning activity",B2
The class as a whole was instructed to NOT look at answers chosen by othergroups and it is important that students adhere to this request.,B1
Sometimes goes a littleslowly,A2
"Students invariably expect that whatever is embedded in a course, particularly what can be viewed as “practice questions ”, should contribute to success on the summative course examination.",C1
A limitation of this work is the limited amount of feedback we were able to obtain from the students.,B1
"When viewed this way, many students would prefer more “doses ”of positive reinforcement than fewer during a particular session.",B1
Members of the group should be encouraged to questions the belief of their group peers in a profes-sional and constructive manner.,B1
"Most students did not comment on this issue; however, a few, as will be noted below, would have preferred thatmore questions would have been discussed",B1
It also encourages me to stay on top of the material so that I can feel I can contribute to my group.,B1
"The weakness was that after attending a few sessions, I realized that the intergroup discussion componentwent for way too long such that we could only get through 8 or 10 questions at the most",B2
They definitely exposed me to the types of questions that would be asked on the exams and were a great way to synthe-size the material learned over the week,B2
"The impetus to move quickly through a pool of questions without discussion frequently arises when the questions, ora series of questions are judged to be too easy; that is, when all groups arrive at the same answer in a short span of time.",C1
We expected and observed that most of the students in each group actively participated in the intra-group discussions aimed at arriving at a consensus answer for each question.,C1
I liked them a lot; make sure the questions at SGLA are not primarily fact based though since those don't need much discussion,B2
Make sure all students are satisfied before moving on to the next question,A2
"Because we divided our students into small groups or “teams ”, we were careful to use the designation SGL/A so as to avoid any confusion with a different approach known as Team Based Learning (TBL).",B2
The question of the adaptability of this learning activity to larger classes is a challenging one.,B2
We also found that all groups were engaged and participated on mul-tiple occasions during the intergroup discussions,B1
Differences of opinion as to the intended group answer were raisedand discussed in a respectful manner even when it appeared that a con- sensus could not be achieved.,B2
"In either case, emotional reactions based on a per- ception of what answer might be the correct one will invariably affect generally negatively, any discussion likely to follow.",B2
"Lastly, given the relative ease with which online data can now be collected in many parts of the world, we would expect political communication research to show an increasing trend toward internationalization in the time period studied.",B2
We also collected data on which specific countries were investigated in the studies analyzed.,B1
"Mediatization describes a process whereby news messages, institutions, and, increasingly, journalists themselves have become central to the conduct and outcome of elections and constitute a dominant influence on the public’s perceptions of candidates and issues.",B2
"In the second decade, the percentage of U.S.-focused studies dropped slightly, to 51.5% (n = 67) of articles analyzed, even as the overall number of research articles increased – from 99 to 130; moreover, the number of other countries in research designs rose to 39 (for a geographic map of countries represented in these studies, see Cristian Vaccari’s article in this forum).",C1
"Authorship trends: Similar to our previous work in this area (Evans & Bucy, 2010), we collected data regarding authorship trends in both journals, such as author gender and academic fields.",B2
"Political communication is a dynamic, interdisciplinary field that has grown in stature and reach in recent decades, becoming more international in scope and orientation while gaining respect in political science as a legitimate area of inquiry.",C1
"Historically, the fields of media and communication have been more reliant on mainline disciplines, whether sociology, psychology, history, economics, or political science, for inspiration and validation than these disciplines have needed communication.",C1
"For Patterson (2002), a longtime critic of the press’s outsized role in politics, the embrace of media values that favor “a persistent need for novelty, and a weakness for personality” places democracy in a precarious position.",B2
"In this essay, we explore the extent to which these disciplinary biases operate in the political communication literature, as exemplified by a longitudinal analysis of the research published in two leading journals in the field: Political Communication and the International Journal of Press/Politics.",B2
"With the insinuation of media into politics as never before, two major shifts can be observed in the practice of politics that should be reflected in the design and conduct of research.",B2
"Not surprisingly, the limited effects model of media influence persisted throughout this period.",B1
"Although the received wisdom about media effects has evolved, and both political scientists and communication scholars have long since acknowledged the inseparability of media and politics, the intellectual assumptions brought into political communication research by the early voting studies continue to shape research agendas and priorities.",C1
Rising levels of distrust toward politicians and political institutions are attributed to these anti-institutional themes and relentlessly negative portrayal of political elites by the press.,B2
"Variables coded for each article were grouped into four different categories following a detailed codebook: authorship trends, international reach, tone toward the media’s role in politics, and whether the studies adopted a media-centric or politics-centric view of the press in politics.",B2
"The study of individualand social-level processes at the media/politics interface has been a core concern of communication research since the founding of the field, but the more traditional discipline of political science has been comparatively slow to embrace media as integral to political theorizing and empirical testing.",C1
All articles were analyzed by a primary coder; while 10% of the sample was double-coded to check the reliability of the categories.,B1
Studies were coded as neutral if they maintained an open or dispassionate stance toward the media’s role in politics.,B2
"While visually it would be intuitive to identify the three main lines shown more clearly after denoising as three different clusters, the algorithm instead considers them as one cluster.",C1
"This is referred to as the dual space-time variation property and it indicates that precoding using arbitrary joint space-time orthogonal basis is not sufficient to ensure interference-free communication, unless these basis remain orthogonal after propagating through the channel.",C2
"If a decision made by an AI healthcare solution leads to a negative outcome for a patient, who should be responsible and liable to prevent it from happening again?",B2
We simulate this process by training neural networks to perform instance segmentation on plotted data.,B2
Our aim is to investigate how predictive processing can aid learning of more effective control policies.,B2
"At each step, an RGBD image of the environment is captured by a Kinect2 sensor and converted into a point cloud given the camera extrinsics and intrinsics.",B2
She decides that this is acceptable and releases the model.,B1
"Open challenges and recommendations are outlined to enable the integration of ethical principles into the design, validation, clinical trials, deployment, monitoring, repair, and retirement of AI-based smart healthcare products.",B2
We take the first step towards presenting the vision of a capability-based framework that both unites existing efforts and sheds light on future opportunities.,C1
"We specifically denoise the image through a median filter, where increasing the size of the filter will eliminate low-density areas and emphasize high-density ones more severely.",C1
"The most commonly used clustering algorithms, such as K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture clustering, and DBSCAN, treat samples as points in a metric (usually Euclidean) space and group together points based on distances to other points or to computed exemplars.",C1
"To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to learn visuomotor skills for real-world sequential manipulation tasks by adaptively proposing simulated tasks in simulation.",C1
"Our experiments on real and synthetic datasets and comparisons to ten classical clustering algorithms show that Visual Clustering achieves clustering results that are in-line with human intuition, which is highlighted by very high adjusted mutual information scores, and does so in a fast computation time that outperforms almost all the rest of the classical algorithms, making it efficient for usage on very large datasets.",C2
"Accordingly, we evaluate the specification for completeness, i.e. whether it captures all required information to implement an XAI system that can create interactive explanation experiences.",B2
Learning long-horizon tasks such as navigation has presented difficult challenges for successfully applying reinforcement learning.,C1
"Visual Clustering achieves a very fast computation time that is almost identical to Gaussian Mixture, which was the fastest classical algorithm among the ones tested, and faster performance than K-Means clustering.",C1
"To achieve task success, the robot needs to sequentially execute these steps: pick up a hook, use it to pull the salt can closer, grasp the can, put it into the container, and finally push the container under the rack.",B2
The problem of detecting a sinusoidal signal with randomly varying frequency has a long history.,B2
Solving real-world sequential manipulation tasks requires robots to have a repertoire of skills applicable to a wide range of circumstances.,B2
"The degree to which we would like to increase the cluster areas is controlled by the size of the max filter, where a larger filter size will result in larger cluster areas.",B2
"The second order statistics of non-stationary channels vary across timefrequency and delay-Doppler (4-dimensions) and therefore, such channels can be represented as atomic channels with 4-dimensional asymmetric coefficients.",C1
"In each task, there exists a feasible planned action to achieve the goal state by interacting with the target objects.",B1
The predicted binary mask by the trained U-Net model contains information on where cluster areas are located.,C1
"In addition, we have developed an algorithm within MCMC for proposing new state paths that are arbitrarily close to the previous path.",C1

"There are legal analysts that say that there will be drastic implications, there are tentacles from this, and they even say that this can impact Brown v. Board — the decision from Brown v. Board.",C1

And what — I ask a rhetorical question: What would you all think?,A2
I told her it means the world to me to be here.,A2
Let me say it again: $1.7 trillion.,A2
"In the past, if they had done the two things that they had done before — one, invest in more refineries and producing more product and/or passing on the rebates to the gas stations that — you know, they sell the oil at a cheaper rate than they have to — than they are selling it now, not taking advantage.",C1
For how long?”  It was a deadly earnest question: “For how long?”,B1
"So there’s a lot of things we can do to affect the things that people need on a monthly basis to reduce their inflation, their cost of living.",B1
"And then another one went on to say — and I’m not going to name them — went on to say, “What would you say, Joe, if, in fact, you went — we went to bed tonight here in — in England, woke up the next morning and found out that thousands of people had stormed the parliament of — of Great Britain — gone down the hall, broken down the doors, two cops ended up dying, a number of people injured, and they tried to stop the co- — the confirmation of an election?”  It’s not the same situation, obviously, as we have.",B2

"And we have far too many of our seniors who are having to make a decision, on the one hand, whether they will fill a prescription for insulin, which a doctor prescribed to save their life, or pay for rent or food.”  And we said, “That’s not right.”  And because you voted, we have now capped insulin at $35 a month for those seniors.",B1
A whole lot would change.,A1
And we’re going to get the lead out of these pipes and service lines which is causing our children to drink toxic water.,B1
"And, by the way, a significant number of those jobs are going to be jobs that pay an average of $126-, $127,000.",B1
But I still understand why they’re hurting right now and so many people are concerned.,B1
And let me say this: Regardless — regardless of what the final tally in these elections show — and there’s still some counting going on — I’m prepared to work with my Republican colleagues.,B2
"And that’s a testament, I think, to the American people.",B2
We just need to remember who the hell we are.,A2
"And that’s the context in which I think that they’re looking at: Are we back to a place where we are going to accept decisions made by the Court, by the Congress, by the government, et cetera?",B2

"And I can tell you this, this can be done.",A1
"As we try to reimagine and reconfigure work and inclusion in the wake of the pandemic, accompaniment is that principled approach that can get us there.",B2
"But one thing I realized that, you know, the one percent is the negativity, but the 99 percent, it's the support from different parts of the world.",B1
"Nature often smoothly, glides, swims or wiggles, without the rattling of rigid parts or the loud rubbing of surfaces.",B1
"So what sometimes happens is that a company would say, ""What is the dirtiest part of our business?",B1
"I didn't know what exactly I had to do, but after seeing Greta Thunberg from Sweden strike, I was really inspired.Yes.",B2
"And so we started to say, let's redesign our entire e-bikes and e-scooters so that if a scooter does break, we can take it apart and reuse many parts of that scooter.",B2
It has taken about 200 years for motors to become what they are today.,A2
"If we're going to live up to our own ideals then we need to do the core of what folks have always done: reduce, reuse and recycle.",B1

We have to rethink what the machine should do and what it should not do.,B1
"Take stakeholder capitalism, this notion that a company is responsible to all its stakeholders and to the environment, and not just its shareholders.",B2
Let’s come together and set the narrative straight.,A2
"And he explained to me that 20 years ago in a specific place, he mentioned in Mitanya that they would expect rains at a specific time.",B2
It never made me realize that it was actually an emergency or something that was happening at that time.,B1
It is clarity of the demands that we are allowed to make of others.,A2
And that tool is moral clarity.,B1
"This meant that students like Samuel Igbo, a 14-year-old violinist from a small town in Texas who dreams of pursuing a career as a concert violinist, could receive personalized musical mentorship from Nikki Naghavi, a prize-winning violinist at the New England Conservatory.",B2
"We started partnering with a portable speaker maker, and we take that battery that today doesn't have enough juice to power somebody on a scooter and we turn it into the battery for the portable speaker, and it extends and it recycles into that life.",B2
So let's reimagine machines to take on forms we have never thought of before and discover places we have never been to before.,B2
"He said kids like me who didn't start playing at an early age, who didn't have access to private teachers and the best resources, who didn't really understand how the classical music industry really operated, generally could not make it as professional musicians.",B2
"But people have talent everywhere, and everybody deserves a chance to grow that talent and share it with the world.",B1
So this is where loss and damage comes in.,A2
