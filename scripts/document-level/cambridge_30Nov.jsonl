Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window. He went on to report that night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work. Inspector Saunders said that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: The history of horse racing From the first history books ever written, it is clear that horse racing has always been an important sport. It started in Central Asia about 4,500 years ago and was a favourite sport in both Greek and Roman times. Modern horse racing began when Arab horses were brought to Europe in the 12th century. At first, races were long and between just two horses, but at the beginning of the 18th century this changed. Races became much shorter and had several horses running against each other. Today, horse racing is watched by more people than any other sport in the USA, except baseball. It is also very popular in other parts of the world.","target_text":"Horse racing is a very old sport.

Three elephants came in with their keepers and stood in front of a large piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. From time to time, the keepers put a new brush full of paint into each elephant's trunk and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe what I was seeing! One picture showed a river, one a tree and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants the bananas we brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the cleverest of these animals live in special centres where visitors can watch them.","target_text":"I went to Thailand with my family.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: No Title Some people have complained about this year's collection, New Writing 3, although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality, for PS6.99, is pretty amazing? Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers, such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. It's a strange fact that the less well-known people seem to have written mainly about food.

There is fine work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are pieces from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Gallery News Easter quiz for children During the Easter holidays young visitors can take part in a quiz on the subject ofSurprises.The free quiz sheets can be picked up from the desk at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be directed to 14 surprising paintings and asked a variety of questions about them. The quiz sheets will be available during normal gallery hours from 25 March until 9 April. New picture The Gallery now has a fine still life by the Dutch 18th century painter Jan van Os. This large picture (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colours on wood. It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery. The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is not unusual for a picture like this to be dated in two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to bloom in their different seasons in order to paint them. This picture was generously given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25. Special exhibition The exhibition 'Painting in Spain during the late 18th century' opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period. Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition. These three artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez, and by two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May. Lecture news The series of lectures arranged to go with the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, LizzieBarker will discuss the work of Melendez, while on 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often 'tell a story' through their pictures.

{"input_text":"simplify to A2: Gallery News Easter quiz for children During the Easter holidays young visitors can take part in a quiz on the subject ofSurprises.The free quiz sheets can be picked up from the desk at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be directed to 14 surprising paintings and asked a variety of questions about them. The quiz sheets will be available during normal gallery hours from 25 March until 9 April. New picture The Gallery now has a fine still life by the Dutch 18th century painter Jan van Os. This large picture (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colours on wood. It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery. The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is not unusual for a picture like this to be dated in two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to bloom in their different seasons in order to paint them. This picture was generously given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25. Special exhibition The exhibition 'Painting in Spain during the late 18th century' opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period. Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition. These three artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez, and by two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May. Lecture news The series of lectures arranged to go with the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, LizzieBarker will discuss the work of Melendez, while on 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often 'tell a story' through their pictures.

Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.","target_text":"Grass is a plant. It is very common.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website Welcome to the website. Here is all you need to know before booking a flight. During the brief Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a full- size passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over the continent of Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not definite yet, but if you make a booking now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the day. Questions These are answers to the most frequently asked questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights. How long is the flight? The average flight is 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, Antarctica experts who have lived on scientific research stations there give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera next to the pilot, which is linked to the video system on board, gives you a pilot's eye view throughout, from take-off to landing. Will I get a seat next to a window? All passengers are given two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, passengers are asked to move to the seat shown on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a next-to-window seat for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or the seat next to a window seat for half of the flight and an end of row seat for the other half of the flight. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up from their seats and move about the plane, allowing everyone to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow these amazing sights to be seen equally well from both sides of the plane. What happens if the weather is bad? We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain looks at the satellite cloud picture on the morning of the flight and selects the direction which promises the clearest views. Will I see penguins and other wildlife? As most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 metres below the plane, we can't see them in any detail.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Free-diving in the Caribbean Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, the sport in which competitors reach extraordinary depths on only one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath, and come back up to the top without help. She had been deeper a year before but on that occasion she swam back up using a balloon. This time, however, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man. A team of fourteen safety divers at different depths watched the dive. Following reports of several serious accidents involving other divers, some people have complained that free-diving is too dangerous a sport, but Tanya doesn't agree, insisting that safety is the most important thing, followed closely by training. Most free-divers concentrate on one or two types of event within the sport, but whatever Tanya is in training for, her practice timetable remains the same. Two thirds of the programme is spent doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart. However, she doesn't run, whether outdoors or on running machines, because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness. When she starts doing practice dives, she generally travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over a four-week period, with a rest day between each diving day. It is essential that she doesn't get tired because that could ruin all the preparation.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: In the 1880s, gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA, Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. This town grew so quickly during 1909 that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the summer months, essential supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat, but in the winter the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to them. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat for both themselves and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: The Albuquerque Balloon Festival Every autumn, the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival, an annual nine-day event. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. There were about a dozen hot-air balloons and they took off from the car park in the middle of Albuquerque. From these small beginnings, the festival has grown steadily. This year at least a thousand balloons from over one third of the countries of the world are expected at its current out-of-town site. What to see The pilots are in radio contact with each other and all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. These are known as 'balloon glows' and are an opportunity to take fantastic photographs. However, you must arrive just after night has fallen or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around among the balloons and chat to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colours, some in the shapes of animals or cartoon characters and, of course, well-known products such as varieties of soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, why not take to the sky yourself by arranging a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering balloon rides?

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: The Ghan Train Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide as far as Alice Springs, but there was often serious flooding on the line making it difficult for trains to pass. A new line was completed a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph and the Ghan is certainly not a high- speed, inter-city train - there are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. Nor does the Ghan aim to provide luxury in the same way that a train like the Orient Express does, although the on-board food is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. It is not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I could see that everyone was really looking forward to the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up the majority of my fellow travellers, were particularly keen to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged nowadays and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset.

Each biosphere contains a different climate zone, showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is amazing to see just how many products that we use every day come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plant are grown here. However cold the weather is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the atmosphere is always damp because of a huge waterfall.

We collect news and write news reports, stories and articles. We send these to leading national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio and websites to be published. The news stories and articles by our members that are accepted by newspapers and TV and radio stations, can all be read or listened to on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three centres around the country where young people can meet other members and get involved in projects, and we intend to open new centres nationwide. Since our news agency started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says: 'I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I sat in a room with a team of young journalists and was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age wasn't important, they were trusted to do the stories on their own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen centre in my city, got some training, then was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen has helped me achieve more than I thought possible.

I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved enormously and I understand my teachers.

That makes me confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops - even during December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10oC, but the Russians said it was mild for the time of year! At least it was warm and cosy in my room.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. In the winter of 1990 the French artist Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night a group of foreign guests decided it would be a good idea to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The following morning the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today it is world famous. As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Anna's new school It's been a very exciting week, as we've just moved into our new school building! It's an amazing place, as the builders have used wood for the whole thing, just like in our old school, but it's also one of the first in my country designed to be really environmentally friendly. The school took months to build, so we saw it all happening. It was really exciting seeing the builders clear the space where it would be, although it also meant that some lovely open land disappeared. And the noise of the building machines was really loud, although the builders often had to stop work because it rained so hard. We all began to think the building would never be finished. We have five classrooms now, which are enormous - much bigger than in our previous school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people in the town when they want to have meetings and so on. There's a nursery too, a lovely dining room, and really big changing rooms which we're looking forward to using as soon as our new sports field is ready. When you come into the school, one of the first things you notice is that there aren't any heaters in the building! Instead, the heat for the school comes from all of us inside it - the children, the teachers and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it holds all the heat inside - and all the sound too, so if we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we're inside a concert hall! Another thing you'll notice is that the school roof has a tree on top of it! It was put there by the builders once they'd finished the roof, because they said it was the custom in Austria, the country where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. It's so big, it can be seen for miles! We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it - for example, at the moment we're putting on a play for parents to come and see, but we still have to walk back to our old school","target_text":"Anna has a new school.

Another thing you'll notice is that the school roof has a tree on top of it! It was put there by the builders once they'd finished the roof, because they said it was the custom in Austria, the country where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to look at it yesterday, and it goes round really fast. It's so big, it can be seen for miles! We took some pictures which we're planning to put on the website. Even though we're already using the school building, there are still some parts to be added to it - for example, at the moment we're putting on a play for parents to come and see, but we still have to walk back to our old school","target_text":"Anna's new school building is very exciting. It is made of wood and is environmentally friendly. It took months to build, and we watched the builders. They cleared the land, which was noisy, and sometimes it rained, so they stopped. We thought it might never finish. Now we have five large classrooms, bigger than in our old school. We share one room with the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms for when the sports field is ready. Inside, there are no heaters because the heat comes from the people and computers. The building holds the heat and sound well, so singing sounds like in a concert hall. The roof has a tree on it, a custom from Austria. Electricity is from a wind turbine on a hill; it spins fast and is very big. We took pictures to put on the website. Some parts are not done yet, like the hall for plays, so we use the old one. We are pleased with the school, and teachers say we will learn more quickly."}

We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but all of us were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially considering everyone was so young.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Norwich Norwich, the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia, has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England. With two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has long been a popular centre for various religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and has recently celebrated its 900th anniversary, while Norwich itself had a year of celebration in 1994 to mark the 800th anniversary of the city receiving a Royal Charter. This allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself independently. Today, in comparison with places like London or Manchester, Norwich is quite small, with a population of around 150,000, but in the 16th century Norwich was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years and got richer and richer, becoming famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year. Nowadays, there are far fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964 the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. With its fast-growing student population and its success as a modern commercial centre (Norwich is the biggest centre for insurance services outside London), the city new has a wide choice of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and a number of arts and leisure centres. There is also a football team, whose colours are green and yellow. The team is known as 'The Canaries', though nobody can be sure why.

Whole families of musicians are not exactly rare. However, it is unusual to come across one that includes not only writers and performers of music, but also an instrument maker. When South Wales schoolteachers John and Hetty Watkins needed to get their ten-year-old son, Paul, a cello to suit his blossoming talents, they baulked at the costs involved.

In East Africa, they are hard to find, just like the animals they film.

Their partnership has produced excellent TV films, like the one on leopards, and they are now filming jackals. This is common for TV teams who travel globally. Newman mentioned they have occasional arguments but resolve them quickly, and neither acts as the leader because they share similar views on animals. They use a fixed camp, prepare tea in advance, and rely on pre-packed meals during long trips. Living roughly in remote areas allows them to get close to animals, as when a lioness greeted their car.

When he first complained of an aching head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, had tried to persuade him to go to the doctor. Convinced that the police force could not do without him, he had, as usual, ignored her and attempted to carry on working. Predictably, though he wouldn't have listened to anyone who tried to tell him so, this had the effect of fogging his memory and shortening his temper. It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took the initiative and drove him to the doctor's door that he finally gave in. By that time, he didn't have the strength left to argue with her. In no time at all, she was taking him along to the chemist's to get his prescribed antibiotics and then home to his unsurprised wife who sent him straight to bed. When Molly told him, on the Thursday morning, that the walnut tree had been brought down during the night, Pelham hadn't been able to take it in. On Thursday evening, he had asked weakly about damage to the house, groaned thankfully when he heard there was none, and pulled the sheets over his head. It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics took effect, his temperature dropped and he got up, that he realised with a shock that the loss of the walnut tree had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The Pelhams' large house stood in a sizeable garden. It had not come cheap, but even so Pelham","target_text":"During the severe storms in March, numerous trees in the Brackham area were brought down, including two great lime trees from the former market square. This altered the town centre's appearance entirely, annoying its more conservative inhabitants. Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police, would typically have been among the annoyed, but at the storm's peak, when the wind toppled the mature walnut tree in his garden, he was too ill with bronchitis to notice. Initially, he complained of head and chest pains, and his wife Molly tried to persuade him to see a doctor. Convinced the police force could not manage without him, he ignored her and continued working, which fogged his memory and shortened his temper. Eventually, Sergeant Lloyd took the initiative and drove him to the doctor, where he received antibiotics. After returning home, Molly sent him straight to bed. When he learned about the fallen walnut tree, he was shocked to see the living-room had become cruelly bright, exposing the shabby furniture. The view now featured the neighbor's tall house with unattractive purple bricks and many windows, making Pelham dismayed, but Molly was pleased and insisted they buy a new sofa."}

When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training venue. 'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 'I'm too involved in what I'm doing concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else,' she said.'I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them. These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part. 'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says.

Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes. But you do not have to be a bride to own an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses, given a fresh touch by up-to-the-minute colours and fabrics. For the less adventurous, Ingham's designs include a classic summer navy-blue suit, the centrepiece of the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century.

It was only when she could not find an engagement ring she liked that she decided to design her own. The resulting enquiries encouraged her to set up as a designer in 1990. Now her pieces are sought out by many stars of stage and screen. Her signature style is large semi-precious stones set in gold to make magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings fashioned after those worn in the 18th century. However, she has recently begun to use the most precious stone of all - diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36- year-old Quail.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Confident people what's their secret? Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course. There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place. B Michaela It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself. If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears! C Lisa People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV.

This is why a kingfisher may appear to change from bright blue to rich emerald green with only a slight change in the angle at which light falls on it. It's small wonder that some wildlife photographers get so enthusiastic about them. Couple the colours with the fact that kingfishers, though shy of direct human approach, can be easy to watch from a hideout, and you have a recipe for a lifelong passion. Charlie Jame's first hideout was an old blanket which he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favourite spot. The bird came back within minutes and sat only a metre away. But it took another four years, he reckons, before he got his first decent picture. In the meantime, the European kingfisher had begun to dominate his life. He spent all the time he could","target_text":"The kingfisher is a striking blue-green bird found near streams, where it feeds on fish. Wildlife photographer Charlie James has a deep passion for kingfishers, dating back to his youth. He was so captivated that he often skipped school to observe them, which affected his studies. Despite this, his dedication led to a career in nature photography and filmmaking. He now aims to create a film about kingfishers using only visuals to express their beauty, as words cannot fully capture his connection to these birds."}

Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike. At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel. Though the system cost PS250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers. For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences. Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort.

The public preferred reviewers to focus on one area, so Mark chose film. Without Tom's initiative, this arrangement might not have occurred. Now, he writes an extended weekly piece on one film, which suits him better than reviewing every release, as that would become tedious.

He was in heaven on the Mountain Train, and particularly liked Little Land, with its small replicas of famous buildings that were at his level! The older children enjoyed the ferris wheel, and loved driving the toy cars on a proper road layout. We spent six hours there and were glad that there were places where you could put your feet up. The landscaping is perfect and the staff very helpful and friendly. And there's something for everyone, adults included. Adventure World - The Jeffree family After seven hours we felt there was still a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a fantastic trapeze act and kept us on the edge of our seats. We went on the Terror Line and, although the girls were rather scared and kept their eyes shut most of the time, they said they'd enjoyed it. Their favourite ride was Running River, where you think you're going to get soaked, but you don't. For younger children, Toy Land is great fun. The","target_text":"If you are considering taking children to a theme park in Britain, there are numerous options available. Five families were asked to evaluate some of the top parks. The Burns family visited Fun Island and found it impressive, particularly for younger children who enjoyed attractions like the Crocodile Ride and a dedicated dodgems ride. Older children appreciated more adventurous rides such as Splash Out. While the park was clean, secure, and well-managed, the family noted that the atmosphere and scenery were somewhat lacking. The McMillan family experienced Wonderland for the first time and were delighted. Their young son Oscar adored the Mountain Train and Little Land, while older children enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. The park's excellent landscaping and friendly staff contributed to a pleasant visit. The Jeffree family spent hours at Adventure World, where the children were captivated by the Big Top Circus and rides like Running River. The park is impeccably clean, and the staff were very supportive, even assisting with children on rides. The Langridge family found The Great Park suitable for younger children due to its less intimidating rides. They particularly enjoyed Exotic Travels, though the early closing time at 5 p.m. was a drawback. Lastly, the Break-all family visited Fantasy World, home to Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket. While some staff were less welcoming, the children had a thrilling time on various rides, and a full day was necessary to fully experience the park."}

{"input_text":"simplify to B1: Miss Rita Cohen, a tiny, pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be some six years older, came to his facto1y one day. She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes, and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She was so tiny, so young that he could barely believe that she was at the University of Pennsylvania, doing research into the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. Three or four times a year someone either phoned Seymour or wrote to him to ask permission to see his factory, and occasionally he would assist a student by answering questions over the phone or, if the student struck him as especially serious, by offering a brief tour. Rita Cohen was nearly as small, he thought, as the children from Marie's third-year class, who'd been brought the 50 kilometres from their rural schoolhouse one day, all those years ago, so that Marie's daddy could show them how he made gloves, show them especially Marie's favourite spot, the laying-off table, where, at the end of the process, the men shaped and pressed each and every glove by pulling it carefully down over steam-heated brass hands. The hands were dangerously hot and they were shiny and they stuck straight up from the table in a row, thin-looking, like hands that had been flattened. As a little girl, Marie was captivated by their strangeness and called them the 'pancake hands'. He heard Rita asking, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'How many? Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She continued taking notes as she asked, 'They come direct to your shipping department?' He liked finding that she was interested in eve1y last detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material and they make it into the right kind of weather for us to work with.

This increase is due to better nutrition, which is helping humans return to the height of our Cro-Magnon ancestors from 40,000 years ago. Historically, hunter-gatherers had diverse diets with many plants, but the shift to agriculture led to reliance on just a few crops like wheat and rice, causing poor health and reduced height. Although agriculture supported more people, it resulted in widespread malnutrition. Today, improved diets in wealthy nations are reversing this trend, but taller stature brings challenges such as inadequate bed sizes and limited legroom in transport. Scientists predict that average height may peak around 193 cm this century, but global warming could cause humans to become smaller over time."}

My son, Gary, was given his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I rushed over to look at the place. It was in a really bad state. It was perfect for what I had in mind. Coming into this business made me recall my childhood. I can remember my mother going out to work in a factory and me being so upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We want time for family life.' My wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived over the restaurant in those days, and we always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. It's paid dividends with our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. Also, from a very early age they would come down and talk to our regular customers. It's given both of them a great start in life. Gary was quite a lively child when he was really small. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven he thought he'd jump into it like a swimming pool, and he knocked himself out. When he was older he had to work for pocket money. He started off doing odd jobs and by the age of about ten he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had loads of money at school. He had discipline. He used to be up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out. Gary wasn't very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. By the age of 15 he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair.

Entering the business reminded him of his childhood, when his mother worked in a factory and he felt distressed from being left alone. With this in mind, John prioritized family time. His wife dedicated herself to childcare and accounting, while he ran the business. They resided above the restaurant and stressed the importance of shared meals, which benefited their children, Gary and Joe, making them confident. From an early age, they interacted with regular customers, providing a solid foundation. Gary was an energetic child; at about seven, he attempted to jump into a corner bath like a swimming pool and knocked himself unconscious. To earn pocket money, he began with odd jobs and by age ten worked in the kitchen every weekend, accumulating substantial money and demonstrating discipline by rising early. John appreciated Gary's involvement in the family enterprise. Although Gary was not academically inclined, he thrived in the kitchen. By 15, he matched the adult workers in skill and was occasionally left in charge, producing over a hundred meals, confirming his catering flair. When Gary required work experience for school, John arranged for him to work at a friend's restaurant. Lately, Gary has taken up drumming and formed a band. John cautioned that pursuing multiple interests might lead to failure, advising Gary to concentrate on one path and achieve success by age 30.

While TV ads cannot directly tell children to ask parents to buy products, their goal is the same. Some parents manage by educating their children critically about ads, reducing conflicts. However, many admit to inconsistency, buying indulgent items for themselves while refusing similar treats for their children.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m: to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left","target_text":"Sarah works in France. She is a chalet girl. She makes food and cleans for people on holiday.

{"input_text":"simplify to A2: Keeping the holiday-makers happy A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m: to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says.

At best you will have to put up with wearing the clothes you stand up in for hours or days, until the airline reunites you with your luggage.

At Easter, British people spend over PS230 million on chocolate. A massive eight per cent of all chocolate is bought at this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more of the cocoa-based foodstuffs. Although the large-scale industrial production of chocolate began in the last century, the cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec and Mayan civilisations of Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant which is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is melon-sized and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried they become cacao beans, which can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also used them to make a drink called xocoatl. This is from the word in the Aztec language, Nahuatl, meaning 'bitter water'. In Aztec times the chocolate drink was flavoured with spices and used on ceremonial occasions and for welcoming visitors. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe did not spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the chocolate drink was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten of the Netherlands invented chocolate powder. This was made by extracting most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to produce a solid block that you could eat. A Swiss company then introduced milk solids to the process which gave us milk chocolate. At the turn of the century, the British chocolate market was dominated by French companies.

A group says dolphins need help. Dolphins are smart and friendly. They make us think of the free sea. TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest show happy dolphins. But real dolphins live in dirty seas with less fish. Many dolphins have died. For example, in the North Sea, one type of dolphin lost many animals. You might think laws protect dolphins, but they do not. This could be a big problem for wildlife. There are many kinds of dolphins. In Europe, some dolphins live far in the sea and are hard to see. Others, like bottlenose dolphins, used to be near the coast. Now, they are only in a few places in Scotland and Wales. The dolphins there have hurt skin, which shows they are stressed. It is hard to know why dolphins are fewer. Fishing takes many fish, so dolphins have less to eat. Dolphins can get stuck in fishing nets and die. We see dead dolphins on beaches with net marks. Also, bad things in the sea, like poison from pesticides, can get into dolphins' bodies. This poison can go into mother's milk and kill baby dolphins. Noise from ships and oil wells is loud in the sea. This noise might bother dolphins, but we do not know how."}

Now, bottlenose dolphins are only found in places like Scotland's Moray Firth and Wales' Cardigan Bay, and they show skin injuries from stress. The reasons for their decline are complex. Overfishing reduces fish stocks, threatening dolphins' food supply. Dolphins can get caught in fishing nets, which are hard for them to see, leading to many deaths, as seen on beaches in France and Cornwall. Pollutants like pesticides accumulate in dolphins' bodies and can be passed to calves through milk, sometimes causing death. Additionally, noise pollution from ships and oil rigs travels well in water and may disturb dolphins in unknown ways."}

Globally, there are forty recognised dolphin species. In northern European waters, the most numerous are striped, common, and bottlenose dolphins, along with the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two species typically inhabit the open ocean and are seldom observed, whereas bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were historically common along European coastlines. Nowadays, resident bottlenose populations are confined to areas like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, with skin injuries on remaining individuals indicating stress. The decline in numbers has complex causes. Overfishing, which severely depletes fish stocks and endangers local fisheries, also threatens dolphins by reducing their food availability. Dolphins are at risk of entanglement in fishing nets, which are believed to be undetectable to them; this has led to numerous strandings of dead dolphins with net-related injuries on French and Cornish shores. Furthermore, contaminants such as pesticides, which are fat-soluble, accumulate in dolphins' tissues and can be transferred to offspring via milk, with documented cases of fatal poisoning. Human disturbance, particularly noise pollution from vessels and oil installations, is another concern, as sound travels efficiently underwater and may disrupt dolphin behaviour in ways not fully understood."}

On the blast of the whistle, the crowd roared and the kites rose into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had registered for the competition, which runs for five days every year. Each had entered four different designs which were to be judged on decoration, stability in the air and flying efficiency. 'Flying kites isn't so difficult,' said Adnan, 'but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home and I'll show you how it's done.' The invitation was one of five I'd received that day, and I decided to accept. Back in his house I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large polished room. As dusk fell, he told me to come again the next day to start rebuilding his kite but my plans didn't allow it. Instead I explored the southern half of the state, pointing my car inland on the road to Kuala Lumpur, into granite mountains dripping with luxuriant rainforest. I took a wrong turning and the smooth road ended suddenly at a river. A needle-shaped boat was waiting to ferry pedestrians across. Near it, a small sign caught my eye. It pointed up a footpath into","target_text":"Paul Forster attends a kite festival in Malaysia and gives a damaged kite to Adnan Ali. Adnan insists Paul keep it, explaining it's a custom when a kite line breaks. They sit under coniferous trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, observing the large festival. On the beach, competitors on platforms launch kites that soar into the air after a whistle. Over 500 participants enter kites judged on decoration, stability, and flying efficiency. Adnan notes that kite-making requires skill and invites Paul to his home, where Paul enjoys cold milky tea and fish crackers. Paul declines a follow-up invitation to repair the kite and instead explores southern Kelantan, driving inland towards Kuala Lumpur. He mistakenly turns onto a road that ends at a river, where a boat ferries people across. Noticing a sign for Jelawang Jungle, he hikes a challenging uphill path and meets Baba, who manages a tented kitchen and bamboo huts. Paul stays overnight in a hut, enduring a pitch-black night filled with sounds from wildlife and a waterfall. The next morning offers a stunning view of mountain ranges, but afternoon rain brings wind and lightning, soaking Paul as he descends. He fears for his car's safety but finds it mud-covered yet intact. Back in Kota Bahru, locals ask him personal questions in a friendly manner, leaving Paul with strong memories of human kindness in Kelantan."}

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Father and son start Gold Rush Terence and Chris Madden have travelled from Canada's frozen north to the heat of Africa in their search for nature's most desired metals. The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced that they are just metres away from a five million dollar vein of gold. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to get a few more metres to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. Their search began after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town of the same name. While reading 19th century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the most promising area of land to study. Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish.

Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started turning the heads of the inhabitants as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects, the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity. Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which tends to concentrate on the essential subjects - English, maths, basic sciences and languages - although provision can be made for students who wish to study a wider range of subjects. All five British specialist schools are independent, classes are small by normal school standards, with a high teacher\/pupil ratio. Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders, leaving home to live, eat and sleep full-time at school. This means they spend their formative years in the company of others with similar aims and interests. What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is the cost; the fees are high (PS12,000-PS17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance, to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, specially at a very early age. Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined","target_text":"Some children are very good at music. It can be hard for parents to know how to help them. Sometimes, parents do not see that their child needs help. This can make the child unhappy. Most schools help children who are good at school subjects. But schools may not help children who are good at music. Special music schools can help these children. There are five special music schools in Britain. They are for children aged 7 to 18. The schools help children learn music with teachers who are musicians. Children at these schools spend a lot of time on music. They have lessons, play in groups, and practice. They also learn some school subjects like English and math. The classes are small. Most children live at the school. This means they are with other children who like music. But these schools cost a lot of money. The schools can give money to help some parents. Also, some parents do not want their young children to live at school. The schools watch the children to help them. Some children feel stressed. Their music skill may go away when they are older. Children at these schools learn a lot of music, but they do not learn many school subjects. This can be a problem for smart children. It might be better to wait until the child is older to go to a special music school. Some children can do well in a normal school with good music classes. They can also take music lessons on Saturdays. But this is not easy for families who live far from big cities."}

Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory.

Sometimes, parents do not notice the child's needs, which can lead to frustration and bad behavior. Most schools are good with children who excel in academic subjects, but they may not understand musically gifted children. Specialist music schools can provide the right environment for these children. In Britain, there are five such schools, which are fairly new. They offer a supportive place for gifted children aged 7 to 18 to develop their skills with professional musicians. At these schools, children spend much of their day on musical activities like individual lessons, orchestras, and practice.

Most children are boarders, living full-time at school with others who share their interests. However, there are disadvantages. The fees are high, but scholarships can help. Some parents do not want to send young children to boarding school. School leaders worry about admitting very young children into a strict environment, but they aim to create well-rounded individuals. Separating gifted children early can cause stress, and musical talent might fade in teenage years. The schools monitor progress and offer support. Former students often value the music teaching but regret the limited academic program, which can frustrate intelligent children. It may be better to wait until the child can decide. Alternatively, gifted children might thrive in a normal school with a strong music department or with weekend music training, though this is not feasible for those living far from cities."}

While most schools are equipped to support academically gifted students, they often lack the specialized understanding required for musically talented children, especially in institutions where music is not a priority. Specialist music schools offer an alternative, providing an environment where gifted children aged 7 to 18 can fully develop their abilities under professional guidance. In Britain, there are five such schools, which are relatively recent establishments. Students devote a significant portion of their day to musical pursuits, including individual instrument lessons, ensemble participation, and practice sessions, while also following a condensed academic curriculum focused on core subjects. These independent schools feature small classes and high teacher-student ratios, with most pupils boarding to immerse themselves in a community of like-minded peers. Drawbacks include high costs, though financial aid is available, and reservations from some parents about boarding, particularly for young children. School directors acknowledge concerns about the intensity for early ages but emphasize their goal of fostering well-balanced individuals. Early separation can induce stress, and talent may diminish during adolescence, but schools closely monitor students and provide assistance. Alumni often appreciate the high-quality music education but criticize the limited academic offerings, which may not meet the needs of intellectually gifted students. Therefore, delaying enrollment until the child is older could be advisable. Other options include attending schools with excellent music departments or combining regular education with training at music college junior departments, though accessibility is an issue for those in remote areas."}

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. [line 6: end] The mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer and worship, is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti. Jean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, 'People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.' He describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs. 'When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture: he said. 'The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.'

{"input_text":"simplify to A2: Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed.

'When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture: he said.

Kendra is aware that England has always defeated them, but she finds Barbados exciting to play due to their considerable ability. England is ranked fourth globally, but Kendra notes that the World Championships are challenging because players must push themselves daily with no rest between games, unlike in a series where a loss in the first game does not eliminate the chance of winning. In the Championships, there is only one opportunity, so readiness is essential. Over her 15 years at the top level, netball has intensified, becoming faster and more aggressive on court. Kendra asserts that training is aimed at winning, yet after the final whistle, players become friendlier.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Interview Tips First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words. Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.' Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficulties,studio audiences are just another common feature of television life,and yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows, for example, we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? Of all the audiences for live entertainment, the studio variety is widely considered to be the lowest of the low. I have heard it said that even people who work in television treat studio audiences with scorn - or, as one cameraman put it,'like cattle'. I had assumed that studio audiences were made up of silly people desperate for two seconds of fame. But there's no such thing as a typical studio audience. They come from all classes, professions and income groups. Television tries to attract different types of people for different types of programme. Those of us who prefer to watch television from home can't see why anyone would want to watch television from a studio. Why would anyone bother to apply for tickets, travel long distances, and suffer hours of boredom in the discomfort of a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One theory is that people hope that for a second they might appear on television. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela: 'Why had she come?' It was a chance to appear on television.' Another theory is that people are curious to take a look behind the scenes. But the most common explanation I heard was simply a case of 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Few of us have ever sat in a studio audience, yet we think we can imagine what it is like. You sit there, squashed among strangers, while someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means. As one studio manager puts it, 'We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' But is there any real difference between what you experience in a studio and what you see on your television at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte liked the feeling of involvement with live television","target_text":"Studio Audiences. What is it like to be in the audience for a TV show? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are common on TV, but many people do not know about them. For example, on game shows, we see them get excited. We ask, who are these people? People think studio audiences are not very good. I heard that TV workers do not like them. One cameraman said they are like animals. I thought studio audiences were silly people who want to be famous. But there is no one type of studio audience. They come from all jobs and money groups. TV tries to get different people for different shows. People at home watch TV and do not understand why others go to a studio. Why travel far and sit for hours to watch what you can see at home? One idea is that people want to be on TV. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said she came for a chance to be on TV. Another idea is that people want to see behind the scenes. But most people said a friend gave them a ticket. Few people have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit with strangers, and someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH. You clap or laugh. This happens on some TV, but not all. A studio manager said, 'We think the show is good and does not need signs.' But is watching in a studio different from watching at home? For Claire, it is more exciting. Charlotte liked feeling part of live TV. She said, 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. At home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing the actors live. From my seat, I only saw the back of a head. The start of the show was far away, so I watched it on a screen. Going to a studio may be bad for watching TV, but that is not important. For most people, it was fun and a free night out."}

I did not believe this until I spoke with Angela, who said she came for the chance to be on television. Another theory is that people are curious to see behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was that a friend gave them a ticket. Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we imagine we know what it is like. You sit squeezed among strangers, and someone holds up signs saying APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond. This may be true for some TV shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, 'We assume the show will be good enough without these signs.' But is there a real difference between the studio experience and watching at home? For Claire, being in the studio is more exciting, while Charlotte enjoyed the involvement with live TV. She mentioned, 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. Watching him at home, you miss a lot.' I missed seeing the actors live; from my seat, I could only see the back of someone's head. The opening scenes were filmed far away, so I ended up watching on a monitor. Going to a studio might be a poor way to watch television, but that is not the point. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free evening of entertainment."}
{"input_text":"simplify to B1: Studio Audiences What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Like technical difficulties,studio audiences are just another common feature of television life,and yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows, for example, we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? Of all the audiences for live entertainment, the studio variety is widely considered to be the lowest of the low. I have heard it said that even people who work in television treat studio audiences with scorn - or, as one cameraman put it,'like cattle'. I had assumed that studio audiences were made up of silly people desperate for two seconds of fame. But there's no such thing as a typical studio audience. They come from all classes, professions and income groups. Television tries to attract different types of people for different types of programme. Those of us who prefer to watch television from home can't see why anyone would want to watch television from a studio. Why would anyone bother to apply for tickets, travel long distances, and suffer hours of boredom in the discomfort of a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One theory is that people hope that for a second they might appear on television. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela: 'Why had she come?' It was a chance to appear on television.' Another theory is that people are curious to take a look behind the scenes. But the most common explanation I heard was simply a case of 'a friend gave me a ticket'. Few of us have ever sat in a studio audience, yet we think we can imagine what it is like. You sit there, squashed among strangers, while someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means. As one studio manager puts it, 'We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' But is there any real difference between what you experience in a studio and what you see on your television at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte liked the feeling of involvement with live television","target_text":"Studio Audiences. What is it like to be part of the audience during the filming of a television program? Cosmo Landesman discovered the answer. Studio audiences are a common aspect of television production, yet they remain mysterious to many. For example, when we observe them becoming enthusiastic on game shows, we question who these individuals are. Among audiences for live entertainment, studio audiences are generally regarded as the least esteemed. I have heard that even television professionals treat them with disdain; one cameraman described them as 'like cattle.' I had presumed that studio audiences consisted of naive people desperate for brief fame. However, there is no such thing as a typical studio audience; they come from diverse classes, professions, and income brackets. Television producers attempt to draw different kinds of people for various types of programs. Those of us who prefer watching television from home cannot comprehend why anyone would choose to view it from a studio. Why would someone go through the trouble of applying for tickets, traveling long distances, and enduring hours of tedium in an uncomfortable studio to watch what they can see at home? One explanation is that people hope to appear on television momentarily. I was skeptical until I conversed with Angela, who stated her reason was the opportunity to be on TV. Another theory is that individuals are curious to glimpse behind the scenes. But the most frequent reason I encountered was simply that a friend had provided a ticket. Few of us have ever been in a studio audience, yet we believe we can imagine the experience: sitting cramped among strangers while someone displays cards instructing APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you comply. This may reflect the reality of some television, but certainly not all. As one studio manager expressed, 'We always assume a show will be sufficiently good not to require these signals.' But is there any genuine difference between the studio experience and home viewing? For Claire, being in the studio is more thrilling, while Charlotte appreciated the sense of involvement with live television, noting, 'Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him on TV at home, you miss out on a lot.' Personally, I missed the sight of live actors; from my position, I could only see the back of someone's head.

Travel excitement comes from seeing a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city does not exist until you arrive and see it with your own eyes. Only by seeing Europe, observing changing landscapes and different lifestyles, can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows about Europe, but it means nothing until you see it yourself.

My mind was exhausted from dealing with unfamiliar timetables, currencies, and languages. Upon returning home, I declared, 'Never again,' yet I repeated those exact words in the subsequent years. Being under twenty-five, all I needed was a single train ticket to travel anywhere in Europe for an entire month. Ordinary beds lose their appeal once you've adapted to sleeping in a train corridor, lulled by the rhythmic motion. Transporting all belongings in a rucksack fosters a minimalist approach to travel and promotes considerable wastefulness, such as discarding overly anti-social socks and books after use. Conversely, this perspective aligns perfectly with the Inter-Rail ethos, where practicality and logic are often abandoned. Possessing that ticket instills a carefree mindset. Any framework enabling young individuals to traverse multiple nations rapidly is undoubtedly remarkable. Initially, my companions and I underestimated the ticket's possibilities, viewing it merely as an affordable means to access our selected campsite in southern France. However, the allure of continuous journeying proved irresistible, with always another nation beckoning just beyond the border at no extra expense. We retained some interest in culture, but as our first independent holiday, we prioritized immediate, accessible attractions over comprehensive sightseeing. I derived satisfaction from often only bothering to observe the station's vista. Our goal was simply to manage and enjoy ourselves, mirroring most fellow Inter-Railers with whom we shared resources and experiences. The thrill of travel stems from the abrupt actualization of previously abstract locations; it's as if cities materialize only upon arrival, witnessed through weary eyes. Authentic comprehension of Europe necessitates firsthand observation of its diverse landscapes and lifestyles, rendering others' holiday imagery dull by comparison. Although such journeys may not unveil global novelties, they offer invaluable personal growth, highlighting Europe's immensity—a realization that, in our instance, was not immediate."}

{"input_text":"simplify to B1: Dedicated to their sports Four young sports stars talk about their lives. A Darius (runner) I've always been sporty. I played a bit of everything at one time, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial for a professional football club, but eventually I opted to go down the athletics route instead. My biggest moment came when I got to compete for my country in the youth team and got a medal. It didn't result in much media attention, though, which was a shame. I'd been hoping some sponsorship would come out of it, because the training doesn't come cheap. I train at home all winter and then go away for three weeks, usually Florida, before the season starts. It's good fun - there are great athletics facilities there and the nightlife's great too. You've got to be really disciplined, though. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication pays in this sport. The main goal for me is to get to the next Olympics -that would be fantastic. B Gabriel (surfer) The surfing community is small, so you get to meet the same guys wherever you compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn, so if you're really going to get anywhere, you have to cut out late-night parties altogether. I don't mind that so much, but I do love having a lie-in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it,because without that kind of dedication I might not have won the National Championships last year. I make sure that a big night out follows any win, though, and if there's cash involved in the winnings, I'll go away somewhere really nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning that championship meant I got picked to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now. C Dieter (yacht racer) With five lads on a boat together, you have a good laugh. We're very traditional and we always celebrate a win in great style. It's been said that we act a bit childish","target_text":"Four young sports stars discuss their lives. A: Darius, a runner, was always sporty and excelled in football and athletics. At age 14, he had a trial for a professional football club but decided to pursue athletics. His biggest achievement was representing his country in the youth team and earning a medal, though it attracted little media attention. He had hoped for sponsorship to cover training costs. Darius trains at home during winter and spends three weeks in Florida before the season, enjoying the facilities and nightlife, but he must remain disciplined, often declining social invitations before training. His main ambition is to compete in the next Olympics. B: Gabriel, a surfer, notes that the surfing community is tight-knit, so he encounters the same competitors. Professional surfers are dedicated, often surfing at dawn, requiring him to avoid late-night parties. He misses sleeping in but believes the dedication paid off when he won the National Championships last year. After victories, he celebrates with a big night out and may travel if there is prize money. Winning the championship led to him presenting a surfing series on TV, making him somewhat of a celebrity. C: Dieter, a yacht racer, enjoys the camaraderie with four teammates on the boat and their traditional celebrations after wins. He feels that reporters focus more on their social activities than race results. Dieter is away for eight months annually and values time with friends from different backgrounds to avoid being consumed by the sport. He is recognized within sailing circles but rarely in public, which he prefers. He receives requests for signed photos and ensures he replies to every letter, despite the effort. D: Tomas, a tennis player, appreciates crowd support during matches and the thrill of being recognized by fans, though it can be overwhelming. His previous relationship ended partly due to attention from female fans and his frequent travel for tournaments. He acknowledges the need for sacrifices in sports and is content to focus on his career now, planning to pursue other interests after an early retirement."}

Annika Reeder, aged 15, secured a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She aspires to work as a physiotherapist and participate in the upcoming Olympics. Her current routine is extremely demanding, leaving no time for television or socializing with friends. She approaches training day by day; when exhausted, her coach might grant her a day off, but she generally persists to avoid stiffness. Annika's mother observes that Annika demonstrated significant potential from a young age. She emphasizes that parental pressure is ineffective, and success requires personal desire. While others comment on the sacrifices made, the mother values what gymnastics has provided, transforming Annika from a shy, thumb-sucking child into a confident individual with global connections. Sarah Stokes started show-jumping at ten and has since won the British National Championship. She appreciates that her parents, who train and transport her in a horse box, share her interest. Events vary in duration, and Sarah never grows tired of them due to her enthusiasm and determination. She would pursue show-jumping independently if necessary and is motivated by personal goals, including qualifying for the British young riders team and earning an Olympic gold medal. Sarah's mother notes Sarah's instant passion for horses from age one, with early morning exercises at five. To qualify for major shows, they travel extensively across England, economizing by sleeping in the horse box. She describes Sarah as well-organized and content on horseback, finding immense satisfaction in her child's achievements. Jane McShane, ten years old, holds the title of Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. She enjoys the social atmosphere of tournaments but admits to a lack of concentration during games, often gazing around instead of strategizing. She avoids arrogance by not discussing her successes at school to prevent embarrassment. Jane's mother recounts Jane's introduction to chess at five by her grandfather; unlike her own childhood boredom, Jane was immediately captivated, memorizing moves quickly and defeating adults by six. She supports Jane's choices, feeling proud of her wins but unwilling to impose continued participation, believing in nurturing her daughter's exceptional talent to its full potential."}

At the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham's National Indoor Arena, spectators watch intently as French climber Francois Lombard dangles upside down high on the climbing wall. This venue is more renowned for hosting the TV program Gladiators, yet both events share the use of The Wall, enabled by advancing technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers honed their skills on natural cliffs with ample climbing angles, and in winter, they either endured the cold, opted for walking, or engaged in snow and ice climbing in Scotland. As the sport evolved, maintaining fitness became crucial for elite climbers. When cliffs were inaccessible, they utilized brick edges or stone structures for training to strengthen their fingers and combat monotony. Consequently, many sports centers began constructing dedicated climbing walls with specially edged bricks. A key influence was Don Robinson, a physical education teacher who built a climbing wall at Leeds University in the mid-1960s by embedding natural rock in concrete. Numerous walls of this type were erected across the country in the 1970s, but they had limitations: they were exclusively vertical, lacking features like overhangs and angled slabs found on real cliffs, and their static design led to repetitiveness that bored climbers over time. In 1985, French inventor Francois Savigny developed a mouldable material that mimicked cliff holds, allowing for removable attachments on walls. Additionally, French manufacturers experimented with steel-framed panels, overcoming the weight issues of concrete and enabling freestanding, adjustable structures with interchangeable fixtures for endless climbing variations."}

{"input_text":"simplify to B1: In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees from the woods were turned into boards for construction work, there was an old brick building two floors high, and all around the outside walls were heaped great piles of soft sawdust. There were many of these golden mountains of dust covering that part of the yard right down to the blue lake. That afternoon, bored with having nothing else to do, all the fellows followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building and they sat with their legs hanging over the edge looking out across the lake. Suddenly Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and without thinking about it, he pushed himself off the roof and fell on the sawdust where he lay rolling around and laughing. 'I dare you all!' he shouted. 'You're all cowards,' he said, encouraging them to follow him. Still laughing, he watched them looking down from the roof, white-faced and hesitant, and then one by one they jumped and got up grinning with relief. In the hot afternoon sunlight they all lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes till at last one of the fellows said, 'Come on up on the old roof again and jump down.'There wasn't much enthusiasm among them, but they all went up to the roof again and began to jump off in a determimed desperate way till only Michael was left and the others were all down below grinning up at him calling, 'Come on, Mike. What's the matter with you?' Michael wanted to jump down there and be with them, but he remained on the edge of the roof, wetting his lips, with a silly grin on his face, wondering why it had not seemed such a long drop the first time. For a while they thought he was only fooling them, but then they saw him clenching his fists tight. He was trying to count to ten and then jump, and when that failed, he tried to take a long breath and close his eyes.

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher.

She was then asked to help on another opera the next season. 'I had to take the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous.

But Jo had just arrived in Dublin, so she had no contacts. She had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. Jo felt Dublin was a big, unknown place. She didn't question why she was going there. All her school friends assumed they would leave their small town. Some went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, but Jo was the only one going to Dublin alone. Jo's mother thought the hostel was good because nuns ran it. Her father worried that hostels are often cold. Her sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought Jo was crazy to stay in a hostel.

{"input_text":"simplify to B1: No Title Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had only just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact, nobody to tell you that their bedsit would be vacant at the end of the month. No, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching. For Jo, Dublin was a very big blank spot. She really felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go.

The most effective approach was through personal connections; if you knew someone who was vacating a place, it often worked out. However, Jo had recently arrived in Dublin, so she lacked any such contacts and had to resort to staying in a hostel while searching. For Jo, Dublin represented a vast, unfamiliar territory, and she felt she was stepping into the unknown without questioning her reasons for moving. It was a common expectation among her school peers to leave their provincial town for a more exciting life, with some relocating to places like Ennis or Limerick, but Jo was the sole person from her year heading to Dublin alone. Her mother believed the hostel, run by nuns, was a safe option, her father expressed concerns about the cold, and her sisters, employed as waitresses, thought she was irrational for enduring a week there. Unaware of their ongoing discussions, Jo responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend that promised a private room with a TV and shared kitchen and bathroom, conveniently located near her post office job, and she fervently hoped it would be pleasant and affordable. There was no queue for the flat since it was advertised as needing a third girl rather than a full rental. Although Jo feared it might be too upscale due to the mention of a personal TV, the house appeared ordinary. Upon arriving, she encountered a departing girl who disparaged the place, but Jo proceeded upstairs where Nessa welcomed her and criticized the previous applicant for being condescending. Pauline, with her vibrant punk style, was also present, and after Jo introduced herself, Nessa offered tea and assured her that they would customize a mug if she decided to stay."}

Her first collection was stones from her parents' garden. When she was six, she went to a school in a faraway, cold place. Her parents took her to a museum. She loved the things in the museum.

Catherine the Great of Russia collected many paintings. You do not need to be rich to collect. Amanda collected tulip bulbs and cups. She worked hard to find them. Once, she got a tulip from another collector. She planted it, but someone stole it. She also collected 350 American rag dolls. She looked all over the USA for them. Her house burned down, and the dolls were destroyed. This made her very sad. Amanda is interested in how collections move between people. Things that belonged to famous people are valuable.

If you have only written one story or one","target_text":"Are you trying to get your story published? Margaret Stubbs gives advice. First, research publishers and markets. Read a lot of books and magazines to understand what is popular. Markets change, so update your knowledge. For example, if you write love stories, find magazines that publish them and study their stories. New writers often send work too early. It is better to write many stories first to improve. Do not destroy your work; revise it. Most writers face rejections before success. Join a writing group or course to gain confidence. Practice writing regularly."}
{"input_text":"simplify to B1: Trying to get published? If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need. Readers of this magazine often write in saying, 'I have written this story \/ book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should be researching their markets and finding out about publishers as well as practising their writing skills. Turning words into a saleable commodity takes a good deal of knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. There are several ways of doing this, but the best one is simply by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time. As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated as new publications are constantly appearing - editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always hungry for new blood; as writers we have to make sure we give them what they want. To begin with you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let us say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The very first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, taking special note of who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in catering to their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never actively discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is of publishable standard; so I have to try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint. The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one","target_text":"If you are seeking publication, Margaret Stubbs offers guidance. Begin by researching potential publishers and understanding the market through extensive reading of relevant materials. Since publishing trends evolve with new titles and editorial changes, stay informed. For instance, if you aim to write love stories, identify suitable magazines and analyze their content to grasp reader expectations. Many novice writers submit work prematurely; instead, focus on producing multiple pieces to enhance skills and build confidence. Rejections are common, so persist and consider joining writing groups or courses for support and development."}

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: 'What now?' was my immediate thought, as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago, we've established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box -- a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours. Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented. Three weeks after their arrival, however, I noticed that Willow seemed lethargic, although he was still taking food as normal. It was a warning sign. I should have reacted straightaway; not realising its importance, I awoke the next morning to find him dead.","target_text":"I have a farm. My helper gave me a box.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths occupied a status comparable to physicians and astrologers, as they were the exclusive suppliers of weaponry, armour, and agricultural implements. They have also been lauded as artists; eighteenth-century blacksmiths produced exquisitely baroque ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, while the sinuous metal embellishments characteristic of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture were invariably crafted by talented smiths. Nevertheless, by the late 1960s, practitioners of this ancient skill had verged on extinction in Britain, owing to the decline of heavy industry and the infrequent use of graceful wrought-iron features, such as handrails, in modernist tower block designs. Over the preceding decade, however, a modest resurgence has occurred, fueled by heightened appreciation for ornamental architecture and a more liberal approach to interior aesthetics. Despite this, a considerable portion of contemporary work appears surprisingly trite, with manufacturers of gates and balconies persistently marketing their products as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style,' and ubiquitous trendy design stores cluttered with rusty candlesticks adorned with superfluous appendages. Thankfully, alternatives are emerging, and a series of forthcoming events seeks to advance the blacksmith's craft, commencing with an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, BABA's secretary, posits that we might be at the dawn of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths have shed their limitations; power tools have emancipated smiths from arduous anvil labour, enabling them to manipulate metal—bending, splitting, twisting, and spot-welding—with relative facility.

We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become a friend rather than a father. I don't believe in physical violence. I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me.

The theatre director: Owing to my peculiar personal circumstances, I have been blessed with 35 years of raising young children, and I can truthfully affirm that I have cherished every minute. This morning, I had the pleasure of feeding the infant, which epitomizes the essence of fatherhood for me. I consider myself exceedingly fortunate with my offspring, as we share passions for opera, theatre, literature, and music, fostering a profound connection, particularly now that they are largely grown and I function more as a companion than a paternal figure. I reject physical violence; despite having slapped my children in fits of anger, I do not condone such behavior.

I refrain from pursuing them about lack of communication to avoid burdening them with guilt, a practice my parents imposed on me that I would never replicate. B. The advertising executive: I was relatively young, approximately 25, at the time of my children's births, and I confess that the duties and constraints were rather vexing.

If it was that effortless, why hadn't you ceased years ago?' My inability to elucidate how I transformed from a lifelong, packet-a-day smoker to a non-smoker within a single afternoon was mildly irritating, and I myself find it perplexing. The cessation session, which occurred precisely two months and three weeks prior, was an intriguing blend of group therapy and hypnotherapy. I had not intended to quit and lacked any strong desire to do so. I deeply resented the relentless pressure from anti-smoking advocates—a sentiment I still hold—and, moreover, I had low blood pressure and a heritage of longevity and robust health, rarely coughing or feeling ill and seemingly fending off colds more effectively than friends with consciously healthier habits. On that unremarkable Thursday afternoon, I attended the Birmingham session of 'The Easy Way to Stop Smoking' solely to author an article about others attempting to quit, firmly declaring that I would not partake in cessation efforts as it would be unfair, given my motivation was journalistic rather than personal. I considered myself entirely reasonable, as I derived genuine pleasure from smoking, yet the counsellor regarded me with a knowing expression. Participants were permitted to smoke liberally, resulting in a smoke-filled room that necessitated open windows, but I noted with interest my own reluctance to smoke, a sentiment shared by others. I surmise that the anti-smoking rhetoric resonated intellectually, and just as smoking had become a defiance against opposition, the notion of quitting grew appealing. The prospect of being a non-smoker imbued me with a sense of personal power, a private sentiment unrelated to others.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Tapping into a food supply In the forests of Madagascar there lives a primate with a lifestyle remarkably like a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the primate, the rare and elusive aye-aye, bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae. The woodpecker, of course, uses its beak for chiselling into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey; the aye-aye, on the other hand, uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Though the aye-aye's strange way of feeding was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only now discovered how it locates the insects hidden inside the wood. Dr Carl Erickson, of Duke University's Primate Center, has been investigating the hunting skills of two captive males, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her infant daughter, Annabelle (Animal Behaviour, vol. 41 pp. 793-802). He first tested whether they found insects just by looking for the telltale visual signs of their presence. For example, holes on the surface might indicate sites where female insects had entered the wood and laid their eggs. Dr Erickson presented the aye-ayes with logs in which he had drilled several narrow holes. Some holes led to cavities containing mealworms while others were blank dead-ends. The aye-ayes went straight for the cavities with food, gnawing through the wood and clearly not requiring the visual clues of surface holes. Perhaps the aye-ayes were locating the mealworms by their smell or the sounds they were making. But further tests showed that they didn't use these clues either. Logs in which the smell of the insects was prevented from leaking out presented no problem, and the aye-ayes also located dead (and therefore silent) mealworms. If they weren't seeing, smelling or hearing the insects, how were the aye-ayes able to find them? Dr Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty","target_text":"In Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. It lives in forests. It looks for food like insects in wood. It uses its teeth to make holes. It uses its long finger to get the insects out. Scientists studied the aye-aye. They found it does not use its eyes, nose, or ears to find the insects. Instead, it taps on the wood with its finger. It listens for sounds. This helps it find hollow spaces with insects. The aye-aye is like a woodpecker bird. But in Madagascar, there are no woodpeckers. The aye-aye also eats nuts like a squirrel."}

Instead, they tap on the wood with their finger and listen with their big ears to find hollow spaces where insects are hiding. This is called echo-location. The aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar, where woodpeckers are not found. It also eats nuts, using its teeth and finger like a squirrel."}

Both species bore into wood to access insect larvae; however, the aye-aye employs its incisor teeth for gnawing and its slender third digit for extraction. Dr. Carl Erickson of Duke University's Primate Center conducted studies on captive aye-ayes to elucidate their hunting techniques. His research demonstrated that they do not depend on visual indicators, olfactory signals, or auditory cues from the insects. Rather, they utilize a form of echo-location by tapping the wood with their middle finger and attentively listening with their prominent ears to discern subsurface cavities. This ability allows them to detect both hollow spaces and any movement of insects. While the aye-aye is thought to occupy the ecological niche of woodpeckers in Madagascar, other avian species also engage in similar insect-probing behaviors.

Everyone is enamored with technology, which offers marvelous gadgets that simplify life and provide extra time for other activities. A gradual, though not very subtle, form of brainwashing has led us to believe that technology dominates and that this is acceptable. The implications are clear: using my hands consumes no electricity, and handmade crafts do not harm the environment. However, a recent frustrating experience with my malfunctioning word processor – involving a high call-out fee, labor charges per quarter hour, and additional costs for parts – reinforced my suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or hassle. Are we as reliant on technology as we assume? Gradually, I have allowed household technology to fall into disuse as it reaches the end of its short lifespan. This makes me question what 'time' technology actually affords us. Is it time to engage in more activities that require purchasing additional gadgets? If so, credit to the marketing experts, but I believe they are deceiving us. When the device began making strange noises that persisted even after a confused service agent disconnected it, I abandoned it in the backyard. Now, I sew by hand. I am not bound to a noisy, whirring machine; I can work at my own pace on garments. Moreover, I was always uneasy about electric machines that speed towards one's fingers. Best of all, I can pack everything into a bag and take it with me wherever I go. Certainly, there are gadgets I would not want to live without; a year without a washing machine taught me its value. Yet, losing others has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were too inclined to watch television or play videos, I returned the rented color TV, and we reverted to a small black-and-white portable. It strains the eyes and makes us focus on what is truly worth watching. Consequently, we now spend more time walking the dog (who never liked TV), reading, conversing, or pursuing hobbies. In my case, sewing is one such hobby, and I have given up using my sewing machine. My old Singer now serves as a plant stand, and since I cannot afford a replacement, I have taken to sewing manually."}

It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK. These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment. However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor - a PS48 call-out fee, a labour charge of PS15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.

Society is infatuated with technology, which furnishes us with marvellous gadgets that facilitate life and ostensibly grant us additional leisure time.

We similarly procrastinate in documenting our own experiences for posterity. Hannah Renier has devised a solution by authoring autobiographies for ordinary people, creating hardback books of at least 20,000 words, complete with illustrations if desired. This concept emerged from her familial discussions, where she recognized the gradual erosion of personal history. Her clients, who often lead intriguing lives, derive significant personal satisfaction from the process, aiming to leave a legacy for their children while gaining self-insight. The assurance of privacy helps them overcome self-censorship, leading to candid accounts that may reveal painful events or repetitive behavioral patterns rooted in childhood. Hannah acts as a discreet recorder, not an interrogator, and individuals generally strive for honesty. She views this as a means to preserve roots in an era of rapid change and diminished family cohesion. The books, which involve extensive interviews and careful editing, are of high quality and cost nearly £3,000, with additional copies at £25 each. While she receives numerous inquiries weekly, the expense limits participation largely to a wealthier clientele, contrary to her initial expectations."}

Tools, for example, are utilized by wild chimpanzees, who wield sticks as implements and weapons, and by sea otters, who employ rocks to fracture clamshells. Monkeys exhibit a rudimentary language with specific vocalizations for threats such as leopards, eagles, and snakes.

Unambiguous proof of distinctly human art, manifest in cave paintings, sculptures, and musical instruments, does not appear until roughly 35,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons. Assertions that human art is non-utilitarian, motivated by aesthetic appreciation, and culturally transmitted rather than instinctive are frequently proposed.

The Museum is housed in a purpose-built gallery with excellent natural light. The advantages of plaster casts are many: groups of sculptures originally set up together but now split between various museums all over Europe can be viewed together as originally intended. Nearly all the most celebrated works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in one afternoon. B. Cambridge Darkroom Cambridge Darkroom is a centre for photography with community darkrooms and a gallery showing a varied exhibition of photography and related media. We regularly run courses and workshops for people of all ages and abilities, including our popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course and Master Classes with invited photographers. We have a membership scheme whereby all our members can use our darkrooms. We also encourage young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to develop their skills with our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We stock photographic books and an magazines and carry a full range of photographic materials. C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology The Sedgwick Museum houses a magnificent collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks and minerals of all geological ages, and from all parts of the world. It also houses Britain's oldest intact geological collection, that of Dr John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original early 18th century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was Professor of Geology and keeper of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his long life, he added enormously to the collections, laying the foundations of a truly outstanding museum. The collection is arranged by geological age so that the major changes in life on Earth can be traced through time. The new Whewell Gallery houses the beautiful minerals and gems of the collection. The displays are accompanied by full explanatory labels to explain both their nature and modern use. D.

Women are on a winning streak. Excelling in any sport is challenging, and for women, it can be even tougher. Training and competition take up most of their time, requiring significant sacrifices in their personal lives. Despite this, they are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. In this article, we interview several outstanding British sportswomen. Jill, aged 27, is a skier. She describes the thrill of flying through the air and landing cleanly, though it can be intimidating, especially in poor conditions. With ten months of training each year, she has little opportunity for a career outside skiing and has given up much of her social life, but she accepts this as her choice. The British team includes six men and three women, all competing on equal terms in the same events. Caroline, 22, is a cyclist. She started cycling two years ago by borrowing a bike for a charity race and won unexpectedly. As a professional, she earns well and has potential for endorsements, but she is concerned that people might attribute her success to her appearance rather than her ability. Therefore, she concentrates on her cycling, training over four hours daily along with other exercises. Her boyfriend, also a cyclist, supports her commitment. Annabel, 26, is a rower. She notes that rowing is not widely available in girls' schools, so many start late, hindering international success. Frequent coach changes lead to a lack of continuity, making the women's squad disorganized. Nonetheless, she enjoys the sport for its fitness benefits and social aspects. Ffyona, 24, is a long-distance walker. She dreamed of walking the world as a teenager and found Britain too confining. Her walk across Australia was extremely painful, with long hours, minimal sleep, and numerous blisters, but she achieved a record under time pressure from her sponsorship. She observes that men often perceive women as higher risks for failure in sponsorship. Lisa, 26, races saloon cars. She encounters men with large egos who ignore her when she performs well, and she faces aggressive competition on the track. Being naturally competitive, she persists despite financial struggles, as earnings are reinvested into the sport. Women racers have historically been viewed as eccentrics, but their numbers are growing. Lisa is driven by the pursuit of perfection in each"}

Women on a winning streak. Achieving excellence in any sport is inherently difficult, and for women, the challenges are often doubled. The demands of training and competition leave scant room for a conventional lifestyle, necessitating considerable sacrifices. Nevertheless, these athletes are defying the odds, overcoming prejudice, and shattering records. Here, we engage with a selection of remarkable British sportswomen. Jill, 27, is a skier. She relishes the sensation of soaring through the air and executing a clean landing, though admits it can be daunting, particularly under adverse conditions such as illness or poor visibility. With training occupying ten months annually, pursuing an alternative career is impractical, and she has forgone much of her social life—a choice she consciously made. The British team comprises six men and three women, all competing identically in the same events and receiving equal treatment. Caroline, 22, is a cyclist. Two years prior, she participated in a charity race on a borrowed bike and triumphed by outpacing all competitors, an astonishing feat for a novice. As a professional, she is remunerated handsomely and has substantial endorsement potential. However, she is apprehensive that her success might be attributed to her physical appearance rather than her cycling prowess, prompting her to focus intensely on her sport. Her regimen includes at least four hours of daily cycling supplemented by stretching, swimming, and running. Her boyfriend, also a cyclist, comprehends the extensive time investment required. Annabel, 26, is a rower. She highlights that rowing is inaccessible to many girls due to its scarcity in schools, resulting in a late start that impedes international achievement. Moreover, the frequent turnover of coaches—typically lasting only a year—creates a lack of continuity, rendering the women's squad chaotic. Despite this, she derives pleasure from the activity, values the fitness it affords, and appreciates the vibrant social scene. Ffyona, 24, is a long-distance walker. At age 13, she aspired to circumnavigate the globe, unaware of its vastness, and found Britain too constricting and secure. Now more diplomatic, she reflects on varied"}
{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Sea, Ice & Rock Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock. In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing. It was the first time I'd been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin's skills at climbing. The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.

Traditional Chinese medicine posits that health is maintained through the harmonious flow of Qi, an energy traversing meridians throughout the body; disruptions in this flow can lead to ailments. Practitioners diagnose imbalances by examining pulses, the tongue, and overall condition, followed by the insertion of fine needles at meridian points to restore Qi, occasionally augmented with heat or pressure. With over three hundred primary points, acupuncture may elicit sensations like dull aches, attributed to engaging the Qi. Scientific explanations propose mechanisms such as nerve stimulation blocking pain signals or endorphin release. It is applied to various chronic pains, including back issues, arthritis, and migraines, and in China, it serves as an anesthetic in surgeries, offering advantages like reduced side effects and quicker recovery. Evidence from trials supports its efficacy for 50-80% of individuals, though multiple sessions are often necessary. The holistic methodology of acupuncturists contrasts with conventional Western approaches, emphasizing comprehensive diagnosis. Disparities exist among practitioners regarding adherence to traditional theories versus scientific rationale, underscoring the need for careful selection of qualified acupuncturists."}

The narrator, a lawyer struggling to build a new practice after being forced to leave a high- powered law firm, finds himself manoeuvred into defending his boss's wife when she is tried for her husbands murder. The trial scenes are riveting, with the outcome in doubt right up to the verdict, and a really unexpected twist in the final pages. This is a terrific debut into a crowded genre. BOOK B Curtains for the Cardinal begins with a bang, and plunges the charismatic Sigismondo, troubleshooter for the aristocracy of the Italian Renaissance, into a turmoil of politics, clerical intrigue and high-wodety murder from which we are always confident he will emerge unscathed to disclose the guilty parties. The plot is convoluted and the book is about 50 pages overweight, but it is still great stuff. BOOK C File Under: Deceased introduces a refreshingly different new detective from a first novelist, Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector, ideally positioned, it seems, for a bit of investigating when a strange man falls dead at her feet. Undaunted by attacks from various quarters - perhaps tax inspectors are used to this sort of thing - and the disapproval of her handsome local detective sergeant, gutsy, versatile Leah is a winner in every way. BOOK D Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker sets that most literate of private investigators, Spenser, the job of assisting his friend Hawk to clear drug dealers out of a deprived estate in rundown Boston. The slick dialogue comes almost as fast as the bullets, but there are few corpses and more philosophy than usual. High-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

{"input_text":"simplify to A2: Steve Martin's Compelling Evidence is compelling indeed.

BOOK B: In Curtains for the Cardinal, Sigismondo, a troubleshooter for the aristocracy in Renaissance Italy, is thrown into a world of political intrigue, clerical schemes, and murder. Although the plot is complex and the book is somewhat too long, it remains highly engaging, with confidence that Sigismondo will uncover the culprits.

The land, situated near Auckland, was of poor quality but ideal for afforestation. With prior agricultural work in Australia, Jonathon was immediately keen on the project. From 1968 to 1972, he and his siblings planted 70 acres, enduring persistent rain and cold conditions. Assisted by an expert tree-planter, they used planting bags and meticulous line-setting techniques to ensure straight rows. Jonathon found the strenuous work rewarding, enhancing his physical fitness and allowing for reflective thoughts about nature and human existence.

Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity. These benefits have been borne out by the successes of generations of Kenyan runners. My first African race - which came before my spell at the Kenyan team training camp - was also a first for the whole continent. Held in Nairobi, it was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil. If nothing else, it was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but 3 were Kenyan. And I honestly felt I hadn't had a bad race! However, I don't believe Kenyan success can entirely be put down to the altitude factor. Kenyan runners are also noted for their refreshingly uncomplicated approach to the sport. While their running style is seemingly effortless, their diet simple and their manner of conversation relaxed, they also seem to love competing. But the least discussed aspect of the puzzle of Kenyan success was perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay with the Kenyan runners at their team","target_text":"Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's elite 10,000-meter runners, visited the Kenyan high-altitude training camp in Nanyuki, situated on the slopes of Mount Kenya. During his most recent trip, he departed from tradition by training alongside Kenyan runners on their home ground and participating in his inaugural race in Kenya's oxygen-thin atmosphere. He was invited by the national coach after a World Championship performance. Although altitude training enhances red blood cell production and oxygen transport, evidenced by Kenyan successes, Richard contends that their achievement cannot be solely attributed to this factor. Kenyan athletes are renowned for their effortless running style, simplistic diet, and relaxed demeanor, yet they possess a profound enthusiasm for competition. Residing in spartan dormitories at St Mark's College, the athletes adhered to a rigorous regimen of three daily workouts covering approximately 40 kilometers, with only a slight reduction on Sundays. Richard reflected that the purity of their mountainous existence, combined with demanding training and an ardent drive for victory, fundamentally underpins Kenya's ascendancy in global distance running."}

An image featuring a person is almost invariably more engaging than an identical scene devoid of human interest. However, photographing people proficiently presents considerable difficulties. In addition to technical and artistic considerations, the photographer must remain attentive to actions, gestures, and facial expressions. Often, the mere presence of the camera can detrimentally influence these aspects. When composing group shots, eschew straight-line formations. Instruct participants to assume varied angles and distances, and if feasible, utilize different elevations. Alternatively, arrange for some members to sit or kneel at the forefront to ensure all faces are discernible, or adopt a higher vantage point. In posed photography, subjects frequently exhibit stiffness, resulting in unnatural stances. Alleviate this by assisting them in attaining a comfortable posture, perhaps by proposing they fold their arms or insert hands into pockets. Avoid feigning that you are not photographing someone when it is evident, as this fosters tension and potential hostility. Most individuals will acquiesce to being photographed—possibly after some initial objections—and may even feel complimented, though they might require direction to avoid self-consciousness. A photograph can be compromised if the subject gazes vacantly outside the frame, thereby shifting the focus away. To imbue an image with immediate impact, direct the subject to look into the lens; this establishes a connection with the viewer, irrespective of whether they smile. If maintaining eye contact proves challenging, reiterate the instruction just before capturing the image, or elicit an authentic reaction by uttering something amusing or unexpected. Conversely, for a candid approach, have the subject concentrate on an element within the picture area, facilitating a sense of unobtrusive observation for the viewer. Facial expressions and concomitant gestures are paramount, as they communicate the subject's emotional state more effectively than any other element; for instance, a jovial child elicits smiles, whereas a sorrowful countenance evokes empathy. Seek out recognizable expressions such as shrugs, winks, or clenched fists, which serve as an instantaneous visual lexicon. Although isolated portrait"}

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS? We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said. Publisher A Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The Book Marketing Council found some years ago that when questioned on why they had bought a particular hook, more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence (advertisements, word of mouth, bookshop display, etc.). Authors' responses to reviews are slightly different from publishers. Both are devastated by no reviews, but publishers are usually more equable about the had reviews, judging that column inches are what matter and that a combination of denunciation and ecstatic praise can actually create sales as readers decide to judge for themselves. Publishers probably get the most pleasure from a review which precisely echoes their own response to a book - they are often the first 'reader'. Publisher B While publishers and the press fairly obviously have a common interest in the nature of book review pages, one also needs to remember that their requirements substantially differ: a newspaper or magazine needs to provide its readers with appropriately entertaining material; a publishing house wants to see books, preferably its own, reviewed, preferably favourably. Without any question, book reviewing is 'better' -- more diverse, less elitist -- than 40 years ago, when I began reading review pages. That said, there is still a long-grumbled-about tendency to neglect the book medium read by a majority -- namely paperbacks. The weekly roundups aren't really adequate even if conscientiously done. And even original paperbacks only rarely receive serious coverage. But publishers shouldn't complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews, which after all are an economical way of getting a book and an author known. There is no question that a lively account of a new book by a trusted name can generate sales even more if there are several of them. Fame is what puts a book into the hands of readers.

Many people buy books because of reviews. Authors and publishers are sad if there are no reviews. Publishers like good and bad reviews because they make people talk about the book. Publishers are happy when a review says the same thing they think about a book. Publishers and newspapers both want reviews, but for different reasons. Newspapers want to entertain readers. Publishers want good reviews for their books. Reviews are better now than 40 years ago. But paperbacks do not get many reviews. Reviews are a cheap way to make books famous. Good reviews from trusted people can sell books. For some publishers, reviews are like air - very important. They need reviews because they do not have famous authors or ads. Good reviews are better than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often want big reviews, not just the words. Good reviews can start a book's success, but other things like people talking are also needed. In the UK, reviews do not always change sales like in the US. Sometimes, books with bad reviews sell a lot. It is hard to know what will happen. For non-fiction, reviewers sometimes talk about the subject, not the book. All publishers want good reviews. But good reviews do not always sell books. One publisher had a book with great reviews, but it did not sell because people read the reviews instead of buying the book.

Publisher E acknowledged that publishers aspire to glowing reviews, but these do not guarantee sales; for instance, a well-reviewed biography failed because readers felt the reviews sufficed.

We inquired with five prominent British publishers regarding the effect of reviews on commercial achievement. Publisher A asserted that reviews are fundamental; empirical evidence indicates that reviews are the primary motivator for book purchases, surpassing advertisements and word-of-mouth. While both authors and publishers are dismayed by the absence of reviews, publishers maintain equanimity towards negative critiques, contending that any media exposure can stimulate sales by encouraging readers to evaluate the book independently. Publishers experience gratification when a review aligns precisely with their own assessment. Publisher B noted the symbiotic relationship between publishers and the press, though their objectives diverge: newspapers aim to provide engaging material, whereas publishers seek favorable reviews for their titles. The landscape of book reviewing has evolved over four decades, becoming more varied and less exclusive, yet a persistent bias against paperbacks remains. Reviews constitute a cost-efficient method of promotion, and persuasive accounts from esteemed reviewers can substantially drive sales. Publisher C characterized reviews as indispensable for literary publishing, especially for works by non-brand-name authors who rely on review coverage in lieu of advertising. Favorable reviews possess greater credibility than advertisements, as they are perceived as impartial assessments. Although positive reviews can catalyze a book's success and elevate an author's career, they must synergize with elements like word-of-mouth networks and strategic marketing to achieve remarkable sales. Publisher D reflected on the enigmatic nature of the UK market, where reviews do not exert the decisive influence seen in the US, exemplified by the New York Times. Some authors accumulate readership gradually through consistent critical acclaim, while others achieve commercial triumph despite adverse reviews. In non-fiction, reviewers occasionally prioritize the subject over the book's content. Publisher E observed that while publishers and authors covet uniformly positive reviews, their commercial impact is not assured; a biography with exemplary reviews failed commercially because potential buyers deemed the reviews sufficient. Previously, the reviewer's reputation swayed public opinion, but contemporary buyers are motivated by the reviewer's unexpected choice or the review's intellectual vigor and originality."}

Braving these hazards, barefooted and with only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero will shin a mature tree in minutes to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow down to a bag below. Each chiclero must carry the liquid on","target_text":"Chewing gum culture is both fashionable and classless, with Americans chewing 12 million sticks per day. It is classified as a food due to its caloric content of fewer than ten calories per stick, necessitating compliance with American Food and Drug Administration standards. Contemporary gum is predominantly synthetic, augmented with pine resins and softeners to retain flavor and improve texture. Historically, the ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, primarily utilized by women for dental cleanliness and breath sweetening. American colonists emulated Native Americans by chewing spruce resin, which was commercialized in the early 19th century as the first chewing gum in the United States. The foundation of modern gum lies in the late 1860s discovery of chicle, derived from the sapodilla tree in Central American rainforests, which yielded a superior, elastic chew and spawned an entire industry. Nevertheless, commercial cultivation of sapodilla has proven unsuccessful, leading to the development of synthetic substitutes. The remaining chicleros, who gather chicle, face arduous and perilous conditions, trekking through near-100% humidity forests inhabited by highly poisonous snakes and abundant insects, including the troublesome chicle fly that oviposits in their ears and noses. Equipped merely with ropes and axes, they adeptly scale trees to channel the sap into collection bags, then transport the liquid to forest camps where it is boiled into bricks. Camp life is equally challenging, characterized by a monotonous, maize-based diet and local sugarcane alcohol. Despite these hardships, chicleros are concerned about their livelihoods, as chicle imports have drastically diminished; for example, annual U.S. imports fell from 7,000 tonnes to a mere 200 tonnes in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. In response, manufacturers have increasingly adopted synthetics to curb expenses and satisfy escalating demand. Gum producers employ innovative marketing strategies, promoting benefits such as relaxation, energy enhancement, and tension alleviation—notably supplied to soldiers in both world wars—with the foremost claim being the reduction of tooth decay through increased salivary flow that neutralizes plaque acid and supplies minerals. Research persists in refining textures and flavors, utilizing substances like g"}

The Taklamakan Desert in western China stands as one of the final unexplored and perilous regions on the planet. Charles Blackmore successfully traversed it and recounted his experience. Contemporary narratives seldom feature such intrepid explorers, whom Charles embodies. He spearheaded an expedition across this desert, ominously termed the Desert of Death. The team comprised four Britons, an American photographer, four Chinese specialists, thirty camels, and six handlers. Ironically, the handlers were long-distance lorry drivers lacking camel expertise, a misstep that nearly jeopardised the venture. They covered 1,200 kilometres of the world's most inhospitable desert in 59 days. Charles, transitioning from a 14-year Army career, embarked on this quest for self-discovery.

We went to four contrasting offices, to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist, who studies people's working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. Here are their verdicts. Office A. Advertising Agency Building Health Consultant: This office is about as simple as it could possibly be; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows opening straight onto the street. It is difficult to see why this space works but the occupants who are part of a small, dynamic team, appear to have few complaints. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators -- pretty much, perhaps, as they do in their own homes. This may be the key: a team of seven people have crated a happy, homely working environment and do not have to put up with any externally imposed bureaucracy. Ergonomist: The furniture here has evolved; no two pieces match. Much of it actually creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable and many are broken. Although in that way this environment is poor, the personnel have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, out meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom and muscular problems. Occupational Psychologist: Staff are delighted with the variety of work and the versatility of the office space.

The 'autonomous house', conceived and constructed by Robert and Brenda Vale, represents the pinnacle of green living. The Vales harness rainwater for domestic purposes, convert sewage into garden compost, and derive heating from residual heat generated by electrical appliances and the bodily warmth of their three adolescent children and two felines. Discreetly situated with a clay pantile roof, the house harmonizes with the historic conservation area through its burnt-orange brick facade. Its super-insulated structure, featuring krypton-infused triple-glazed windows, ensures profound interior silence, necessitating manual ventilation via ingenious shafts to offset comprehensive draft-proofing measures. As architecture lecturers, the Vales have championed environmental causes for decades, evidenced by their 1970s publication 'The Autonomous House'. Their design prioritizes zero carbon dioxide emissions and independence from mains water, incorporating composting toilets, subterranean rainwater storage, and copper gutters with dual filtration for potable water. They eschew dishwashers on ethical grounds against harsh detergents. Robert articulates their aim to demonstrate that eco-conscious housing need not sacrifice comfort or modernity. The household incurs no water expenses and consumes minimal electricity, with impending solar installations poised to generate an energy surplus. A modest wood-burning stove is infrequently utilized, as the dwelling retains heat efficiently in winter, leveraging factors like radiant heat balance for perceived comfort. Constructed affordably using conventional materials, this low-tech approach encounters opposition from the commercial building sector."}
{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Career Power Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take full control at work. A. What makes a good leader? A leader is one who inspires, an agent of change, a developer who shows the way forward. Leadership is not about breeding or height - taller being better, as the early theorists believed. It's not simply about intelligence, either. Pat Dixon, author of the book Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace, says that leadership is about 'making things happen through people who are as enhuastic and interested as you are'. Enthusiasm is a key element and, to convey it and encourage it in others, a good leader should be able to speak out articulately and with conviction. 'It's having the confidence to say \"I believe\" instead of \"I think\", maintains Dixon. B. John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, says, 'Most people have a far greater potential for leadership than they realise. The process of becoming a leader is recognising those latent talents, developing them and using them.' In one sense, we are all born leaders - we just need the right circumstances in which to flourish. While it's quite easy to recognise leadership in the grand sense -- be it in the form of figures like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Ghandi or even Richard Branson - it may be more difficult to relate it to our own workplace. And yet this quality is now regarded as the cornerstone of effective management. C. Consider the best and worst boss you've ever had. They may have been equally good at setting objectives, meeting deadlines and budgets. But what about how they achieved them? The best leader will have motivated you and may have given you support. The worst leader would have made you feel like a small cog in the corporate machinery and kept information from you, and then when things went wrong would have reacted as if it were your fault. The first led (very well); the second simply managed (very badly). D. Leaders and managers can be seen as different animals. Managers tend to enjoy working according to set boundaries.

Get ahead by motivating yourself to control your work. What is a good leader? A leader inspires people, brings change, and shows the way. It is not about height or just intelligence. A writer says leadership is making things happen with enthusiastic people. Enthusiasm is key, so a leader must speak clearly and with confidence. Another expert says most people have hidden leadership skills. They need to find and use them. Everyone can be a leader in the right situation. It is important in management. Think of your best and worst boss. Both might set goals and meet deadlines, but the best motivates and supports you. The worst makes you feel unimportant and blames you. Leaders and managers are different. Managers work within set limits, while leaders create new ones. A good manager can run a company smoothly, but a good leader can change a sad organization. To improve your leadership, find your passions and act on them. See yourself as a leader. Sometimes, lead firmly and try new styles. Set goals and beat them. Leadership comes from taking charge, taking risks, and learning. Communicate well to win others over. Be visible and help key people, but you do not have to lead all the time."}

What defines a good leader? A leader inspires others, acts as an agent of change, and guides progress. Leadership is not determined by physical traits like height, as early theories suggested, nor is it solely about intelligence. According to Pat Dixon, author of 'Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,' leadership involves making things happen through people who share your enthusiasm. To convey and foster this enthusiasm, a leader must speak articulately and with conviction, expressing beliefs confidently. John van Maurik, a leadership course director, notes that most people have untapped leadership potential; becoming a leader requires recognizing, developing, and applying these talents. While it is easy to see leadership in famous figures, it can be harder to apply it to one's own workplace, yet it is essential for effective management. Reflect on your best and worst bosses; both may have been competent in tasks, but the best motivated and supported you, whereas the worst made you feel insignificant and withheld information, blaming you for failures. Leaders and managers differ: managers operate within established boundaries, while leaders create new horizons. Improving leadership skills involves discovering your passions, viewing yourself as a leader, experimenting with styles, setting and exceeding goals, and learning from risks and mistakes. Effective communication is crucial to avoid alienating colleagues, and being accessible to key individuals is important, but leadership is not required constantly."}

'A good manager can keep even an inefficient company running relatively smoothly,' writes","target_text":"Career Power: Attain a leading edge by motivating yourself to assume complete control in your professional life. What constitutes an effective leader? A leader is someone who inspires, serves as a catalyst for change, and charts the course forward. Leadership is not contingent on inherent qualities such as stature or superior intelligence, contrary to early beliefs. Pat Dixon, in her book 'Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace,' asserts that leadership entails achieving outcomes through individuals who are as enthusiastic and engaged as oneself. Conveying and cultivating this enthusiasm necessitates articulate and conviction-filled communication, where confidence replaces hesitation. John van Maurik, director of a leadership course, emphasizes that most individuals possess latent leadership capabilities far beyond their awareness; the journey to leadership involves identifying, honing, and deploying these talents. Although leadership is readily observable in prominent historical or business figures, its relevance to one's own work environment may be less apparent, yet it is regarded as the cornerstone of proficient management. Consider your experiences with superiors: the exemplary leader motivates and bolsters your efforts, while the inferior one induces a sense of insignificance, withholds critical information, and attributes blame erroneously. Leaders and managers are distinct; managers excel within predefined parameters, whereas leaders forge new frontiers. Enhancing leadership skills entails aligning with personal passions, adopting a leader identity, varying leadership approaches, establishing and surpassing objectives, and deriving insights from taking initiative and errors. Leadership development hinges on practical application, risk-taking, and refinement of delegation, motivation, and communication to garner support without necessarily seeking popularity. Maintain visibility and accessibility to pivotal individuals, but exercise discernment in when to lead, focusing on essential contributions and fostering leadership in others."}

The hotel boasts three red stars, signifying its elite status among 4,000 in the guide, yet Sue found the access from the car park—via an unmanned door with a buzzer and a long, twisting corridor—disappointing. The receptionist then asserted there was no record of Sue's booking, even though most rooms were vacant. Sue examined a top-floor room that was stuffy and had a gaping panel in the wardrobe revealing a hole in the wall. She disclosed her role to the manager, Robin Greaves, whose face showed terror; he immediately apologized for a unpleasant smell in the main lounge, attributing it to a potentially blocked drain. Sue recommended addressing the plumbing and steering guests away from that room. Greaves, relatively new to his position, took notes with glum enthusiasm, grappling with the idea that the critique would ultimately benefit the hotel. Sue praised specific staff, such as Emma and Trudy, who provided historical notes, and noted that dinner upheld the two-rosette food rating. When Greaves asked about achieving three rosettes, Sue pointed out the need to avoid desserts that collapse. Her job entails articulating criticisms that timid consumers avoid, sometimes provoking hostile responses, but she delivers comprehensive reports. She informed Greaves that the red stars would remain, though a follow-up inspection would occur to verify corrections."}

Elbrus in Europe, G. Carstensz Pyramid in Australasia. On Mt. Everest, while in a snow cave below the summit, his partner Dougal Haston began speaking to their equipment officer who wasn't present, likely due to oxygen deprivation. Scott also talked to his feet, worrying about frostbite from the cold. He reflected on their time on the summit ridge, feeling confident with Haston and adjusting his rhythm to reach the top. On Mt. McKinley, considered the most treacherous mountain, they arrived at the glacier, carried equipment, and realized the challenge's scale. They followed an old route initially but pioneered a new one alpine style, carrying all gear. The low polar air pressure made it feel like 7,000m, causing suffering, but they succeeded. On Kilimanjaro, they intended to climb Mt. Kenya but took a free opportunity to Kilimanjaro. Lost in dense jungles with water scarcity, they found guidance from painted arrows and rubbish leading to a pool. After a hazardous attempt on a icicle wall, they prudently switched to the Umbwe route for the summit. On Aconcagua, the standard route is straightforward. Meeting guide Phil Erscheler, they avoided crowds via the Polish Glacier but skipped it due to bad weather and time constraints, joining others on the north ridges. Other climbers inspired him to pursue the Seven Summits goal. On Vinson Massif, financing the trip through guiding made the quest feasible. In Antarctica, with perpetual daylight and silence, they summited in harsh winds and extreme cold, though storm reduced visibility. On Elbrus, after acclimatization and cable car travel, they faced windy, icy slopes and mistakenly thought they had summited before discovering a longer ridge. On"}

He retrospectively contemplated their summit ridge experience, deriving assurance from Haston's presence and refining his climbing rhythm to achieve the apex. On Mt. McKinley, deemed the world's most perilous mountain, they commenced by transporting provisions to the base, swiftly apprehending the undertaking's magnitude. Adhering initially to an established route, they diverged to forge a novel path alpine style, a pioneering feat for the locale. The reduced atmospheric pressure in polar regions exacerbated the physiological strain, simulating an altitude of 7,000m, yet they persevered to triumph. On Kilimanjaro, originally bound for Mt. Kenya, an unforeseen offer diverted them to Kilimanjaro. Disoriented in impenetrable jungles amid water scarcity, they serendipitously encountered luminous markers and detritus guiding them to a rock pool. After an abortive assault on a formidable icicle, they judiciously elected the Umbwe route to attain the surreal summit.

Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.' Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless","target_text":"The notion that handwriting can unveil a person's character is increasingly endorsed. In various countries, job applicants are frequently obliged to submit a handwriting specimen, which may substantially determine their appropriateness for the role. Graphology, the analysis of handwriting, is acknowledged as a legitimate scientific discipline in numerous regions. Investigators assert that it serves as a valuable instrument for detecting ailments like heart disease and cancer, and for disclosing psychological conditions and emotional disturbances. Its application is growing in vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews, with many major corporations engaging graphologists to scrutinize the handwriting of prospective candidates for pivotal positions. Nonetheless, the majority of medical practitioners and psychiatrists persist in their skepticism regarding graphology's efficacy. Patricia Marne, a graphologist with over two decades of professional experience, contends that it warrants greater consideration. She maintains that handwriting can reveal psychological attributes as well as specific medical issues. Ms. Marne posits that handwriting is a potent indicator of social stratification and intellect, and it can evaluate cognitive capabilities, aptitudes for arts or sciences, and whether an individual possesses a duplicitous or forthright nature. Graphology proves especially beneficial in appraising potential criminal proclivities; offenders typically exhibit disordered, poorly formed handwriting that mirrors impoverished backgrounds and stunted emotional maturation. It can also forewarn of imminent violence, intolerable stress, or psychopathic inclinations, and even anticipate suicidal intentions. Cardiac and pulmonary complications might manifest if handwriting becomes tremulous or fragmented over a period, or if a signature develops previously absent discontinuities. Acute emotional distress can induce temporary alterations in signatures. Additional psychological characteristics include: script where letters form threads, denoting cunning and intelligence; predominant use of capital letters, suggesting concealment of authentic identity; very light pressure, indicating sensitivity and diminished vitality; originality in penmanship, reflecting self-assurance and artistic talent; and disconnected writing, emblematic of isolation. Diminutive signatures signify inhibition and an inferiority complex; circular dots over 'i's represent a quest for attention; and heavily crossed 't's spanning entire words denote"}

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: The end of print may take some time Peter Preston Transition. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless, that is, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process - because, frankly, it may not be a process at all. But surely (you say) it is bound to happen eventually. Everybody knows that print newspaper sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Just look at the latest print circulation figures. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and many of the rest are down overall between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites go ever higher. All of which may well be true, depending on timing, demography, geography and more. After all, everyone - from web academics to print analysts - says so. Yet pause for a while and count a few little things that don't quite fit. So if sales in that area have fallen so little, perhaps the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, though, the messages are oddly mixed. The latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to find in the eye of the digital storm - they had a 5.4% increase to report.

Transition is generally a positive concept, implying steady progress, but for newspapers moving online, it is fraught with uncertainty. While it is widely accepted that print sales are decreasing and online traffic is increasing—for example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen annual declines of 8-10% in print but growth online—the reality is more complex. Globally, newspaper circulation actually rose by 1.1% last year, driven by gains in Asia that offset Western losses. News magazines experienced a 5.4% increase, and although e-reader sales are surging, physical book sales fell by only 0.4%. Contrary to myths, many young people still read newspapers, with nearly 5 million aged 15-35 engaging with national dailies. Trends vary by country: Britain saw significant drops, while Germany and France had modest declines. Assumptions about online advertising funding the transition have proven incorrect, as digital ad revenues are falling. Print remains crucial for selling digital subscriptions and generates substantially higher advertising income, though maintaining both formats is challenging for newspaper companies."}

Transition typically conveys a sense of orderly change, yet for newspapers adapting to the digital realm, it is an uneasy and ambiguous journey. Although evidence indicates declining print circulations—such as The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian experiencing 8-10% yearly drops—coupled with rising online visits, the broader picture is nuanced. Global newspaper circulation increased by 1.1% last year, with Asian growth compensating for Western declines, and news magazines reported a 5.4% rise. E-readers like Kindle are flourishing, but physical book sales diminished by a mere 0.4%, indicating a coexistence of digital and print formats. Surveys refute claims that youth are deserting newspapers; approximately 5 million individuals aged 15-35 regularly read major national dailies. National disparities are evident: Britain faced sharp declines, whereas Germany and France saw more moderate reductions. Previous expectations that online advertising would finance the digital shift have been undermined by falling revenues, and print advertising continues to yield significantly higher returns. Consequently, print editions are instrumental in promoting digital subscriptions, despite the complexities and costs of sustaining both platforms."}

He previously traveled in the Americas after university and always wanted to do it again, but life got in the way with a relationship, career, and buying a flat. He realized he was sacrificing his personal satisfaction for his salary. Now, without a job, partner, or major career ambitions, he feels free, and his married friends envy his lack of responsibilities. Tim is anxious about practical arrangements, such as renting out his flat and choosing destinations. As a procrastinator, he has delayed his departure, partly due to fears about adapting to backpacking and fitting in with younger travelers. This trend is growing among people in their late twenties and thirties. Jennifer Cox of Lonely Planet observes that people now understand adventures are accessible if they are brave and organized. For example, Danny and Tammy are taking a year off before settling down, and Danny symbolically discarded his calculator. Matt used travel to transition from military life to civilian existence. Angela Baron explains that flexible work contracts make such breaks feasible, and companies sometimes offer career-break policies. Dan Hiscocks notes that travel allows people to reassess their lives. Jennifer Cox argues this reflects a societal shift towards valuing balanced lives over mere bill-paying. Ben, heading to Central America, feels trepidation about leaving his comfortable routine. Tim's decision was catalyzed by an intolerable boss, and he now looks forward to the journey with excitement."}

He reflects on his past travels in the Americas after university and his subsequent life choices, including falling in love, pursuing a career, and acquiring a flat, which led him to feel he was compromising his self-worth for financial stability. Currently unattached and without pressing career aspirations, he perceives an obligation to utilise his freedom, a sentiment envied by his married friends with children. Tim's anxieties encompass practicalities like organising the rental of his flat and selecting destinations, compounded by his tendency to procrastinate and emotional ties that make departure difficult. He questions his ability to readjust to a basic lifestyle and integrate with younger backpackers. This phenomenon is increasingly common among Britons in their late twenties and thirties. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet identifies a growing awareness that adventure is attainable for those with courage and organisation, as seen in Danny and Tammy, who are taking a pre-settlement year off, with Danny performing a symbolic act of defiance by discarding his calculator. Matt utilised travel for personal transformation after military service. Angela Baron highlights the flexibility in modern employment, such as short-term contracts and career-break policies, facilitating such excursions. Dan Hiscocks suggests that travel provides an opportunity for life reassessment in an era where jobs are no longer perceived as permanent. Jennifer Cox contends this trend indicates a societal evolution towards prioritising balanced living over mere subsistence. Ben, departing for Central America, shares reservations about abandoning his routine, while Tim acknowledges that an intolerable boss acted as a catalyst for his journey, now filling him with mounting excitement for the forthcoming adventure."}

I met him at his workshop beneath a railway arch in East London, where he appeared hurried, greeting me with a brisk handshake. It was unclear if this brusqueness was genuine or a cover for shyness, but the busy workshop showed he had little time to spare. The space was filled with partially completed furniture and wood planks in a variety of natural hues. With ten years of experience, Hurst has built a solid reputation, and his order book is consistently full for months in advance without any self-promotion. People recommend him for quality items like cupboards, tables, bookcases, or kitchen units. While furniture makers are common in the countryside, it is harder to find one who focuses on clean, simple designs. Hurst notes that true cabinet-makers are rare today and expresses weariness over some contemporary furniture, criticizing shoddy, mass-produced goods. His dedication to perfection and innate talent are key to his success. He openly acknowledges his ability, stating he has a natural gift for making things, though he later showed some modesty. Self-taught, he learned by asking questions and now mainly works for private individuals, having found commercial work unfulfilling. Repeat clients are satisfying, but he admits that relationships can be strained, especially with indecisive clients. Hurst praises other skilled craftsmen but is unyielding in his criticism of those who prioritize art over utility or take excessive time. Ultimately, he maintains a practical, humble view, emphasizing that furniture should be functional."}

During my visit to his workshop, situated under a railway arch in East London, he conveyed an impression of haste with a swift handshake and an invitation to begin immediately. Whether this brusque demeanor was authentic or a facade for shyness remained ambiguous, but the cluttered workshop, brimming with unfinished furniture and an array of naturally colored wood planks, attested to his busy schedule. Having practiced cabinet-making for a decade, Hurst has cultivated an excellent reputation, resulting in an order book perpetually filled for months ahead, despite his lack of self-promotion. Recommendations ensure a steady stream of clients seeking quality cupboards, tables, bookcases, or kitchen units. Although locating a furniture-maker is generally straightforward in rural settings, identifying one who prides themselves on elegantly simple designs is more challenging. Hurst laments the scarcity of genuine cabinet-makers today, expressing disillusionment with much contemporary furniture and condemning inferior, mass-produced items. His success is rooted in an unwavering pursuit of perfection and his evident talent; he displays unabashed self-confidence, claiming a natural aptitude for craftsmanship, though he later revealed a self-deprecating side. Entirely self-taught, he acquired his skills through inquiry and now primarily accepts commissions from private individuals, having abandoned commercial work he found soul-destroying. While he derives satisfaction from repeat clients who engage him for entire homes, he candidly acknowledges that client relationships can be fraught, particularly with those who are indecisive. Hurst is gracious in acknowledging superior craftsmen but remains critical of those who prioritize artistic statements over practicality or prolong production unnecessarily. In conclusion, despite his confidence, he exhibits a grounded humility, asserting that he is merely producing functional furniture."}

Film critic Nick James evaluates several recent releases. A: Abyss. Directed by James Cameron prior to Titanic, this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller depicts oil riggers and naval specialists endeavoring to salvage a nuclear submarine stranded miles beneath the ocean. The banter and self-deprecating bravery of the characters evoke memories of Howard Hawks' laconic heroes, with highly impressive production design and special effects, though the dialogue and characterization are weak, rendering the story B-movie material. B: The Thin Red Line. The video version of Andrew Marton's adaptation of James Jones' novel about the Guadalcanal battle serves as a fascinating contrast to Terrence Malick's mystical and poetic film. Marton's approach is more conventional, concentrating on a single soldier and his relationship with an abrasive sergeant, and it includes moments such as a harshly handled flashback that may surpass Malick's soft-focus imagery. C: On Guard. Loosely derived from Paul Féval's 1875 novel, this corny yet highly watchable swashbuckler surpasses typical musketeer adventures. It features a consummate villain in Fabrice Luchini's character and an exuberant hero played by Vincent Perez, with Daniel Auteuil contributing effectively as an acrobat-turned-swordsman, all presented with wit and sparkle that elevate the clichés. D: Character. A handsome but dour narrative set in turn-of-the-century Rotterdam, where excessive production and costume design give it a museum-like quality. Jan Decleir portrays a brutal bailiff in a morose manner, whose ruthless eviction practices and antagonistic relationship with his son form the core, though the film prioritizes period detail over the dark parable. E: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. This digitally remastered re-release showcases director Leone's craftsmanship optimally, with standout sound editing that captures every detail. The storytelling is relentlessly cruel, punctuated by Morricone's magnificent music to maintain tension, and morally, the characters—Clint East"}

Currently, the Summer Boat Show in London displays numerous yachts equipped with advanced technology, most stemming from a hull-shape revolution 25 years ago. In contrast, his boat lies quietly on a south coast tidal creek; designed recently, it appears a century old, suggesting its owner might be a romantic. Cunliffe acknowledges benefiting from traditional design enhanced by modern techniques. He notes that sophisticated technology, while essential today, often isolates crews from the maritime realities they originally sought. He does not advocate for enduring all hardships—his boat includes a coal stove and comfortable berths—but questions the purpose of cruising if sails set themselves. He believes occasional struggles with sails and secure steering positions are part of seafaring life, criticizing moves that prioritize spacious cabins over practicality. For him, a boat should remain a boat, not a watery cottage. His earlier boat, Hirta, which he sailed around Britain for TV, had no modern amenities like pumped water, electricity, or electronics but was exceptionally easy to handle. However, classic boats require significant upkeep; a back injury ended his long ownership, leading him to build a new boat. The Westerman, designed by Nigel Irens and Ed Burnett, began with a sketch on a napkin before computer modeling and traditional model carving. After revisions, the final design proved perfect, enabling Atlantic crossings and race victories. The boat's ageless appearance, pleasant motion, and peaceful accommodation—featuring reclaimed pitch pine—result from a focus on sailing function over interior furnishings. Constructed with waterproof treated timber, it combines the durability of fiberglass with the authentic look and feel of a traditional boat, proving that historical lessons can yield satisfaction without following trends."}

The Summer Boat Show in London currently exhibits an array of sophisticated yachts, replete with cutting-edge technology largely derived from a hull-shape transformation a quarter-century ago. Conversely, his own vessel rests serenely on a tidal creek along the south coast; though conceived last year, its aesthetic evokes a centenarian artifact, potentially implying the proprietor is a nostalgic romantic. Cunliffe concedes that while he may embody such traits, the boat leverages the enchantment of archaic design, augmented indispensably by modern advancements. He contends, however, that despite its utility in contemporary design and construction, advanced technology frequently insulates mariners from the austere realities of nautical existence—realities often the very impetus for their maritime pursuits. He clarifies that he does not advocate for the endurance of every privation; his boats invariably incorporate amenities like coal stoves for warmth and snug berths. Yet, he queries the essence of cruising if sails automate their deployment. The sporadic contention with unruly canvas is integral to a seafarer's experience, and relocating the helm from the secure aft to a precarious position amidships, merely to accommodate opulent cabins, defies logic. For Cunliffe, a vessel must unequivocally remain a boat, not an aquatic domicile. Reflecting on his prior boat, Hirta, which he circumnavigated Britain with for a television series, the previous owner remarked it offered every comfort sans luxury. Throughout their protracted association, Hirta, devoid of pumped water, substantive electricity, refrigeration, heating, winches, and electronics—particularly in navigation—demonstrated unparalleled kindness and ease at sea. Nonetheless, the antiquity of classic boats necessitates arduous maintenance; a severe back injury compelled Cunliffe to terminate his 15-year"}

{"input_text":"simplify to B2: In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports. Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Yet one of his greatest accomplishments, in the eyes of his contemporaries, was to chart, using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore, the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now known as 'declination', that is, the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without it, sailors were unable to correct their compasses. It was therefore impossible to deduce longitude precisely and navigate the oceans. So it was that Halley, one of only two men in the land at that time paid to conduct scientific research, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands with the grand plan of charting declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time. This voyage took him and his crew to Rio de Janeiro, down past South Georgia, up again to Newfoundland and back to England. From these travels Halley published, in 170I, a 'New and Correct Chart shewing the Variations of the Compasse in the Western and Southern Oceans'. More sophisticated successors to this primitive cartographic effort proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century, before a slow change in the terrestrial magnetic field rendered them inaccurate. If all goes well, Halley's accomplishments will be celebrated once again. Dr Clark, himself a keen sailor, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore. PS70,000 will have to be raised before he embarks, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is providing support for his efforts to do this.

This was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and determine longitude accurately. Halley, among the few scientists funded at the time, embarked on voyages aboard the Paramore to chart declination in the Atlantic. Although the initial expedition was aborted due to crew insubordination, he later completed a journey spanning from Rio de Janeiro to South Georgia and Newfoundland, resulting in a published chart in 1701. This pioneering effort laid the foundation for maritime navigation for more than a century. Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey and an avid sailor, intends to retrace Halley's route to mark the 300th anniversary. He requires substantial funding and has garnered support, including from Sir Vivian Fuchs. Inspired by Halley's multifaceted career during a posting in Antarctica, Dr. Clark will employ precise instruments to update magnetic field measurements, refining the international geomagnetic reference field. His expedition, titled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', aims to grant Halley due recognition and contribute scientifically. With extensive experience, including a transatlantic sail and work in geomagnetism, Dr. Clark is well-qualified and passionately committed to this endeavor."}

Over centuries, knowledge from the Romans and Normans improved apple cultivation in Britain, leading to varieties such as the Pearmain and Costard. Settlers spread apples worldwide, with figures like Johnny Appleseed promoting their growth. In the 19th century, new types like the Delicious and Granny Smith apples were discovered and became globally popular. However, modern commercial farming has reduced diversity, with only a few varieties grown for their appearance and durability. It is important to preserve apple diversity for future generations."}
{"input_text":"simplify to B2: A history of the apple Apples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size. But the late twentieth century is in danger of squandering its heritage. Prehistoric wilding 8,000 BC Human beings have been munching apples since prehistoric times. They spat out apple-pips in neolithic Britain. And 10,000 years ago they left apple remains to carbonise around their Swiss and Italian lakeside homes. In Switzerland and in the regions adjoining the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even appear to have dry-stored apple-halves for winter. But these were wild crab apples, tiny wizened fruit which, in Ancient Britain came to be known as 'windings'. They had little in common with the apples we know today. Norman knowledge 1000 AD From the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended. Mediaeval favourites 1200 Several kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word 'costermonger' - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street.

The Romans and Normans introduced advanced horticultural techniques to Britain, where monastic efforts fostered the development of numerous apple varieties, including the Pearmain and Costard. As settlers migrated, they carried apples to new continents, exemplified by Johnny Appleseed's extensive plantings in North America. The 19th century saw the emergence of iconic apples such as the Delicious and Granny Smith, originating from serendipitous discoveries. In contemporary times, commercial prioritization of uniformity threatens genetic diversity, underscoring the necessity to advocate for the conservation of varied apple types to sustain ecological and culinary richness."}

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Photography Over the past one and a half centuries, photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the medium has expanded its capabilities in the recording of time and space, thus allowing human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment or to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. It has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. Indeed, the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition. Nonetheless, the recording of events by means of the visual image has a much longer history. The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. And although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of the early cave paintings - whether they record the 'actual' events of hunting, whether they functioned as sympathetic magic to encourage the increase of animals for hunting, whether they had a role as religious icons, or if they were made simply to enliven and brighten domestic activities - pictorial images seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society. The popular notion that 'seeing is believing' had always afforded special status to the visual image.

In the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of photography appeared to offer the promise of 'automatically' providing a truthful visual record. It was seen not only as the culmination of Western visual representation but, quite simply, the camera, functioning in much the same way as the human eye, was regarded as a machine which could provide a fixed image.

It started about 150 years ago. People use it to show all parts of life. It can show fast moments, big things, and small things. It brings us pictures from far places, like other countries or space. It also shows problems in society. Photography is a very important way to tell about people's lives. But drawing pictures to record things is much older. The first drawings were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We do not know why they made these drawings. Maybe for hunting, magic, religion, or to make their homes nice. Pictures have always been part of human culture. People think that if you see something, you believe it. So when photography was invented, it had a big effect on society. In the 1800s, photography was seen as a true record. The camera works like the human eye and makes a fixed image. This image is close to what we see. Photography was also a big cultural achievement. Artists had worked for years to make such images. Some thought that everyone could understand photos, like a universal language. For example, a photographer said in 1933 that even a Bushman could understand a photo of the sky. But now, with more communication, we ask if photos can be understood by all cultures. Or are they like language, different for each culture? We are so used to photos that we may not see the hard work in making them. Photos seem very real, so we often do not think about the difference between the real world and the photo. For example, someone might show a photo and say, 'This is my grandson.' Since 1839, photography has changed a lot. Photos were first used to record things in the 1800s. Now, they are old and show history. They tell us about the people and society that made them. I want to show that the camera is not just a passive tool. It does not only show culture; it can help change society. For example, in the 1400s, new ways of drawing changed culture in Italy. Similarly, photography has helped create our media culture. It also brings hard truths about the world to our homes."}

It provides images from distant places on Earth, parts of the solar system, and the complex issues of modern society. Photography is one of the most important ways to express the human experience. However, recording events with images has a much longer history. The earliest picture-making dates back about 35,000 years to the Upper Palaeolithic period, with cave paintings.

When photography was invented, it had a huge social and cultural impact. In the mid-1800s, photography promised to give a truthful visual record automatically. It was seen as the peak of Western image-making. The camera works similarly to the human eye and produces a fixed image that is very close to what we see. The chemical process captured these images as natural phenomena. At the same time, photography was a cultural achievement, creating the kind of image artists had tried to make for centuries. Because photos seemed so realistic, some thought everyone could understand them naturally, leading to the idea that photography is a universal language. For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even a Bushman could understand a photo of the sky. But with increased global communication, we now question if photos can cross cultural barriers or if they are as culturally specific as language. Our familiarity with photos might make us overlook the skill involved in making them. Photos are so convincing that the medium often seems invisible, blurring the line between reality and the image. For example, it's common for someone to show a photo and say, 'This is my grandson.' Since its invention in 1839, photography technology and attitudes have changed greatly. This is partly because photography has entered 'mythic time'—its original role as a 19th-century recorder has expanded beyond human scale, and old photos are now historical documents that reveal much about the society that produced them.

{"input_text":"simplify to C1: Photography Over the past one and a half centuries, photography has been used to record all aspects of human life and activity. During this relatively short history, the medium has expanded its capabilities in the recording of time and space, thus allowing human vision to be able to view the fleeting moment or to visualise both the vast and the minuscule. It has brought us images from remote areas of the world, distant parts of the solar system, as well as the social complexities and crises of modern life. Indeed, the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of expressing the human condition. Nonetheless, the recording of events by means of the visual image has a much longer history. The earliest creations of pictorial recording go as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic period of about 35,000 years ago. And although we cannot be sure of the exact purposes of the early cave paintings - whether they record the 'actual' events of hunting, whether they functioned as sympathetic magic to encourage the increase of animals for hunting, whether they had a role as religious icons, or if they were made simply to enliven and brighten domestic activities - pictorial images seem to be inextricably linked to human culture as we understand it. Throughout the history of visual representation, questions have been raised concerning the supposed accuracy (or otherwise) of the visual image, as well as its status in society. The popular notion that 'seeing is believing' had always afforded special status to the visual image. So when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense. In the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of photography appeared to offer the promise of 'automatically' providing a truthful visual record. It was seen not only as the culmination of Western visual representation but, quite simply, the camera, functioning in much the same way as the human eye, was regarded as a machine which could provide a fixed image. And this image was considered to be a very close approximation to that which we actually see. The chemical fixing of the image enabled the capture of what might be considered a natural phenomenon: the camera image. At the same time, the photographic image was held to be an achievement of sophisticated culture and produced the type of image that artists had struggled","target_text":"Throughout the past one and a half centuries, photography has been utilized to chronicle every dimension of human life and endeavor. During this comparatively brief historical span, the medium has augmented its capabilities in the documentation of temporal and spatial realms, thereby enabling human vision to apprehend transient moments and to conceptualize both the macroscopic and the microscopic. It has proffered imagery from inaccessible regions of the globe, distant precincts of the solar system, alongside the social intricacies and exigencies of contemporary existence. Indeed, the photographic medium has furnished one of the most paramount and influential modalities for articulating the human condition. Nevertheless, the recording of events through visual imagery possesses a considerably more protracted history. The earliest instantiations of pictorial recording extend as far back as the Upper Palaeolithic epoch, approximately 35,000 years ago. And while the precise purposes of these primordial cave paintings remain enigmatic—whether they documented veritable hunting episodes, functioned as sympathetic magic to potentiate the proliferation of game, served as religious icons, or were merely crafted to animate and embellish quotidian activities—pictorial representations appear inextricably intertwined with human culture as we apprehend it. Across the annals of visual representation, interrogations have been perpetually raised concerning the putative veracity of the visual image, as well as its societal standing. The ubiquitous aphorism that 'seeing is believing' has invariably conferred a privileged status upon visual imagery. Thus, upon the invention of photography, its social and cultural ramifications were profound. In the mid-nineteenth century, the advent of photography seemed to proffer the promise of automatically supplying a veridical visual record. It was perceived not only as the apotheosis of Western visual representation but, quite fundamentally, the camera, operating in a manner analogous to the human eye, was regarded as an apparatus capable of yielding a stabilized image. And this image was considered a proximate approximation to that which we empirically perceive.

In earlier periods, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, integrating art into daily life. Nowadays, we leave artists to their own creative processes and become irritated if they do not remain elevated and special. Picture This. I am going to describe a scenario and then pose a critical question. I hope it does not seem overly cryptic. An artist chooses a passage from an art book. The text reflects on the diversity of pictures, naively asking what they are about before concluding that there is no limit to the types of pictures. The artist then has another person prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter.

After this is done, my essential question is: is the resulting object a painting? Underground Encounters. At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26th. There is an unspoken rule for commercial success in painting: once an artist develops a profitable style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to consistently work in the same vein, and attempts to explore new directions are often met with disappointment and a sense of betrayal. The reasons for this are unclear; gallery owners likely prefer reliable investments, and the art-buying public may desire continuity for reassurance. Some artists successfully break this pattern, such as Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now boldly diverging from his usual form, and it is uncertain if he will succeed.

Over the last two hundred years, it has increasingly become the norm to assert that every artist must rebel against the art of their contemporaries. Art is frequently acclaimed for its uniqueness, revolutionary nature, or even its capacity to shock. We derive satisfaction from admiring artists whose work was not appreciated in previous eras. Yet, when confronted with the art of our own time, we grow apprehensive and contend that the artist has exceeded boundaries, to the extent that it can no longer be classified as art. The media propagate this viewpoint, and we largely concur because we anticipate being perplexed by art's persistent novelty. Consequently, we fail to notice the enduring themes, methods, and virtues that abound in contemporary art. We demand that artists be detached from the general populace, figures endowed with extraordinary talents and drive, so potent that they cannot be constrained by conventions. In bygone ages, individuals approached artists with commissions; art was required for specific functions and was an integral part of ordinary existence. Today, we allow artists to follow their own inclinations and become rather displeased if they aspire to descend from their elevated status. Picture This.

In theatre, audiences have different expectations. They often do not grasp the skill involved in acting and are not particularly impressed by something that seems similar to what they could do. For instance, completing a long speech does not usually amaze them, though actors are often asked how they memorize lines. This does not imply that theatre audiences are more generous; in fact, many are the same people who attend concerts. However, it suggests that in theatre, audiences and performers interact on more equal terms, regardless of the material's difficulty. Music could benefit from learning about this relationship. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humour, and melancholy, and it is vulnerable to unexpected issues, engaging listeners both individually and collectively. Conventional music presentations, with strict dress codes and high respect for conductors and soloists, often create an uncomfortable hierarchy. Conversely, modern audiences sometimes applaud between movements or after impressive solos, which, while appreciative, can harm the work's dramatic flow. There are ongoing efforts to attract new audiences and reduce barriers, such as community operas that involve the audience directly. I recall a transformative production of Jonathan Dove's community opera that moved through a cathedral and town, highlighting professional musicians' generosity. I desire more risk and innovation in music, similar to theatre, by using challenging locations to disrupt norms. Although most theatrical productions are conventional, I am convinced that music conventions should evolve. As an enthusiast who loves and supports both arts, I want them to"}

After a short stint working at a national opera house, I came to understand that opera is, in fact, secondary to music.

Observing elite music is not unlike watching an athletics competition; we acknowledge that athletes are performing activities akin to our own, such as running for a bus, but we also recognize the vast superiority of their efforts. In contrast, theatre audiences arrive with divergent expectations. Generally, they do not apprehend the nature of acting skill and are not particularly awed by an activity that often appears within their own capabilities. They are seldom impressed when an actor executes a lengthy and complex speech, despite the common inquiry about line memorization. This does not mean theatre audiences are more lenient or less exacting than those in concert halls; indeed, many individuals frequent both.

The question arises: can music glean insights from theatre regarding this dynamic? I believe so, partly because I have witnessed how an alternative approach can enhance the concert-goer's experience. Live music is inherently theatrical, imbued with passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, and grandeur, and it is susceptible to unforeseen mishaps, engaging the listener's imagination both individually and collectively.

Following a brief tenure at a national opera house, I ascertained that opera is, in actuality, only secondarily theatre, with music taking precedence—a rightful hierarchy. However, I hail from the theatrical domain, where the spoken word and the actor possess primacy, where no external director oversees the action once the event commences, and where performer and audience largely converse in a shared language. At musical performances, whether in concert halls or opera houses, there typically exists a substantial minority of individuals who, akin to myself, have scant technical or academic grasp of music.

This was an uncommon ambition among my peers, as cooking was not considered a desirable profession. Chefs are known for their tough working conditions, including long hours, high pressure, and low wages. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was dissatisfied with university life, finding the academic work challenging and the social environment pretentious. Becoming a chef appeared to be a genuine alternative, free from intellectual posturing. Additionally, it represented an aesthetic ideal. My inspiration came from a meal at a renowned London restaurant, which was a transformative experience. I developed a strong desire to master the art of cooking, so I devoted myself to reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals, often neglecting my formal studies. The swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular with tattooed arms. He taught me to dive by having me start with sitting rolls and progress to standing dives. He was a strict disciplinarian, constantly correcting my form. When I attempted a dive from the high board, I felt isolated and nervous but managed to jump, experiencing a brief sense of flight before an awkward entry into the water. Despite the instructor's disapproval, I felt euphoric. For most people, comfort and safety are priorities, so the behavior of adventurous travelers seems puzzling. These individuals embrace risks by climbing perilous mountains, sailing in fragile boats, and eating unconventional foods. They are often viewed as eccentrics, and while their existence is acknowledged, their lifestyle is dismissed as irrelevant by those who prefer the predictability of modern life. Jonathan Raban, a writer, admits to fearing the sea but sails to generate material for his writing. He is a capable sailor and uses electronic navigation aids, yet he criticizes the compass for altering the sailor's relationship with the sea. He argues that it has reduced the ocean to a mere space and allows for autopilots, giving him time to study the waves in detail."}

Culinary work offered an antidote to such intellectual and social affectations, promising a sense of seriousness and integrity.

Photography: Photography was developed in the 19th century by artists seeking a durable, accurate record of their visual environment. The combination of light, lens, shutter, and light-sensitive chemicals produced images that were more permanent, realistic, and detailed than what painters could achieve manually over weeks or months. This caused concern among other artists, and after initial appreciation, critics argued that photography could not be considered art because it was too tied to the real world"}

After they are in a newspaper for a day, week, or month, people forget them. Many people, including the writers, think reviewing is not important work. They believe people do it for money or because they cannot focus on bigger books. However, reviewing is a skilled job with different parts. Writing a short review of 600-800 words is different from a long one of 6000-8000 words. A medium review of 1500 words has its own challenges. The reviewer must consider the readers, from casual readers to experts. Reviewers need to know a lot and write in a way that smart people can understand and like. Often, reviewers write other things too. John Updike, an American novelist, does not think highly of criticism but still writes reviews. He puts his reviews in books to keep them. Others might want their reviews to last, especially if they think their best writing is in reviews. The author is a professor who writes academic books and reviews. In English-speaking countries, it is normal for the same people to do both. Before, other professors criticized this, but now it is accepted. This is good for readers because reviewers know their topic, and for professors because it keeps them sane and helps them communicate clearly. Reviewing should be a secondary job, as you need other work to do it well."}

Frank Kermode examines the craft of writing reviews from a practitioner's perspective. Most reviews are produced under conditions that give them a very short active life, with tight deadlines and length restrictions. Once published in a newspaper or magazine, they typically last only a day, week, or month. This ephemeral nature often leads to the belief that reviewing is not highly valued work; many assume reviewers do it for financial reasons or because they cannot dedicate time to more substantial writing like novels. Despite this, reviewing is a skilled and multi-faceted task. Writing a concise, fair review of 600-800 words differs from managing a detailed 6000-8000 word piece without losing coherence. A 1500-word review in a weekly magazine combines elements of both. Beyond length, reviewers must consider their audience, ranging from casual readers to those interested in in-depth analysis. They need broad knowledge and the ability to write prose that is understandable and enjoyable for intelligent readers. Consequently, reviewers often engage in other writing. For example, John Updike, an American novelist who views criticism as limited, still writes reviews and collects them in books. Similarly, the author, an academic, writes both scholarly books and reviews. In English-speaking cultures, it is common for the same individuals to do both, unlike in some other cultures. Previously, academics criticized this practice, but such complaints have decreased, partly due to more reviewing opportunities. This arrangement benefits readers by ensuring knowledgeable reviewers and helps professors stay grounded and communicate effectively. Ultimately, reviewing should be a secondary occupation, as it requires engagement in other work to be done well."}

Frank Kermode explores the art of review-writing from his own experience as a practitioner. Most reviews are composed and distributed under circumstances that ensure they have a brief active lifespan, constrained by deadlines and stringent length limits. Upon publication in periodicals, they occupy space only for the duration of the issue—a day, a week, or at most a month. This transient quality often defines the literary status of reviews, with many, including the public and reviewers themselves, supposing that reviewing is undertaken out of necessity, such as financial need or an inability to focus on more esteemed literary works. Nevertheless, reviewing is a skilled and complex profession. Crafting a bright, brisk, and fair review in 600-800 words is distinct from controlling a 6000-8000 word essay without argumentative looseness, while a 1500-word feature in weekly magazines presents hybrid challenges. Length is not the sole factor; reviewers must also assess their probable audience, from weekend skimmers to those seeking serious critique. Additionally, reviewers require extensive knowledge and the capacity to write prose that is both intelligible and engaging for discerning readers. It follows that reviewers typically produce other forms of writing. John Updike, the American novelist who regards criticism as inferior, still engages in reviewing and compiles his pieces into volumes. The author, primarily an academic, notes that in English-speaking societies, the sharp distinction between reviewing and literary study is absent, allowing the same individuals to pursue both. Past criticisms from academics about this practice have diminished, benefiting readers through informed reviewers and professors by maintaining their sanity and communication skills. Reviewing must remain a secondary occupation, as excellence in it depends on proficiency in other endeavors."}

Frank Kermode scrutinizes the craft of review-writing from a practitioner's standpoint. The majority of reviews are authored and disseminated under conditions that guarantee an exceedingly brief active existence, imposed by deadlines and rigorous constraints on length; once published, they claim relevance only for the lifespan of the periodical—be it a day, a week, or at most a month. Moreover, the literary standing of reviews is frequently determined by their ephemerality, with a common presumption, shared by the public and often the writers themselves, that reviewing is labor undertaken due to impediments such as financial shortfalls or an incapacity to devote time to more substantial literary projects. Yet, reviewing constitutes a skilled and multi-faceted occupation. It is one matter to be incisive, succinct, and summarily equitable within the 600-800 words of a standard newspaper review, and quite another to orchestrate, without discursive laxity, the 6000-8000 words occasionally permitted by international journals. The 1500-word leading article in weekly periodicals amalgamates the complexities of both concise and extensive formats. Length, however, is not the exclusive consideration; reviewers must deliberate on their anticipated readership, spanning from the casual weekend peruser to the individual sufficiently engaged to tackle a serious review-article. Furthermore, a reviewer necessitates broad erudition and the ability to compose prose that is comprehensible and pleasurable for intelligent audiences. Consequently, it is almost inevitable that the reviewer will be an individual who produces other literary works. John Updike, the American novelist who somewhat disparages criticism as 'hugging the shore,' nonetheless partakes in reviewing and assembles his pieces into volumes. The author, whose principal vocation is academic, observes that in Anglophone cultures, there is no analogous sharp demarcation between reviewing and literary scholarship, enabling the same persons to engage in both. Historical censures from academics have waned, and this configuration advantages readers by ensuring reviewer expertise and professors by fostering sanity and lucid communication. Ultimately, reviewing must be a secondary pursuit, as proficiency in it is contingent upon excellence in other domains."}

Our research began in 1978 with the aim of understanding why lions cooperate in hunting, rearing cubs, and deterring rivals with collective roars. If an animal's evolutionary success is judged by the number of surviving offspring, cooperation may not be advantageous if it involves excessive generosity. So, why do lions not adhere strictly to genetic self-interest? We initially assumed we could resolve this question within two to three years.

Lions are often regarded as archetypal social creatures, transcending minor conflicts to collaborate towards a common objective, such as securing sustenance. Nevertheless, after extensive observation in their natural habitat, we have cultivated a more modest assessment. Commencing our investigation in 1978, we aspired to elucidate the reasons behind lions' cooperative behaviors, including hunting, cub-rearing, and intimidating rivals with unified roars. If the ultimate measure of an animal's behavioral success is its lifetime production of surviving progeny, then altruistic cooperation may not be beneficial, as it can advantage others at one's own expense. Thus, why do the principles of evolutionary self-interest not seem to govern lions? We were confident that this issue could be resolved within two to three years. However, lions are remarkably indolent; akin to inert noble gases, they exhibit minimal activity. Therefore, a range of investigative techniques was employed to glean insights into feline behavior.

A sleep researcher says people need more sleep because they cut sleep when busy and wake up early to avoid traffic. In an experiment, people slept up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept 8.25 hours, showing they had a big need for sleep. In Europe, a university sleep lab in England tests sleep.

Sleep is called a way to pass time safely. In the past, people had two sleeps at night, waking for an hour in between. This time was for thinking or stealing, and poor people benefited. With artificial light, the rich started sleeping all night. Later, the industrial revolution made people work longer in lit buildings. In some non-western places, people still do not sleep all night due to noises or watching for dangers. People worldwide need more sleep."}

In Britain, recent best-selling novels have featured insomniacs as main characters or used sleep-research labs as settings. There is general interest in sleep, including its rhythms, functions, and disorders. A key concern is that people require more sleep; a leading researcher notes that individuals reduce sleep when busy, waking early to avoid rush hour traffic. In a recent experiment, subjects were allowed to sleep up to 14 hours nightly for a month. They took three weeks to stabilize at 8.25 hours, indicating a significant sleep deficit. In Europe, such ideas are tested at a university sleep laboratory in the English Midlands. This lab has studied fatigue's effects on sailors, airport noise impacts on sleep, and the dangers of motorway driving for tired drivers. Volunteers are recruited from student newspapers, transported by taxi, paid hourly, and instructed to adjust sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures them that electrodes on their heads do not reveal dreams or thoughts. The lab focuses on physical aspects, using a car simulator in a dark room where subjects drive on a projected road while answering questions, often arriving tired.

Beyond these findings, it is known that humans follow a daily sleep cycle with four stages from light to deep sleep. Dreams typically happen in light sleep, with body paralysis preventing injury. Theories propose that sleep repairs tissues or rests the brain, but this might occur during wakefulness, leaving uncertainties. Scientists are confident that women sleep 30 minutes longer than men and that older adults need less sleep, though reasons are unclear.

It is frequently asserted that fatigue characterizes the modern era. As affluent, industrious nations have expanded, insomnia and anxiety have similarly risen in the collective consciousness. Studies in the United States have revealed that 40 million Americans suffer chronically from sleep deprivation, while recent best-selling novels in Britain have portrayed insomniacs as protagonists or utilized sleep-research laboratories as backdrops. This interest encompasses sleep in general, including its cycles, purposes, and disturbances. A central issue is the need for more sleep; a prominent sleep researcher observes that people curtail sleep during busy periods, arising prematurely to evade rush hour congestion. In an experiment, participants were permitted to sleep up to 14 hours per night for a month. They required three weeks to attain a stable sleep duration of eight and a quarter hours, suggesting a substantial rebound effect from prior sleep loss. In Europe, such hypotheses are rigorously examined at a modest university sleep research facility in the English Midlands. This laboratory has investigated various topics, such as the impact of fatigue on sailors, the consequences of airport noise on sleepers, and the perils of motorway driving for weary drivers.

It is often contended that weariness has become emblematic of contemporary existence. As more prosperous and bustling nations have advanced, insomnia and disquiet have concurrently proliferated within the populace. Investigations in the United States have ascertained that 40 million Americans are chronically afflicted, whilst recent literary bestsellers in Britain have featured insomniacs as central figures or employed sleep-research laboratories as their milieus. This fascination pertains broadly to sleep, encompassing its rhythms, utilities, and pathologies. A predominant concern remains the insufficiency of sleep; a distinguished sleep researcher asserts that individuals curtail slumber during periods of busyness, rising unduly early to circumvent rush hour traffic. In a recent experimental undertaking, subjects were afforded the opportunity to sleep for up to 14 hours nightly over a month. They necessitated three weeks to achieve an equilibrium of eight and a quarter hours, indicative of a pronounced sleep rebound from prior deprivation. In Europe, such propositions are most assiduously evaluated at an unassuming university sleep research laboratory in the English Midlands. This institution has scrutinized, inter alia, the effects of fatigue on mariners, the impacts of airport acoustics on sleepers, and the hazards of motorway navigation for flagging drivers.

Early television consumption often occurred in public venues, as seen in the USA and Germany, posing a theoretical challenge to its domestication.

Initially, television was predominantly experienced in public exhibition contexts, notably in the United States and Germany, which could have posed a substantive challenge to its domestication. However, manufacturers, recognizing the lucrative prospects of mass-produced domestic receivers, catalyzed a shift towards home-centric consumption, facilitated by enhanced living standards and the intrinsic division between public and private spheres in modernity. Centralized broadcasting concomitantly served governmental objectives for efficient information dissemination and the fabrication of a unifying national imagined community, while also advancing democratic principles through equitable access to informational capital.

But if you make a mistake, things can go wrong. I avoid acting like an expert. For beginners, the best advice is to read widely, write often, and free your imagination in a helpful way. Some writers need a stable life to create poems. Others write to escape problems. Some follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All methods are valid if they are original. The key is to find your own voice, listen to it, and let it develop over time. The Short Story: In a short story, avoid too many characters, long descriptions, or extended flashbacks. Use brief memories only if necessary to explain the story's conflict. Dialogue is very useful because it shows different perspectives quickly and keeps the reader engaged without extra words. Do not overwrite, but do not make it too short like a summary. Keep the action and conflict strong in a limited space. Screenplays: Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Beginners often move without knowing the future. With experience, they learn to see the entire game and recognize patterns like openings and endings. Practice helps you understand the complexities. Looking at Writing: Charles Darwin said that speaking is natural for humans, as seen in children's babbling, but writing is not. All societies have language, and it does not get better over time. Children learn to speak easily without teaching. In contrast, writing was invented in few places and has improved slowly. Many children find it hard to learn, even with education. Children do not invent writing on their own; it must be taught carefully."}

Some individuals require stability to compose poetry, whereas others use writing as an outlet for distress. Certain writers adhere to routines, while others await moments of inspiration. All approaches are correct if they avoid imitation. The crucial aspect is discovering one's unique style, nurturing inner thoughts, and allowing them to mature independently. The Short Story: A short story must not be cluttered with excessive characters, lengthy narratives, or prolonged reflections. Flashbacks should be brief and employed only to illuminate key points, such as through a character's sudden memory that triggers the central conflict. Dialogue is highly effective, as it can reveal multiple viewpoints efficiently, maintain reader interest, and reduce verbosity. Overwriting can ruin a story, but brevity should not render it a mere outline. Conflict and action must be consistently developed within a concise format.

With practice, they identify patterns like gambits and phases of the game, enhancing their understanding of the craft's intricacies. Looking at Writing: Charles Darwin noted that humans have an innate capacity for speech, evident in children's chatter, but writing is not instinctive.

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about, but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. And since the atmosphere is intimately linked every aspect of the planet on which we live, any changes to climate will have significant knock-on effects for plants and animals, as well as water and soils. We humans have learned to use such natural resources to our advantage, enabling us to produce food, build great cities and support six billion members of the human race. Any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously. The problem we have is knowing just how the world will change, and what is causing these changes. There is no doubt, for example, that over the last 100 years or so, human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases -- which are closely related to global temperature. It seems likely that these increased concentrations, which are set to continue building up in the near future, are already affecting global climate, but our poor knowledge and understanding of the global heat balance make the current and future situations uncertain. What we do know is that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have fluctuated in close harmony with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years. This would indicate that the two are almost certainly related. Evidence gleaned from a range of sources suggests that our planet has warmed at the surface by about 6C over the past century. Most scientists think that this trend is unlikely to be natural in origin and is, in part, a result of human pollution of the atmosphere. A lot of research has gone into predicting the conditions that will result from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs known as general circulation models, or GCMs. They run on powerful computers, use fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to analyse the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation and other climatic factors to predict climatic condition for the past, present or future. Unfortunately, they are simplifications of the real would and have numerous deficiencies. Their results are only approximate and they are also slow to run and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system, although we do realise its complexity. ","target_text":"The Earth is getting warmer.

The intricate interdependence between the atmosphere and terrestrial systems means that climatic shifts will precipitate significant secondary effects on biological communities and abiotic resources. Human utilization of these natural resources underpins agricultural output, urban development, and the sustenance of vast populations, rendering any modifications a matter of grave concern. Indisputably, anthropogenic activities have augmented atmospheric concentrations of certain gases over the past century, which exhibit a strong correlation with global thermal readings.

Notwithstanding these limitations, projections indicate an average surface temperature increase of 1°C to 3.5°C by 2100, a sea level rise of 15-95 cm, and a heightened incidence of extreme weather events. Such changes could reconfigure ecological distributions, compromise the integrity of forests and grasslands, and imperil the resources essential for societal continuity, including food security and hydrological supplies. In Australia, for example, elevated minimum temperatures have contributed to augmented wheat yields by reducing frost frequency. However, in arid and semi-arid regions, diminished precipitation exacerbates water shortages, as observed in the Mediterranean Basin where seasonal rainfall patterns have shifted. Additionally, glacial degradation may impact cryospheric elements, facilitating maritime activities in the Arctic yet increasing iceberg perils.

The integration of astronomical concepts and expanded global knowledge from exploration prompted endeavors to map the known world, while the recognition of Earth's oblate spheroid shape introduced refinements for large-scale mapping.

Subsequently, specialists including archaeologists, historians, and geographers imposed unique requirements, compelling contemporary cartographers to devise methods for mapping diverse distributions, from geological strata to climatic regimes. This widespread acknowledgment of maps' utility in coordinating and interpreting multifarious scientific phenomena has engendered a veritable renaissance in cartography. Nonetheless, it would be erroneous to depict this evolution as linear or uninterrupted; periods of retrogression or stagnation have occurred, during which obsolete ideas persisted alongside novel ones.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: 0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian's social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia ('times were good then'), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question. Animal Science There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, that is, in how the nerves, muscles and sense organs are coordinated to produce complex behaviour.

Within the 'whole animal' approach, a distinction is often made between psychologists and ethologists.

{"input_text":"simplify to A2: 0ral History The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian's social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia ('times were good then'), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life.

Animal Science: There are two main approaches in animal science: physiology and the whole animal approach. Physiologists study how the body's parts like nerves and muscles work together. The whole animal approach focuses on behavior and its causes. Psychologists and ethologists are part of this; psychologists study learning in labs, while ethologists observe natural behavior. Today, these groups collaborate more. Even with detailed body knowledge, behavior must be studied on its own level. The Social Sciences: Students of social sciences must learn both the content and the methods of their subject. This includes understanding research findings and how knowledge is gathered. Social sciences go beyond common sense by using specific concepts and methods for each discipline, like sociology or psychology.

It is incorrect to assume that an informant's testimony is an exact account of past events, as the interview process affects both parties. The historian's role in selecting the informant and setting the topic influences the narrative, and the informant's memories can be altered by external sources like media or emotional factors such as nostalgia or grievance. Consequently, historians must acknowledge their part in shaping this evidence. Animal Science: Animal science is divided into physiological and whole animal approaches. Physiologists investigate how bodily systems coordinate to produce behavior, while those in the whole animal approach study the behavior of intact animals and its influencing factors. Traditionally, psychologists focused on laboratory studies of learning in species like rats, whereas ethologists examined innate behaviors in natural settings. Although distinctions remain, there is now productive integration between these fields. Physiologists claim their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior requires analysis at the behavioral level, not just cellular details. The Social Sciences: Students entering social sciences face the dual task of mastering the subject's content and its methodology. This involves familiarizing themselves with research findings and the logical foundations of how knowledge is acquired and organized. While social life is familiar from daily experience, social sciences employ specialized concepts and methods that surpass common sense, defining each discipline's unique approach. Classical Architecture: In classical antiquity, architecture encompassed more than construction; it emphasized aesthetic principles such as order, arrangement, and proportion, as outlined by Vitruvius. Although functional aspects were addressed, the artistic elements took precedence. The origins trace back to simple hut dwellings, whose basic forms persisted and evolved into the elaborate designs of classical temples."}

It is naive to believe that testimony provides an unadulterated record of past experiences, as the dynamic of the interview affects both the historian and the informant. The historian's selection process and analytical framework shape the evidence, and the informant's recollections may be compromised by influences from media, nostalgic idealization, or later-emerged grievances. Thus, historians bear responsibility for their role in evidence creation, and the informant's memories are not directly linked to the past but filtered through subsequent experiences. Animal Science: In animal science, two primary approaches exist: the physiological, which examines the coordination of nerves, muscles, and sense organs in behavior, and the whole animal approach, which studies behavior in its entirety and its determinants. Within the latter, psychologists traditionally investigate learning in controlled environments with specific species, while ethologists focus on innate behaviors in natural habitats. Although these distinctions persist, there is now a beneficial convergence. Physiologists emphasize the fundamentality of their methods, yet behavioral analysis remains essential, as behavior possesses its own organizational units that cannot be fully explained at the cellular level. The Social Sciences: Students of social sciences must concurrently acquaint themselves with the subject's substantive content and its methodological foundations. This entails understanding both empirical findings and the logical principles underlying knowledge acquisition and organization. Despite the familiarity of social phenomena, social sciences transcend common sense through discipline-specific concepts and methods, which facilitate deeper insights and distinguish one field from another. Classical Architecture: In the classical world, architecture was defined by aesthetic principles such as order, arrangement, proportion, and symmetry, as per Vitruvius, who prioritized artistic elements over mere utility. While functional considerations were later incorporated, the emphasis remained on art.

It is erroneous to presume that an individual's testimony constitutes a pristine distillation of historical experience, given that the interview scenario mutually influences both participants. The historian's prerogative in selecting informants and delineating topics, coupled with their analytical paradigms, impinges upon the narrative, while the informant's memories may be adulterated by extraneous sources such as media or distorted by affective residues like nostalgia or grievances that crystallized post-factum. Consequently, historians must concede their complicity in the genesis of evidence, and the informant's recollections are not in immediate contact with the past but are mediated by subsequent psychological developments. Animal Science: Animal science is characterized by two principal methodologies: the physiological approach, which probes the mechanistic coordination of neural, muscular, and sensory components in comportment, and the whole animal approach, which scrutinizes the behavior of intact organisms and its modulators. Traditionally, psychologists have concentrated on associative learning in laboratory settings with constrained species, whereas ethologists have prioritized instinctive behaviors in ecological contexts. Although vestiges of this dichotomy endure, a synergistic amalgamation has emerged. Physiologists tout the fundamentality of their techniques, yet comprehending behavior necessitates examination at its own hierarchical level, as it embodies organizational structures irreducible to neurocellular operations. The Social Sciences: Novitiates in social sciences confront the exigency of assimilating both the epistemological content and the methodological underpinnings of their discipline. This involves acquainting themselves with extant research and the logical frameworks governing knowledge synthesis. While quotidian experiences render social phenomena seemingly intuitive, social sciences eclipse common sense through specialized conceptual apparatuses and investigatory methods, which not only facilitate transcending mundane understanding but also demarcate disciplinary boundaries.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Vervet monkeys Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger's intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. If he succeeded, it was more than likely that the incumbent male would be ousted from his position of privilege. With the vervet equivalent of a stroke of genius, the male hit on the ideal ploy to keep the stranger away from his group. As soon as the strange male descended from the grove of trees to try to cross the open ground that separated his grove from the one in which the group was feeding, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to signal the sighting of a leopard nearby. The stranger shot back into the safety of his trees. As the day wore on, this was repeated every time the stranger made a move in the groups direction. All was going swimmingly until the male made a crucial mistake: after successfully using the ploy several times, he gave the leopard alarm call while himself nonchalantly walking across open ground. What Cats Catch In a recent survey, people in the 173-household English village of Felmersham collected their cats' prey. Over one year their seventy cats produced over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America saw these figures and worked out that on this basis the cat population of Britain must be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year! The mesmeric effect of big numbers seems to have stultified reason. It is not realistic just to multiply the number of catches of these rural cats by the entire cat population of Britain. Most cats are town cats with small ranges, and catch fewer items of prey than the cats in this survey. The key question should have been this: are the numbers sustainable? The answer would seem to be yes. In winter many householders feed birds, while garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, and in this way the bird population is kept at well above 'natural' levels. The survey found that the cat is a significant predator, but not that it is devastating Britain's bird population.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Paul Simon Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult, but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols, who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange, unsettling sound would somehow, irrevocably, be linked with their destinies. For Paul Simon, as for other youngsters in the US, the chief opportunity for hearing this new and invigorating type of music that was sweeping the country was courtesy of Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was required listening for a whole generation of fledgling rock idols.

Dr. Gray is now rich. Dione has her own company. The book helps people talk better. Many people want to get better, so they buy these books. This helps the book industry. In Britain, some self-help books are not good. For every book published, many are not chosen. Editors want books that sell. They ask: Is the author famous? Is the idea good? A good title is very important. Autobiographies: When someone writes about their life, they should tell the truth. But often, they do not. They might not tell bad things. They might think some things are not important. Sometimes, they make up stories to show the truth better. Or they say it is true when it is not. This can make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: These stories are popular. They show problems in society. The crime is like bad human feelings. Solving the crime makes society better. In Hammett's stories, society is still bad. The detective and the criminal are similar. The detective is not all good or all bad. He understands criminals. This makes his job hard. Science writing: Stephen Jay Gould is a great science writer. I met him in a hotel. We did not like it there. He said writers must know the culture they write about.

In Britain, self-help books can be silly, but many are rejected for being unoriginal. Editors look for books that will sell well. They consider if the author is promotable and if the idea is universal. A catchy title is very helpful in reaching people. Autobiographies: There is an agreement that autobiographers should tell the truth, but this is often not fully followed. Writers might omit shameful actions or thoughts, or leave out things they think are unimportant. Sometimes, they break the agreement in more complex ways. They might invent stories to show the truth more clearly than facts can. Or, they might call the book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is fiction. This can happen without bad intentions. Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: Experts say detective stories grew from societal conflicts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The stories are allegories where crimes represent human impulses like lust or greed. Solving the crime restores order to society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown as corrupt. The detective and criminal are two sides of the same person. The detective understands criminals and is partly like them, making his role ambiguous and his mission complicated.

Autobiographies: There is an implicit pact between autobiographers and readers that the truth will be told, but this is rarely fully honored. Writers may omit actions or thoughts they find too shameful or unimportant. More interestingly, they might break the pact by inventing stories that better convey the truth than strict facts would, or by labeling fiction as autobiography to gain readers' trust. This can lead naive readers to believe they have read a true account, even if it is entirely fabricated, and it may not be done cynically.

These stories serve as allegories, with crimes symbolizing innate human impulses like lust or greed, and their resolution restoring social order. In Hammett's work, however, society is depicted as inherently corrupt. The detective and criminal represent two aspects of the same personality, with the detective straddling both worlds.

His concise volume on bridging communication gaps between the sexes epitomizes the vast and expanding self-help industry, which purportedly addresses numerous American aspirations for betterment. Concurrently, it capitalizes on these yearnings, generates additional ones, and sustains the New York publishing sector. In Britain, the genre often features melodramatic and dubious titles, though many are worse. For each self-help book published, thousands are dismissed as overly derivative or specialized. As a new class of influential editor-agents seeks the next popular hit, literary quality is overlooked in favor of marketability. Key considerations include the author's promotability, the conceptual hook, and universality, with a compelling title being a significant advantage in engaging audiences. Autobiographies: An implicit understanding exists between autobiographers and readers that the narrative will be truthful, yet this pact is seldom entirely upheld. Authors may exclude actions or reflections deemed too humiliating or trivial. More nuanced reasons for deviation include fabricating anecdotes that encapsulate truths more effectively than factual accuracy or deliberately labeling a work as autobiography to foster reader credulity. This can result in unsuspecting readers accepting a fictional account as veracious, a practice not necessarily rooted in cynicism. Dashiell Hammett's detective stories: Analysts of the detective genre attribute its proliferation to the tensions within late 19th and early 20th century society. Essentially allegorical, these stories use crime to symbolize fundamental human drives such as lust or greed, with the resolution traditionally signifying societal reintegration and suppression of unlawful impulses. Hammett's unique approach, however, reveals society as corrupt even after order is restored.

There may be things he decides against putting down on paper because (as he rationalises) they are not important enough. There are also more complex and interesting reasons for surreptitiously breaking the pact. The autobiographer may decide that the ultimate goal","target_text":"Self-help books: While serving as an editor at Random House in New York, Dione Reverend first perused a manuscript by the hitherto obscure pop psychologist Dr. John Gray. She discerned from the title alone that it would ascend to the pinnacle of bestseller lists, a conviction that materialized accurately. Dr. Gray has since become a multimillionaire, and Reverend has established her own enterprise. His slender treatise on ameliorating intersexual communication deficits functions as the unofficial emblem of an extensive and burgeoning self-help industry, which ostensibly caters to America's multifarious aspirations for enhancement. Nevertheless, it also preys upon these yearnings, engenders further desires, and, not incidentally, buttresses the entirety of New York's publishing domain. In Britain, the genre can inundate shelves with volumes as quackish and histrionic as their covers, though inferior examples abound. For every self-help title that reaches publication, multitudes are spurned for excessive derivativeness or overspecialization. As a novel breed of heavyweight editor-cum-agent pursues the next lightweight blockbuster, prose style is the least of considerations; marketability predominates. Inquiries into an author's promotability, the conceptual 'hook,' and universality are paramount, with a resonant title constituting a substantial portion of the competitive edge in audience engagement. Autobiographies: A tacit compact necessitates that autobiographers relate veracious accounts to their readership, yet this covenant is infrequently observed in its entirety. Omissions may arise from actions or cogitations deemed too ignominious for public disclosure or rationalized as insufficiently significant. More intricate and compelling rationales for surreptitious breaches include contriving narratives that distill truth more elegantly and pointedly than rigid adherence to facts permits, or, from the outset, eschewing veracity entirely by designating a work as autobiography to cultivate a reservoir of credulity in the reader. This stratagem can endure throughout the narrative, leaving ingenuous readers convinced of its historicity despite its fictional nature, all"}

Paradoxically, the perceived significance of marketing escalated during this period, as companies increasingly adopted customer-centric approaches, thereby enhancing the stature of marketing personnel while augmenting their responsibilities. Clients subjected advertising to rigorous scrutiny, questioning its efficacy and insisting on enhanced strategic precision and creativity.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Food There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know I may be preaching to the converted, because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one, but so often we imagine that, unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish, it is hardly worth attempting. Not so. Just by throwing a few roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery and a few herbs into water you will get the most delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a tin. Instead of buying an over-sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, emulsifiers and additives, in five minutes you can turn out the most delicious confection that both grown-ups and children will love. Cooking is also an offering, and it is a gesture of care and love to bring once own creation, however humble or simple, to the table. Sharing food is so rich in symbolism, of our deepest human needs, that it is hardly surprising all our festivities and celebrations take place around tables, be they birthdays, anniversaries, engagements or whatever! No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! Nor would many people wish to have a business deal discussed over tinned soup.

Although many believe cooking is only for special occasions, it is often simple and worthwhile. For instance, combining roughly chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water can produce a delicious soup, which is more satisfying than processed options. Similarly, a homemade chocolate mousse without preservatives can be made quickly and enjoyed by all. Cooking acts as an offering, expressing care and love through even humble dishes. Sharing meals is symbolic of human needs, which is why celebrations such as birthdays and anniversaries revolve around dining together; takeaway food is unsuitable for such events. In the elevator, Alistair reflected on his disorganized office, cluttered with correspondence, tax forms, and books. He anticipated Mallory's punctual arrival and her likely disapproval of the mess. Earlier, Mrs. Wilson, his cleaner, had refused to enter the office, viewing Alistair as an outsider from another place. Karen's desire to differ from her mother shaped her personal story. A key moment occurred at age twelve when her brother struck her eye with a golf club. Initially fearing blindness, she was relieved that the bone had shielded her eye, leaving only minor scars. In the doctor's office, seeing her mother speak of miracles reinforced Karen's sense of purpose. Miss Fogerty returned from an event feeling both excited and sorrowful. She was thrilled to be among the first to learn significant news in her small community, but overwhelmed with grief over Dr. Bailey's condition. As her long-time doctor, he had always shown genuine interest in her health issues, like her annual laryngitis, and his willingness to listen had earned him deep affection from everyone."}

While it might seem that cooking is reserved for elaborate dishes or special events, this is not the case; even a simple soup made from roughly chopped carrots, leek, celery, and herbs can be immensely satisfying and superior to commercial products. Likewise, creating a homemade chocolate mousse free from additives in just five minutes provides a delightful treat for both adults and children. Cooking serves as an act of offering, embodying care and love through one's creations, no matter how modest. The symbolism of sharing food reflects core human needs, explaining why festivities like birthdays and anniversaries are centered around meals, where takeaway or canned options are deemed inappropriate. In the elevator, Alistair contemplated his office's disorder, with correspondence littering surfaces and tax forms overflowing from drawers. He expected Mallory to arrive precisely on time, given her compulsiveness about punctuality and neatness, and considered how she might react to the chaos. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaner, had earlier declined to tidy the office, perceiving Alistair as an alien figure from beyond her familiar Brooklyn world. Karen's aspiration to distinguish herself from her mother led her to craft a personal mythology of strength. A pivotal incident at age twelve involved her brother accidentally hitting her eye with a golf club; though she initially feared blindness, the bone had protected her eye, resulting only in stitches that healed into a faint reminder. Upon seeing her mother in the doctor's office, Karen felt destined for a greater purpose. Miss Fogerty, returning across the village green, experienced a mix of excitement and sadness. She was exhilarated to be privy to noteworthy information in her quiet community, yet profoundly grieved by Dr. Bailey's condition. Having been her physician for years, he consistently demonstrated a valuable quality: making patients feel he had ample time to address their fears and perplexities, which endeared him to the village through his generosity and humor."}

I acknowledge that I may be addressing an audience already convinced, as those interested in cooking likely purchase books such as this, yet we often erroneously assume that unless it is a special occasion or an intricate dish, cooking is scarcely worth the effort. This is a misconception; merely by combining roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery, and a few herbs in water, one can produce a most delicious soup, far more rewarding than resorting to packaged or tinned alternatives. Similarly, instead of consuming an oversweet chocolate mousse laden with preservatives, emulsifiers, and additives, in a mere five minutes one can create a delectable confection adored by both adults and children.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. In common conception, the work of art is often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. Since the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience, the result is not favourable to understanding. In addition, the very perfection of some of these products, the prestige they possess because of a long history of unquestioned admiration, creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When an art product once attains classic status, it somehow becomes isolated from the human conditions under which it was brought into being and from the human consequences it engenders in actual life experience. When artistic objects are separated from both conditions of origin and operation in experience, a wall is built around them that renders almost opaque their general significance, with which aesthetic theory deals. Art is remitted to a separate realm, where it is cut off from that association with the materials and aims of every other form of human effort and achievement. A primary task is thus imposed upon one who undertakes to write upon the philosophy of the fine arts. This task is to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings that are universally recognised to constitute experience. Mountain peaks do not float unsupported, they do not even just rest upon the earth. They are the earth in one of its manifest operations. It is the business of those who are concerned with the theory of the earth, geographers and geologists, to make this fact evident in its various implications. The theorist who would deal philosophically with fine art has a like task to accomplish. If one is willing to grant this position, even if only by way of temporary experiment, one will see that there follows a conclusion which is at first sight surprising. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time, to turn aside from them and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour.","target_text":"Aesthetics is about art and beauty. Art is made by people. But sometimes, people think art is only the thing you see, like a painting or a building. This makes it hard to understand art. Art should be part of our daily life.

Ironically, the very existence of artworks, upon which aesthetic theory is based, can become an impediment to that theory, as these works are often perceived merely as external, physical entities divorced from human experience. This misconception arises because the actual work of art is defined by its interaction within experience, not its standalone existence. Furthermore, the perfection and historical prestige of certain art products establish conventions that inhibit novel insights; when an artwork achieves classic status, it becomes isolated from its human conditions of creation and its consequences in lived experience. Such separation constructs a barrier that obscures art's broader significance, relegating it to a detached realm. Thus, a fundamental obligation for those engaged in the philosophy of fine arts is to reestablish continuity between the intensified experiences of art and the mundane events that constitute ordinary life. For instance, mountains are not floating entities but are integral operations of the earth, much as art should be viewed in relation to daily existence. To grasp artistic meaning, one must occasionally disregard the artworks themselves and recourse to commonplace experiential forces, undertaking a theoretical detour. Many contemporary arts with vitality, like cinema or jazz, are not conventionally recognized as such, as art is often confined to institutional settings. True appreciation flourishes when distinguished objects are intimately linked with the products of everyday endeavors."}

This doesn't mean the original was unnecessary; it's about how books and films require different kinds of attention from the audience. In novels, redundancy helps understanding, like repeating character traits or using 'he said' to show who is speaking. In stage plays, dialogue often includes extra words that don't add meaning, just to keep conversation going. Watching movies can transport you to another world, making you feel part of the story and free from everyday life. When the film ends, the feeling stops, and you don't feel responsible for that time. Some people, like teachers in the past, thought movies were only entertainment, not art. The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings that were confusing to navigate. There were three main entrances, all similar, with no information desk. Strangers found it hard, but employees knew their way. Together, they created films that provided escape from daily troubles. Many people dream of making movies. They use guidebooks and take courses. Robert Rodriguez made a low-budget film called El Mariachi and became a famous director quickly. He aimed to succeed young, like Orson Welles. In the old days, filmmakers learned over time by working on smaller projects, but now they often have to be independent."}

Adapting novels for film typically involves reducing, condensing, or deleting content. This process can be frustrating for authors, yet it can also provide insights. When I worked on a script, I realized that much of the dialogue and narrative from the novel could be omitted while still communicating the same ideas. This isn't because the original material was unnecessary; rather, it relates to the different ways novels and films engage their audiences and use redundancy. In this context, redundancy doesn't mean something useless but refers to technical elements that aid comprehension. For instance, in novels, redundancy includes repeated references to character traits or speech tags like 'he said', which make reading smoother. In stage drama, dialogue often mimics real speech with redundant, phatic language that serves to maintain contact between characters without conveying much meaning. Watching movies can be an immersive experience, making viewers feel detached from reality and absorbed in the film's world. After the movie ends, this spell breaks, and people may not take the experience seriously, reflecting past views that movies were mere entertainment rather than art. The Leiper Film Company studios consisted of many disparate buildings with an irrational layout. It had few permanent landmarks and numerous identical rooms, identified by a confusing system of codes. There were three main entrances, none with information points, making it difficult for strangers to navigate. However, employees could find their way, and through their work, they produced films that offered audiences a temporary escape from life's challenges. Nowadays, many aspire to make films, utilizing how-to books and university courses. Robert Rodriguez, for example, used a low-cost camera to make El Mariachi, which launched his career as an independent director. He felt pressure to achieve success early, unlike in the past when filmmakers matured slowly through roles like editing or cinematography."}

On the few","target_text":"Fashion is frequently perceived as a contemporary development heavily reliant on capitalism from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; however, most fashion historians stress that fashion, in terms of style and design, possesses a lengthy historical lineage, often commencing with the expansion of market trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have evolved in complexity, populations have increased, and diverse technologies for creating clothing and adornments have emerged, the significances attached to attire have likewise become more multifaceted and consequential. Thus, it is presently difficult to ascertain with certainty the precise meaning of any garment or accessory; for example, a man's suit, while ostensibly symbolizing uniformity, actually communicates highly variable meanings across different contexts and to different individuals. Writer: Media depictions of publishers engaging in bidding wars over promising manuscripts have fostered a distorted impression of the typical novelist's life. At the less lucrative end of the spectrum, authors sustain themselves through two primary means: the more prudent write during evenings while holding stable full-time employment, whereas others, like myself, function as literary freelancers, surviving on intermittent teaching, workshops, and articles. Although I have encountered opportunities such as in-house writing roles, I have not secured them; nonetheless, by balancing part-time work, credit, and often the generosity acknowledged in book dedications, I succeed in completing novels. Sudden Fame: Our ascent to stardom was abrupt, with small venues selling out and additional bouncers required to manage throngs of screaming fans. We resorted to covert entrances to avoid being mobbed, and on off-nights, venturing outdoors invariably led to being chased by devoted followers. We were catapulted into celebrity status, with our actions scrutinized and all necessities attended to by management and associates. Despite my persistent shyness, it was supplanted by a peculiar, naive overconfidence typical of introverts thrust into such scenarios, leaving me emotionally out of my depth."}

Nonetheless, the majority of fashion historians are meticulous in highlighting that fashion, at least in the context of style and design, boasts a considerable historical trajectory, frequently initiating with the proliferation of market economies and mercantile trade during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have advanced in intricacy, populations have burgeoned, and multifarious technologies for fabricating an expanding array of clothing and personal adornments have been devised, the connotations associated with attire have concomitantly escalated in complexity and import. Consequently, it is presently arduous to assert with any certitude the definitive meaning of any sartorial item or embellishment; for instance, a man's suit, purportedly emblematic of utmost uniformity, in fact conveys profoundly disparate significances across varied contexts and to distinct observers. Writer: Newspaper accounts of publishers embroiled in competitive bidding for prodigious manuscripts have engendered a skewed conception of the average novelist's existence. In the less illustrious echelons of the profession—where best-seller status is elusive—there exist two predominant methods of financial sustenance: the more sagacious authors compose during nocturnal hours whilst maintaining other full-time occupations that provide stability irrespective of the book's immediate commercial success, whereas individuals such as myself operate as literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a mélange of teaching engagements, sporadic workshops, and journalistic contributions. I have been apprised of in-house writing opportunities, such as those proffered by a chocolate manufacturer, yet I have never succeeded in securing analogous positions. Nevertheless, through the diligent juggling of part-time employments and credit facilities, and frequently owing to the benevolence of those acknowledged in dedications, the novel is ultimately brought to fruition.

This display traces the history of such art in the 20th century, showing that creating moving or movement-themed artworks has been a persistent, though often overlooked, aspect of modern creativity. Curator Guy Brett, a lifelong scholar, has assembled a diverse collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films, presented with little textual intervention to encourage visitors' personal exploration and discovery.\", 'David Hockney': \"David Hockney's work appeals broadly, even to those with limited interest in art, perhaps due to its figurative nature and themes of leisure that provide an escape from mundane reality. Some are captivated by his witty personality rather than his art itself. While respected critics deem him a minor artist, Hockney contends that his popularity does not negate substance, and he is realistic about his artistic stature, leaving final judgement to future generations.\", 'Window-shopping - an art exhibition': \"Having attended many contemporary art exhibitions, I became frustrated with those imposing a unified agenda. In response, I curated 'Window-shopping' in a vacant warehouse with seven artists, featuring individual works linked solely by their definition as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy railway, while Matthew Crawley's manipulated video camera broke down on screen. These disparate pieces did not conform to a thematic exhibition but gained mutual enrichment through their contrasts, avoiding grandiose claims about art practice.\", 'Art History': 'Art enthusiasts often avoid analysing paintings to preserve the richness of their immediate experience, and art historians are sometimes accused of ignoring aesthetic pleasure in pursuit of theoretical insights. Yet, understanding an artwork can enhance enjoyment, as pleasure is not merely instinctive but influenced by historical and societal contexts. While sensuous responses are vital, the idea that intellectual analysis detracts from them is an outdated notion that separated art from thought.'"}

A small brown wren is repeatedly hitting a greenhouse window. Could it be conveying a message from a mystical realm, or is it merely trapped? Both interpretations might be valid. Wrens have been woven into British culture since its beginnings. In medieval times, complex systems involved observing wren flight directions to predict luck. Today, wrens are depicted in household art and ceramics. Although early beliefs have faded, wrens still occupy a place in our consciousness and affections. A woodland devoid of wrens seems desolate and deprived. This stems from a rich tradition of folklore in our relationships with birds, dating back to eras when people interpreted nature differently for survival. They developed ecological and cultural languages to communicate the significance of creatures, though this significance shifts with cultural changes. A notable example is the red kite: in the 16th century, it was a protected urban scavenger in London, taking bread from children, but it later came to be viewed as vermin and was eradicated in most areas except Wales. Over time, it gained a romantic association with Celtic regions and is now a totem of conservation efforts, being reintroduced to restore its range. Our bond with birds extends beyond culture to human evolution. Early birdwatchers keenly observed bird behavior for warnings of predators, weather, and food, as well as spiritual connections.

A diminutive brown wren is persistently striking a greenhouse pane; might it be articulating an omen from the fringes of imagination, or is it simply an unfortunate bird ensnared? Both perspectives could hold truth. Wrens have been integral to the fabric of British culture since its inception. During medieval epochs, intricate systems of augury involved interpreting the flight paths of wrens to foretell fortune. In contemporary times, the wren's image endures in domestic art and pottery. Even as primordial convictions have attenuated or been forgotten, the wren retains a foothold in our collective psyche and a niche in our emotional attachments. A sylvan environment bereft of wrens is a melancholy and impoverished locale. This phenomenon likely arises from a rich vein of folklore permeating our avian relationships, hearkening back to an era when humanity deciphered the natural world through a different lens, necessitated by direct reliance on ecological processes for survival. This fostered the development of an ecological and cultural lexicon through which the import of other species was conveyed—a significance susceptible to cultural transformations that alter perceptions. The red kite exemplifies this: in the early 16th century, it was a safeguarded urban scavenger in London, astonishing visitors by seizing bread from children, yet it soon became vilified as vermin and was extirpated from most regions save Wales.

{"input_text":"simplify to C1: Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports There's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird, a bird of portent, augury and divination. Is it spelling out some sort of message from a world at the very edges of my imagination? Or is it just a poor bird stuck in a greenhouse? Depending on your point of view, both could be true. Wrens have been flitting through the undergrowth of British culture ever since it began. In medieval times, a complicated system of observing the directions in which wrens flew determined the sort of luck the observer would experience. In modern times, the image of the wren remains in pictures and ceramics in many British households. Even though the early beliefs may have been watered down or even forgotten, the wren still has a perch in our consciousness and a nest in our affections. A wood without wrens is a sad, impoverished place. This is almost certainly because there is a rich vein of folklore running through our relationships with many birds which reaches back to a time when people read the world around them differently. Where people are, necessarily, hitched more directly to natural processes for their very survival, they develop an ecological and cultural language through which the significance of other creatures is communicated. This significance is, of course, prone to cultural shifts that cause major image changes for the creatures involved. A good example of this is the red kite. During the early sixteenth century, foreign visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take bread from the hands of children. These birds were protected and valued urban scavengers. But it was not long before they began to be seen as vermin, and as a result were soon wiped out in most areas apart from Wales. Gradually red kites began to assume a romantic personality linked to this Celtic stronghold and they have now become totemic birds of British conservation, protected again and reintroduced with a view to","target_text":"Human culture has invariably expressed profound affections, fears, and devotions towards birds, which in turn reflects intrinsic aspects of our own identity. A diminutive brown wren is repeatedly colliding with a greenhouse window; could it be conveying a portent from the peripheries of imagination, or is it merely an entrapped avian? Both interpretations may hold validity. Wrens have been perennially embedded in the undergrowth of British culture since its dawn. In medieval times, elaborate systems of augury involved scrutinizing the trajectories of wren flight to divine the observer's fortune. In the modern era, the wren's visage persists in domestic iconography and ceramics. Although archaic beliefs may have attenuated or dissipated, the wren still occupies a perch in our collective consciousness and a nest in our affections. A woodland devoid of wrens is a lamentably impoverished space. This is likely attributable to a rich vein of folklore that permeates our relationships with numerous birds, tracing back to epochs when humanity interpreted the natural world through a distinct paradigm, necessitated by a direct tether to ecological processes for survival. This engendered an ecological and cultural lexicon through which the significance of other creatures is communicated—a significance prone to cultural shifts that precipitate substantial image alterations. The red kite serves as a salient illustration: during the early sixteenth century, it was a protected urban scavenger in London, astonishing foreign visitors by swooping to procure bread from children's hands, yet it soon became stigmatized as vermin and was consequently eradicated from most locales except Wales. Gradually, the red kite assumed a romantic persona associated with this Celtic bastion and has now become a totemic symbol of British conservation, being reintroduced with the objective of restoring its ancestral distribution.

The deliberate pace of handwriting imposes cognitive discipline, fostering careful composition, in contrast to the casual facility of word processors, which often results in negligence and protracted revisions. Although email has rejuvenated the art of personal correspondence, it tends to be emotionally ponderous and susceptible to hyperbole, diminishing the nuanced character of handwritten missives. Compact discs, with their single-sided playback, represent an advance in audio technology, though their design invites scrutiny regarding potential enhancements. In the realm of text, books remain preferable for sustained reading, as electronic media encourage superficial engagement rather than comprehensive absorption, a phenomenon exacerbated by chronocentric rhetoric that overstates technological shifts.

For me, photographs transcend mere livelihood; they are an integral aspect of my existence. The interplay of light on surfaces consistently sparks my imagination, and the capacity of a single snapshot to capture the quintessence of a moment, location, or individual is deeply ingrained in my consciousness. I perpetually aspire to capture the perfect photograph, maintaining my camera ready and remaining vigilant. On one occasion, I came close with an image of a peculiarly shaped smoke plume from a burning oil well, which garnered international attention in newspapers and magazines—a fleeting glory born from serendipity. Subsequently, I transitioned to freelance work, which should have been advantageous, but extraneous life circumstances impeded my anticipated triumphs in the mid-nineties, leading me to Vienna for this assignment. This opportunity arose fortuitously after I contributed to a co-published picture book on European cities; when the Austrian photographer withdrew, I was selected as a replacement due to the publishers' appreciation of my previous work and my availability. I accepted readily, as my domestic situation was unsatisfactory. Accommodated in a hotel in the historic center, I reflected on a prior visit to Vienna with my wife, which had been a crowded and unmemorable summer excursion. Alone in the austere January cold, I immediately sensed a difference and felt optimistic about producing exceptional photographs. I spent the initial day acclimating to the city via tram rides, observing the steadfast, frozen ambiance reminiscent of the bygone empire. I bided my time, awaiting propitious moments. At dawn the following day, I ventured to a snow-covered square to photograph the cathedral, though its monumental scale posed a compositional challenge. Photography retains an element of enchantment for me, a perennial mystery that persists despite technical comprehension, which perhaps accounts for my lack of astonishment at the events that unfolded that morning."}

The manner in which illumination interacts with surfaces perpetually stimulates my creative faculties, and the potential for a solitary image to encapsulate the intrinsic nature of a temporal and spatial context, a metropolis, or an individual is profoundly embedded within my psyche. I am ceaselessly in pursuit of the quintessential photograph, operating under the principle of perpetual readiness and acute observation. On a prior occasion, I approximated this ideal with a photograph of an anomalously configured smoke plume emanating from a combusting oil well, which precipitated its adoption by periodicals globally—an ephemeral acclaim derived from a transient instance of fortune. Following this, I embarked upon a freelance career, a decision that ostensibly should have yielded success, yet was undermined by vicissitudes in my personal life, thus accounting for my presence in Vienna rather than a more conspicuous locale. This engagement materialized serendipitously subsequent to my involvement in a lavishly illustrated tome detailing European cities across seasons; upon the departure of the designated Austrian photographer, I was enlisted as a substitute, owing to the publishers' approbation of my oeuvre and my unencumbered schedule. I acquiesced with alacrity, motivated by adverse circumstances domestically. Residing at a hotel in the ancient city's core, I reminisced about a previous sojourn with my spouse, which had been a frenetic and ultimately forgettable summer itinerary. In solitude during the rigorous January chill, I immediately discerned a transformative potential and anticipated both personal gratification and the creation of distinguished imagery. I devoted the inaugural day to perambulating the city via tram, assimilating the immutable, frigid atmosphere that echoed the grandiose remnants of a defunct empire.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Amateur Astronomy Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production, and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results. All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too. Too Much Choice Society is becoming 'overchoiced'. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins. Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess.

This happens when actors talk about their work in interviews. They should say what a dancer once said: 'If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it.' But actors often use boring or silly words. We should listen to what actor Paul Scofield said. He said an actor's work is only alive when they are doing it. Talking about it makes it weak. There are no rules, except to speak clearly. For every play, actors start new and learn again. When the play ends, they feel empty until the next one. This emptiness shows when they talk about their work. In a play of Hamlet, Adrian Lester plays Hamlet as a young man between boy and adult. His acting is simple and sure. He is very good with words and his body. He seems angry but also funny, so people like him. His body looks stiff, like it is waiting to move. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio and also seems moved from inside. This makes us ask: What is acting? Is it copying life? Who makes these bodies move? That is a big question in theatre. One director has a way to practice called 'dropping in'. Actors sit and listen to words. When they speak, they look at the words on a screen, think about what they mean, and wait for a reason to speak. For example, for the line 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?', they breathe and let a thought come, like a memory. They imagine a scene, like waiting in line, and then speak. The director says don't plan ahead; go with an empty mind and trust something will happen. The perfect theatre should make you feel important. Going to the theatre is a special event, and the workers should act like it. It's bad if they seem like it's just a job. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. Everyone should see and hear well and feel close to the stage. The room size is important; it should fit human voices and bodies. If it's too big, it's wrong because drama is about people. Many old theatres were good because the room held the stage well. I like theatres that feel old, like worn steps in a church, with many people's memories"}

We should pay attention to Paul Scofield's words in a letter: an actor's work only has life when performed; discussing it makes it seem empty and theoretical. There are no fixed rules, except perhaps being audible. With each play, actors start from nothing, learning anew and growing with the characters and writer's ideas. After the play ends, they feel empty until the next role, and this emptiness is clear in any talk about theatre. In a review of Hamlet, Adrian Lester's Hamlet is between boyhood and manhood, with a performance that is simple and confident. He handles the text well and shows great control, making him a top actor. He plays a tense, irritable young man with hidden anger, but he is also witty and humorous, making him strong and likable. His skill is clear, even if understated. Notice how his body hangs stiffly, as if waiting to be brought to life. Handy's Horatio gives a similar sense of being moved by an inner force. This raises questions: What is acting? Is it imitating behavior? Who animates these bodies? That's the central issue in theatre. One director uses a rehearsal method called 'dropping in'.

However, actors frequently resort to ponderous clichés, silly truisms, or get drawn into gossip. We ought to heed Paul Scofield's remarks in a letter: he found that an actor's work is vibrant only during its execution; in discussion, it becomes theoretical and insubstantial. There are no definitive rules, aside from perhaps audibility.

Yet, all too often, they lapse into ponderous clichés, trivial truisms, or the prurient mechanisms of gossip.

Lester plays an edgy, tetchy young man who feeds on a banked-down sense of anger, agile, watchful and driven, he deploys a sense of acid wit and generous humour that makes him both formidable and lovable. Although played down, the virtuosity of this performance is unmistakable. Observe Lester's body, the way his arms hang stiffly, giving you a sense of a figure waiting to be animated.","target_text":"Derision and contempt are sporadically directed at actors, with much of this disdain being fuelled by the actors themselves when they are compelled by their film or theatre companies to discourse upon their craft in interviews. They would be better served by emulating the dancer Pavlova's retort to an inquiry about the significance of her dance: 'If I could tell you,' she declared, 'I wouldn't dance it.' However, they frequently succumb to ponderous clichés, inane truisms, or the prurient machinations of the gossip industry. We ought to heed the insights of Paul Scofield, who articulated in a correspondence that an actor's work possesses vitality and intrigue exclusively in its execution; it appears to wither in discussion, becoming vacuously theoretical and insubstantial. It is governed by no rules, with the potential exception of audibility. With each theatrical production and playwright, the actor begins anew, as if entirely unacquainted with the craft, and proceeds to learn afresh, evolving through the intricate relationships of the characters and the profound insights of the writer. Upon the culmination of a play's run, the actor is left in a state of emptiness until the subsequent engagement, and it is this void that becomes manifest in any deliberation on theatrical endeavours. In an appraisal of Hamlet, Adrian Lester's portrayal is precariously balanced between boyhood and manhood, constituting a performance of thrilling simplicity and assurance. His adept manipulation of the text, coupled with his formidable physical and psychological self-control, elevates him from merely promising to a frontline performer—an actor endowed with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing. Lester embodies an edgy, tetchy young man who thrives on a banked-down sense of anger; he is agile, watchful, and driven, employing a sense of acid wit and generous humour that renders him both formidable and endearing. Although understated, the virtuosity inherent in this performance is unequivocal. Observe Lester's corporeal presence, the manner"}

The Fens, a region in England, featured prominently in the author's novel. Initially selected for their seemingly unobtrusive and flat nature as a setting, they proved to be neither flat nor empty upon deeper engagement. The Fens are quintessentially English yet hauntingly strange, remarkably perceived as foreign by many English people despite being centrally located.

The author's physical research was limited, preferring imaginative exploration, which aligns with the Fens' nature as not merely a landscape but a state of mind. Museums are obligated to render their collections accessible, moving beyond static displays with verbose labels to employ dynamic, theatrical techniques that captivate and evoke emotional responses. They should extend accessibility to diverse communities, exemplified by loan boxes for educators and resources for elderly individuals experiencing memory loss. Museums specialize in authentic artefacts and specimens, enabling direct encounters with historical reality, which distinguishes them from heritage centres and theme parks.

Heritage epitomizes a desire for continuity, wherein assurance regarding the past significantly bolsters confidence in the future, thereby enabling us to secure our historical legacy and a semblance of immortality.

The fragmentation of communities in Western industrial society has eroded oral traditions, compelling reliance on architectural mnemonic devices to decipher the past, and it is imperative to safeguard these linkages. The Fens, an English landscape, assumed a pivotal role in the author's novel, chosen for their ostensibly unobtrusive, planar character as a theatrical backdrop, though they revealed themselves to be neither flat nor vacant upon imaginative engagement. This region is remarkably English yet pervaded by a compelling and eerie strangeness, standing as an anomaly within England that many perceive as peculiarly foreign, despite the assimilation of other distinctive areas into the cultural and literary canon. The Fens embody contradictions: they are both barren and replete, both tamed and resiliently wild, superficially transparent yet deeply enigmatic. The author's empirical investigations were circumscribed, eschewing documentary verification in favor of imaginative conjecture, a approach justified by the Fens' unique quality as not solely a physical terrain but a psychological state.

Something he could wear so that wherever he goes he doesn't get the feeling that everybody is talking another language and doing whatever they do at half speed. I liked, no, not liked...

This depends on their skills, ideas, and what society thinks. In this book, we will see how this changes the photo and how people see it. For example, when you look at a photo in a newspaper, you might think it shows the truth. But we can ask: Is it real? Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is it important because of the moment, or does it mean something bigger? Sport: For me, sport is not just a game. The best players believe in themselves a lot. To be the best, you must focus only on sport and forget other things. Sport is hard, and no one helps you. You must try hard or fail. Sport teaches me to be disciplined and to work with a team. In my sport, you can be good alone, but it is a team game. You need to do both. It is like life: you can succeed alone, but remember others. Sport has given me many things, not just money.

Is the specific moment captured crucial, or does the photograph serve as a symbol for broader issues? Sport: For me, sport transcends being merely a game. The most accomplished athletes possess unwavering self-belief. Achieving success requires singular focus and the willingness to prioritize sport above all else. Sport is unforgiving, and individuals must take responsibility for their own progress. It has instilled in me discipline and determination, while also highlighting the advantages of teamwork. In my sport, there is room for individual excellence within a team framework, necessitating a balance between the two. This mirrors life, where personal success can coexist with awareness of others. Sport has enriched my life in numerous ways, including financial gains, and has broadened my horizons through global experiences, though these perks come with significant sacrifices.

This book will delve into how these factors not only dictate the style, content, and expression of the image but also shape its reception and interpretation by viewers. For instance, while a casual newspaper reader might implicitly accept photographic images as factual, we ought to interrogate whether they faithfully document the scene or instead communicate the photographer's subjective stance. Is the significance rooted in the precise instant captured, or should the photograph be regarded as a symbolic representation of wider circumstances? Sport: Sport has always represented more than just a game to me. The most successful individuals in sport exhibit absolute self-confidence. Attaining excellence demands tunnel vision and the capacity to disregard extraneous matters. Sport is inherently ruthless, necessitating self-reliance. It has taught me personal discipline and resolve, in addition to the benefits of collaborative effort. My sport permits and encourages individual achievement, yet it remains a team endeavor, requiring a equilibrium between these dual aspects.

Throughout this book, we shall explore how these determinants not only influence the style, content, and expressive quality of a photograph but also mediate its perception and the responses it elicits from viewers. For example, we might posit that the casual peruser of a newspaper possesses an implicit comprehension of the reproduced photographic images, yet rather than accepting them at face value, we might scrutinize whether they accurately chronicle the scene as it existed or, conversely, articulate the photographer's perspective. Is it the exact instant recorded that holds particular import, or ought the photograph be interpreted as a symbol encapsulating a state of affairs in the world? Sport: For me, sport has perpetually constituted more than merely a game. The most triumphant figures in sport demonstrate total self-belief. Achieving preeminence necessitates tunnel vision and the relegation of all ancillary concerns. Sport is inherently ruthless, and no external agency will effectuate one's success. It has inculcated in me personal discipline and determination, while also elucidating the advantages of functioning within a team. My sport facilitates and promotes individual excellence, yet it is fundamentally a team game, obliging a harmonization of these two dimensions. It bears a strong resemblance to life—one can flourish as an individual, yet must invariably acknowledge the presence of others.

We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. Author's Note These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell.

Books help us feel at home in the world. We see our own lives in books from long ago or far away. Writers use words to say what we feel but cannot say well. This makes us happy. Reading and travel help us see new things. When we go to a new place or read a great book, we notice more. We see the sky, faces, and feelings we did not see before. The author wrote these travel stories for a newspaper. He fixed small mistakes but did not change much. He could not know the future, like when money values changed. He was just a visitor trying to understand. Many people travel now because they can buy a ticket. Ecotourism is a word for holidays that help nature. But now it is used for many types of trips, like seeing tribes or wildlife. It started with good ideas, but there are no clear rules, so it is confusing. The author lost his notes from Transylvania for 50 years. He found them later. They helped him write about that time, but not perfectly. He stayed in many nice houses and did not write much. He thought he had nothing to write when he stopped. Later, he wrote the story without worrying about small details."}

Books can make us feel more comfortable in the world. We connect our experiences to stories in books from other times or places because people are similar. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors describe situations we thought were unique to us, often with clear and accurate words. What we felt shy or confused about is expressed boldly in books, which is surprising if the writer lived far away or long ago. We thank these writers for reminding us of ourselves. Through reading and travel, we avoid getting bored by routine. Our eyes are most open in new places or when reading a great book, which shows us interesting things we missed. Our mind notices details like the sky's color, changes in a face, or hidden sadness. The author published these travel thoughts in a newspaper over seven years. He fixed small edits and errors but added little. He could not predict future events, like changes in money value, as he was just a visitor learning about the place. Mass travel lets people explore the world with only a ticket price, and he believes not all travelers are blind to their experiences. Ecotourism is a term that has been overused. It started in the 1980s with environmental awareness and travelers wanting to avoid harm. Now, it includes many trips, such as living with tribes or seeing nature, but without clear rules, it confuses travelers. The author's notebook from Transylvania was lost for 50 years and found by luck. It helped him write about that time, but he did not rely on it fully. He stayed in hospitable houses for weeks and often stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. When he wrote his book, he avoided too many warnings and let the story flow."}

Books help us feel more at ease in the wider world. We relate our personal experiences to those in books from different eras or locations because human types are fewer than individuals. In the works of others, we discover our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can articulate situations we felt alone in, or express our ideas with a clarity and psychological precision we might lack. Our inner confusion is confidently and logically phrased in these books, a match that is striking if the author lived in a distant place or time. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of our identity. Reading and travel help us break free from the dulling effects of habit. We are most observant in new environments or when reading a significant book, which highlights interests we previously overlooked. Our mind acts like a radar, tuned to detect certain elements in our awareness, such as sky variations, facial expressions, or underlying emotions. The author's travel reflections were originally newspaper articles over seven years. He restored minor editorial cuts and corrected errors but made few additions. He could not foresee future developments, like currency fluctuations, as he was merely a visitor focused on understanding current events. Mass air travel has opened the world to people with no special qualifications beyond affording a ticket, yet he doubts all travelers were completely unaware. Ecotourism is a phrase that has been misappropriated and diluted. It emerged in the early 1980s, driven by environmental concerns and travelers' desires to minimize negative impacts. Now, it encompasses a wide range of activities, from cultural exchanges to nature tours, but the absence of regulations leaves many travelers confused in an ecotourism jungle. The author's Transylvanian notebook was lost for five decades and rediscovered by chance. It aided in reconstructing that period for publication, though it was not a perfect support. He enjoyed a easier time than planned, staying in welcoming country houses and often pausing his writing during halts, mistakenly believing he had nothing to document. When composing the book, he initially included many cautions but later allowed the narrative to proceed without restrictive caveats."}

The reality of mass jet travel is the world opening to individuals qualified only by ticket purchase, yet he never believed all fellow travelers were entirely blind. Ecotourism is a term that has been hijacked, diluted, and misused, earning top prize for such phrases. It originated in the early 1980s, reflecting heightened environmental awareness and tour operators' recognition of travelers' desires to avoid negative impacts. Nowadays, the ecotourism label broadly covers activities from immersive cultural tours to brief nature excursions, but the lack of regulations and a standard definition leaves travelers bewildered in an ecotourism jungle.

For instance, rushing mayonnaise causes it to curdle, and impatiently pulling a tangled fishing line only tightens the knot. The mind operates at different paces: some processes are rapid, like reflexive actions, while others are slow, such as contemplation. Essentially, the mind has three speeds: the fastest for immediate physical responses, a medium speed for logical reasoning, and the slowest for reflective thought. Slow thinking is particularly effective for intricate or ambiguous situations, fostering creativity and wisdom. Research in cognitive science supports that unconscious, patient thought can resolve complex issues that deliberate analysis cannot. Thus, both rapid and gradual mental processes are vital."}

Similarly, the mind functions across a spectrum of velocities: from instantaneous reactions to prolonged contemplation. Broadly, mental processing occurs at three tiers: ultra-rapid for unconscious reflexes, a deliberative pace for analytical reasoning, and a leisurely tempo for ruminative thought. This slower cognitive mode excels in navigating complex, ill-defined scenarios, enhancing creativity and insight. Cognitive science affirms that the unconscious mind, given time, can decipher subtle patterns and resolve intricate dilemmas more effectively than conscious intellect.

Expediting the emulsification of mayonnaise induces curdling, while impatient manipulation of an entangled fishing line only consolidates the knot. Analogously, the mind operates across a continuum of celerities: some functions are executed with alacrity, whereas others unfold over extended periods. The mind essentially encompasses three processing velocities: the pre-conscious for immediate somatic responses, the conscious for reasoned analysis, and the sub-conscious for contemplative assimilation. This gradual cognitive modality is particularly adept at elucidating nebulous and multifaceted circumstances, cultivating creativity and sagacity. Empirical investigations in cognitive science corroborate that the unconscious faculties, afforded sufficient time, can assimilate subtle patterns and surmount convoluted challenges more efficaciously than deliberate intellect.

This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous - and we are lost. Depressing? Perhaps, but don't give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity's temptations and perils - all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the 'WWW', as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life.

In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong wrote a blog about her job. Someone at her job saw it, and she lost her job. She was sad and stopped blogging. But later, she started again and wrote about her family. Now she is famous and makes money from her blog. She learned that you can say anything online, but you should be careful."}

You might think you are just saying 'I am at this place', but you are also telling many people, including some you do not want to meet. This shows that sharing too much on the web can have bad sides. The internet gives big chances to share parts of our lives with the world. We might get wealth or fame. So we join the busy internet, sharing personal things like stories and photos. Later, we see it is crowded and risky, and we feel lost. This is depressing, but do not give up. There is a map for this future, made by early internet users. They used the web long ago and found all the dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with fame, all before social media. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have been where we are going now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. In 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting his life on the web. At that time, the web was used by students and scientists. Hall built a big online story of his life with links, photos, and art. In 1996, he began a daily blog, and many readers watched him try new things. Hall wrote about everything and everyone. It was like art. But one day, he stopped his blog because of a love problem. He said sharing his life made people not trust him. The problem of sharing online continues. Sharing is good, but if you think it will make people like you, you might be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. A coworker sent her blog to her bosses, and she was fired. Experts call this the 'online distribution effect': we feel we can say things online that we would not say in person. But our online and real lives are connected. If we ignore this, we can make big mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. She was upset but later got married and started blogging about her family. Now she is a famous 'mommy blogger' and earns money from writing. She learned that the web lets us say anything, but we should think before we share."}

In 1996, he started a daily blog on a dare, and readers were drawn to his bold exploration of the new medium. Hall's approach was absolute: anyone he met could appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. This was exhibitionistic, but it had a rigor and beauty that could be considered art. However, one day, his site was replaced by a distressed video called Dark Night. His story emerged: he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was given an ultimatum to stop the blog or lose the relationship. He had shared his life online and found that it made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the dilemma remains. Sharing online is beneficial, but if you expect it to make people want to be with"}

The site's message was straightforward: while you may believe you are merely informing others of your whereabouts, you are simultaneously advertising your presence to a broad audience, including individuals you might not wish to encounter. This reinforced the increasing recognition that the frenetic sharing facilitated by the web possesses potential drawbacks. The extensive new opportunities to publish virtually every facet of our lives to a potentially global audience present alluring prospects such as wealth and fame. Consequently, we immerse ourselves in the tumultuous internet, disseminating confessions, personal photographs, and narratives into the digital abyss. Belatedly, we comprehend that these waters are congested and perilous, leaving us disoriented. Depressing? Possibly, but optimism is warranted. This future is charted by a map drafted years ago by a daring cohort of online pioneers. During the web's infancy, they navigated these domains and pinpointed all the hazardous zones. They endured job terminations, formed and severed friendships, and confronted the allure and dangers of celebrity, all preceding the advent of social networking. These trailblazers, the initial wave of what we now term bloggers, have already traversed the path that many of us are embarking upon. Before their accounts fade from collective memory, it is prudent to dedicate time to their experiences.

I do not know what happened to him between our meetings. I could invent things to fill the gaps and make the story smoother, but I choose not to. I only want to write what I truly know.

It is very difficult to understand people from other countries. People are shaped by where they were born, how they grew up, what they ate, and what they read.

I could use imagination to fill in the gaps and create a more coherent narrative, but I have no desire to do so. My intention is simply to record what I know.

I have occasionally taken the liberty, as historians do, to invent speeches for characters that I did not witness, in order to add vitality and realism to scenes that would otherwise be dull. I want the book to be engaging, and I feel justified in this approach. Astute readers will easily identify these invented parts and are free to disregard them. Another source of my apprehension is that the main subjects of this book belong to a different culture.

However, it is also conceivable that the manner of living he has elected and the exceptional fortitude and gentleness of his disposition could exert an increasingly significant impact on his contemporaries, such that, long after his death, it might be acknowledged that an extraordinary individual inhabited this era.

{"input_text":"simplify to A1: Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. Indeed the whole cast is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with the other young officers get dangerously out of hand, and the moment when Iago begins to lose control and has to struggle to get a grip on himself. And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production. Lake Vostok In the heart of Antarctica, nothing stirs. On the fringes of the continent there are penguins, seals and birds aplenty. But up on the great white plateau in the interior, life has no foothold. Except, that is, in a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometres of ice, directly below the coldest spot on earth. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists can hardly wait to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within. Geologists and glaciologists are hot on their heels. For two years now, researchers round the world have been plotting ways to uncover the lakes secrets, and, if they get their wish, in the next few years we will witness the decade of Lake Vostok.
