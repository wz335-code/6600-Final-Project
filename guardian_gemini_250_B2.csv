Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim worked for Brazil's government for a long time. He had a very important job in foreign affairs. But he said that 2019 was a very unusual year for Latin America. He had never seen anything like it.

That year, many countries in Latin America had problems. These problems included political changes and social unrest. It started in Venezuela. People protested against the leader, Nicolás Maduro. Many people thought he would lose his power.

Juan Guaidó tried to remove Maduro from his position. But he was not successful. The situation became calmer after some time.

However, other countries started having problems too. There were protests and violence in Puerto Rico and Haiti. In Ecuador, people protested a lot. In Bolivia, the president, Evo Morales, had to leave his job. This happened because the military used force. Some people thought this was like a new beginning for Latin America, similar to the ""Arab Spring.""

In Peru, the president closed the congress. In Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner became important in politics again. In Colombia, many people protested against the president, Iván Duque.

Even Chile had problems. People thought Chile was a stable and rich country. But there were big protests there because the price of subway tickets went up. This caused a lot of damage. The president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, had problems because of this.

Ivan Briscoe, who works for the International Crisis Group, was surprised by what happened in Chile. He thought the situation in Latin America was changing very fast. He said that the new year would be uncertain."
0,0_1,1,"“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","Things have been growing for many years. This includes problems like different social classes in Chile. It also includes Evo Morales wanting to stay in power forever in Bolivia. And there is a big fight in Venezuela. Now, these problems are becoming obvious in many places. We do not know what will happen next.

Someone said they know where the problems will be next year. But they do not know exactly what will happen.

Some people on the left in Latin America are happy about the confusion. Amorim, who is 77, thinks the problems are a reaction from the people. They are reacting to bad things happening to their countries, like Colombia and Chile. These bad things are called ""neoliberalism.""

Amorim said it is hard to know what will happen next. He said that eight months ago, it seemed like everything was going to the right side of politics. But now, it is not so clear. He thinks this is progress, even though there are still problems.

He said Latin America is having a hard time. But for people on the left, this is better than nothing happening.

The year is ending, and people are thinking about what will happen next. A report said there is a big chance that protests will spread. The protests in Colombia were inspired by protests in other countries.

The report said that 2020 will probably be another difficult year for Latin America. They think Ecuador will have a very hard time.

Amorim agreed that it is like a bomb waiting to explode. He said Ecuador could explode again at any time.

Someone else, Briscoe, thinks there will be three problem areas in 2020. One is Venezuela, because it is getting worse with politics and people's needs. Another is Brazil and Argentina, because their leaders disagree a lot. The last is Mexico, where the president is trying to stop many murders. Almost 100 people are killed every day there."
0,0_2,2,"Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.","In 2014, many people in Mexico protested. This happened because 43 students went missing. People were very upset. Someone named Briscoe said this could happen again if the killings did not stop.

Briscoe also talked about Bolivia. He thought there could be problems there. This would happen if Luis Fernando Camacho got to the second part of the election. Camacho is very conservative. He would be against someone from Evo Morales’ party. Morales' party is leftist.

Briscoe said things could be difficult in many countries. He mentioned Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. He said things could go very wrong in these places.

Briscoe said there is a lot of anger in society. He thinks Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Chile could also have problems.

People have different ideas about Brazil. Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America. Some people think there could be unrest there. Lula da Silva used to be the president. He told his supporters to do what Chile did and rebel against the current president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is far-right.

Some people think Bolsonaro's election in 2018 stopped people from protesting. They think it took the anger off the streets for now.

Monica de Bolle is an expert on Latin America. She thinks Brazil could be next to have problems. She said people are not protesting right now. But things can change.

She thinks people will soon realize that the economy is not growing. This is because the government's plans are not good. Then, Bolsonaro will lose support.

This could lead to problems like Brazil had in the past. It could even be like 2013. In 2013, there were big protests. These protests led to Dilma Rousseff being removed from her job three years later.

Amorim also thinks Brazil could have problems. He thinks people are angry at Bolsonaro because he is not doing a good job."
0,0_3,3,"“There hasn’t yet been a popular reaction [against Bolsonaro] – but I think it will come. If there’s a small spark it could very easily propagate,” he said. But perhaps not quite yet. “Everything here in Brazil is slow,” Amorim admitted. “Except samba.”","Here is the rewritten text in CEFR B2 level English:

People are not really against Bolsonaro yet. But I think this will happen. If something small starts it, it could grow fast. But maybe not right now. Amorim said that things in Brazil take time. Only samba is fast."
1,1_0,0,"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago.","People were protesting in Iraq. They attacked the American embassy in Baghdad. This was bad for the United States.

The protesters shouted, ""Death to America."" They also supported groups that are loyal to Iran. Some diplomats were stuck inside the embassy.

Hundreds of protesters went to the US building. They broke through the main gate. They damaged some rooms inside. This was a bad day for the US.

The protesters started fires. They broke doors. They threw things at the windows. It seemed like the Iraqi police helped the protesters. The police let them into the Green Zone, which is usually very safe.

The protesters climbed the walls of the embassy. They threw stones. US guards used tear gas. They did not shoot.

Donald Trump said that Iran planned the attack. This happened after the US attacked some places in Iraq and Syria on Sunday.

These places belonged to a group called Kata’ib Hezbollah. This group is supported by Iran. It is part of the Iraqi army.

At least 25 fighters died in the US attacks. Many more were hurt. The US said they did the attacks to stop future attacks.

Before this, a US base in Kirkuk was attacked with rockets on Friday. One American working there died. Four other Americans were hurt. President Trump agreed to the US attacks on Saturday.

The US attacks did not help the US. They seem like another mistake in the Middle East. The Iraqi government was very angry about the attacks.

Groups that support Iran said they will attack American places again. They want the US soldiers to leave Iraq.

Trump said that Iran killed an American. He said the US will always respond strongly. He also said Iran is attacking the US embassy in Iraq. He said Iran will be responsible for this.

The US embassy said that the ambassador and his staff were not leaving quickly. Some news reports in Iraq said they were.

An embassy worker said the ambassador, Matthew Tueller, was on vacation. He left Baghdad one week ago."
1,1_1,1,"The embassy was under lockdown but had not been evacuated, the spokesperson said, with diplomats sheltering in a safe-room. Video from the scene showed thick grey smoke engulfing the compound against a backdrop of wailing from an emergency siren. Protesters shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. By nightfall fires were still burning. One masked man walked off insouciantly with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part.","The embassy was closed. It was not empty. People inside were safe, said a person who speaks for the embassy. They were hiding in a safe room.

A video showed a lot of smoke. The smoke was grey and thick. It covered the embassy area. An emergency alarm was making a loud noise.

People were protesting. They shouted against America. They shouted against Trump. They said they wanted America to die.

Fires were still burning when night came. A man wore a mask. He took a sign from the US embassy. He did not seem to care.

Some people who used to work at the embassy said it was like what happened in Tehran in 1979. In 1979, people attacked the US embassy in Tehran. They took 52 Americans as prisoners.

What happened today was not as bad. Nobody died. The embassy building was not destroyed.

But there is a danger of more fighting. The US and Iran are fighting in Iraq. The US has put strong rules and pressure on Iran. This has not helped. The US and Iraq do not have good relations now.

The leader of Iraq is Adel Abdul-Mahdi. He is friends with both Iran and the US. He said he will keep US people safe.

At first, Iraqi soldiers did not stop the violence. Later, they came in large numbers. They stood between the protesters and the US guards.

The US Secretary of State is Mike Pompeo. He said the US will protect its people. He said this in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi.

The US embassy in Baghdad is very big. Now, people are wondering if it can stay open. Protesters are camping outside the embassy.

Many protesters came from funerals. The funerals were for militia fighters who died. They carried flags. The flags belonged to Kata’ib Hezbollah and Hashd al-Shaabi. Hashd al-Shaabi is a strong group of soldiers. Kata’ib Hezbollah is part of this group."
1,1_2,2,"Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the Iranian-backed Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq militia, and many other senior militia leaders were among the demonstrators. On Monday, Iran condemned the US strikes as “terrorism”. Russia complained it had not been given advance warning. Street protests take place regularly in the Iraqi capital. In recent months, security guards have shot dead more than 450 people protesting against rampant government corruption and the growing influence of Iranian-backed groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah.","Qais al-Khazali was there. He is the leader of a group called Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq. This group gets support from Iran. Many other important leaders of militias were also with the protesters.

On Monday, Iran said the US attacks were ""terrorism."" Russia was not happy. They said they did not know about the attacks before they happened.

People often protest in the streets of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. Recently, many people have died during these protests. Security guards have shot more than 450 people. These people were protesting against corruption in the government. They were also protesting against groups that Iran supports. One of these groups is called Kata’ib Hezbollah. These groups have too much power in Iraq."
2,2_0,0,"A magnitude-5.1 earthquake has struck near Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant on Friday, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

There was an earthquake in Iran on Friday. The earthquake was near the Bushehr nuclear plant. The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was magnitude 5.1.

A magnitude 5.1 earthquake is not very strong. But it can still cause some damage. The center of the earthquake was 53 km from Bushehr. Bushehr is a city on the coast. The nuclear plant is in Bushehr. The earthquake happened at 5:23 in the morning, local time. The earthquake was 38 km deep in the ground.

After the earthquake, there were no reports of damage. Iranian TV said that they did not hear about any damage.

The Bushehr nuclear plant was built to be strong. It can handle bigger earthquakes. Jahangir Dehqan works for the emergency department. He said that there was no damage to the plant. He talked to people from the Red Crescent and local villages. They said everything was okay.

Iran has many earthquakes. This is because Iran is on top of big cracks in the ground.

In 2003, there was a big earthquake in the city of Bam. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.6. The city was destroyed. 26,000 people died. Bam is close to the Bushehr nuclear plant. But the plant was not damaged in 2003.

In 2019, Iran said they would make more uranium. This was more than they were allowed to make in 2015. This happened after the US left the 2015 nuclear deal. Donald Trump was the president of the US then. Iran says that their nuclear program is only for peaceful things. They say it is not for making bombs."
3,3_0,0,"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said.","The Hungarian mangalica pig is a special animal. An emperor created it. Later, some people tried to kill them all. This pig has lived for almost 200 years.

It is a big, heavy pig. It has a coat like a sheep. It is the pig with the most hair and fat. Many people think it tastes very good.

Thirty years ago, there were very few mangalica pigs left. But they have become popular again in Hungary. People like them on farms, on their tables, and in their hearts.

Now, the mangalica pig is famous around the world. You can find it in good restaurants in the US and Japan. In Japan, they call it ""Kobe pork"" because it is very fatty.

In Hungary, the mangalica pig is very important. It is a national treasure.

But now, the mangalica pig is in danger again. A disease is spreading in Eastern Europe. It is called African swine fever. This disease is killing many pigs.

The mangalica pig is becoming more popular. This is causing problems with Hungary's neighbors.

Recently, an American blogger made a video about the mangalica pig. Many people watched it. In the video, the blogger said the mangalica pig was from Romania. This made people in Hungary angry.

Hungary used to rule part of Romania. There are still problems between the two countries. Hungarian newspapers were very upset. They said that Romania was trying to steal their culture and history. They said Romania also wanted to steal the mangalica pig.

Péter Tóth is in charge of the Mangalica Breeders Association in Hungary. He said the situation could become like the food hummus. Hummus is important to both Lebanon and Israel.

He said that all the mangalica pigs in Romania came from Hungary. But he also said that the history of the pig is international."
3,3_1,1,"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic.","Here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level:

In the 1830s, someone made a new kind of pig. The emperor in Vienna got some pigs from Serbia. These pigs were fat and had long hair.

The emperor made them breed with Hungarian pigs. This happened near a town. The town is now in Romania.

A long time ago, most pigs in Hungary were this kind. They were called Mangalica pigs. Ninety percent of pigs were Mangalica.

These pigs had a lot of fat. People liked the fat because they could keep it longer than meat. They used the fat for cooking.

Later, people started using electricity. They could keep food cold. So, they did not need as much fat. Mangalica pigs became special and expensive.

After the war, things changed. The government almost destroyed the Mangalica pigs. Only a few pigs were left. About 300 were kept for science. You could not buy the meat anywhere.

A young student was studying animals in Spain. His name was Tóth. He told his friend about the fat Hungarian pigs. They wanted to save the pigs.

Tóth put ads in newspapers. He asked people to tell him if they saw a Mangalica pig. He bought all the Mangalica pigs he could find.

He bred the pigs with money from Spain. After some years, they had enough pigs. They sent the fat pork to Spain. They made special food with it. This was in the late 1990s.

Now, there are many Mangalica farmers in Hungary. More than 200 farmers raise these pigs. You can buy the meat in markets. It costs more than normal pork. It costs about four times as much.

Zsóka Fekete has a Mangalica farm. Her farm is in eastern Hungary. She says the meat is special. It tastes different from other meat.

She says the meat has lines of fat. This is especially true in the neck. She says it has a very special taste.

Zsóka used to work in a big company. She worked in Budapest. But in 2012, she went back to her family farm. She bought 20 Mangalica pigs. Now, she has 300 pigs.

She sells her meat to many people. Some are important restaurants. Some are people in Budapest who love Mangalica meat. They wait in line to buy her meat. She goes to Budapest to sell her meat every two weeks.

The only problem for Mangalica pigs now is a disease. The disease is called African swine fever. It can hurt the pigs."
3,3_2,2,"The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”","In Hungary, some wild pigs got sick in April. It was a bad virus.

No farm pigs have the virus yet. But the virus spreads very easily. If a dead, sick pig is found, all pigs near it must be killed. This area is about two miles wide.

The mangalica pig is in danger. These pigs live partly outside. New rules will help protect them. Farmers will use two fences. People cannot visit the farms now.

About 1,200 mangalica pigs have died in Hungary. This is more than ten percent of all mangalica pigs.

A man named Tóth said the government has a plan to help the mangalica. They will save the pig's genes. They will also move some important pigs to safe places. Zoos and schools might keep them safe.

Some people worry about eating too much meat. But many people in Hungary eat pork. It may take time for them to eat less meat. Some people think not eating meat is strange.

But Tóth wants people to eat less meat. He does not like the way some meat is made. He thinks it is bad for the animals. He wants people to eat better meat.

He said people should eat less meat. But when they eat meat, it should be good meat. He said maybe one piece of mangalica per week is good."
4,4_0,0,"The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.","Here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level English:

People in India are protesting. They are unhappy about changes to the citizenship law. This is good because it shows India's democracy is working. The people are speaking up, even though the government is not listening to the constitution.

The constitution was made carefully. People talked about it for three years. These people had fought against British rule. They took power from the British in a good and fair way. This showed how British rule was not right.

Someone named Henry Maine said that British rule in India was strange. He said it was like a free country ruling another country like a dictator.

India became free in 1947. It was a difficult time with fighting. But India promised to be a fair country. It promised freedom and equality for everyone. It kept this promise for 70 years.

Now, India has problems with the constitution. This is because of a new law. This law was made quickly and is based on religion. It goes against what the founders of India wanted for the country. They wanted a country that was fair and diverse.

Vinita Damodaran is a professor. She teaches about South Asian history. She wrote about another article.

The article was about police in Canada. The police were ready to shoot Indigenous people. This is very bad.

She also said that England is responsible for colonialism in Canada. In 1670, England took land called Rupert's Land. They did this easily, without asking. Then, the Hudson Bay Company took resources from this land.

England started everything about how Canada is now. England gained a lot from colonialism in Canada.

She is not saying that Canada today is not responsible. But the article should also mention England's role. It should show that England is also responsible."

5,5_0,0,"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family’s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian café, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again.","**Food and Restaurants**

Brexit has been hard for restaurants. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union. It has caused problems.

The British pound is worth less now. This means things restaurants buy, like food, cost more.

Also, people from other European countries who work in restaurants are worried. They are not sure if they can stay in the UK. This makes it hard for restaurants to keep their workers. Many workers help customers.

The UK left the European Union in January. But things may not get better for restaurants in 2020.

Restaurant owners say it is difficult to keep workers from other countries. These workers wonder if they have a future in the UK.

The food processing business has the same problem. Many of their workers are from Eastern Europe.

When it's hard to keep workers, businesses pay them more. This means food will cost more for customers. So, prices at restaurants and food stores will probably go up.

**Less Meat**

Scientists are worried about the Earth's climate. They want countries to say when they will stop making more meat.

Many people are already eating less meat. The store Greggs started selling a vegan sausage roll. Vegan means no meat or animal products.

In the future, more people will eat vegetarian and vegan food. Vegetarian means no meat. Restaurants will have more vegetarian and vegan options.

**New Food**

Food from Africa might become popular, especially in London.

A restaurant called Chuku's will open in February. It will serve Nigerian food. It used to be a temporary restaurant. Now it will have a permanent place.

Also, William JM Chilila will open a restaurant called Akoko. It will have food from West Africa.

**People to Watch**

Nisha Katona used to be a lawyer. Now she has a restaurant called Mowgli. It serves Indian food like her family made.

She started with one restaurant. Now she has ten. She will open four more in 2020. She also has plans for four more after that."

He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.","**Daniel Humm**

Daniel Humm is an American chef. He is now working in Britain. Many American chefs before him have tried to become famous in Britain. Humm has three Michelin stars for his restaurant in New York. It is called Eleven Madison Park. He just opened a new restaurant at Claridge’s Hotel in London. The restaurant is in the place where other chefs had restaurants before. One was Simon Rogan, who had a restaurant called Fera. Before that, Gordon Ramsay had a restaurant there. These restaurants were not very successful. Humm hopes his new restaurant will be successful. It is called Davies and Brook. It is named after the two streets where Claridge’s Hotel is located.

**Will Beckett and Huw Gott**

Restaurants can also move from Britain to America. Will Beckett and Huw Gott are opening a restaurant in New York. They are the team behind Hawksmoor. Hawksmoor is a famous group of restaurants. They are known for their good food. New York is known as a great city for steak. It will be interesting to see what New Yorkers think of British steak.

**Climate**

Next year, politicians have a chance to stop the climate crisis. The climate crisis is a big problem for the world. In November, people will meet in Glasgow. This is a UN meeting about climate change. It is called COP26. They will try to agree on ways to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon emissions cause the earth to get warmer. They want to keep the earth from getting too much warmer. Scientists say the earth has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius. This is since before factories were common. If we do not act, the earth could warm by 3 or 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. This could cause many problems. There could be big storms and rising sea levels. Deserts could spread, and crops could fail. There could be deadly heatwaves. These things could hurt people all over the world.

In 2020, people will try to prepare for the meeting in Glasgow. They want countries to agree to reduce carbon emissions. They also want to help poor countries in the fight against climate change. Poor countries say that rich countries made most of the carbon emissions in the past. They say that rich countries are not doing enough now. They want rich countries to give them money. They want at least $100 billion each year. This money would help them stop the bad effects of climate change. It would also help them to reduce emissions. So far, it has been hard to get both sides to agree."
5,5_2,2,"Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously – threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future. Temperatures also reached record highs in Australia, triggering continent-wide bushfires, while in Africa, the Victoria Falls – one of the planet’s greatest cascades of water – dried to a trickle in 2019. The Glasgow talks will take place against this grim, ecological background. Robin McKie Three to watch Greta Thunberg Can the activist maintain the momentum of the climate protest movement? Donald Trump He is pulling the US out of international climate agreements by 4 November, 2020. But if he loses next year’s presidential election, on 3 November, and a Democrat wins, the US would rejoin talks in 2021. Claire Perry O’Neill As president of COP26, it will be the principal job of the former Tory MP to ensure the talks are successful. Politics The UK’s membership of the European Union will be terminated at the end of January, but that’s not Brexit done. We then enter a transition period while there are tough and complex negotiations about the future relationship with our closest neighbours and most important trading partners. Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters. There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020. The SNP will demand it, but without any real conviction that it can get one from a Conservative government that has set an adamantine face against the idea. This refusal will suit the Nationalists.","Greenland's ice is melting very fast. It is melting seven times faster than in the 1990s. The ice in West Antarctica is also becoming unstable. This is dangerous. It could cause the sea level to rise. This would be very bad for countries like Bangladesh and islands in the Pacific Ocean.

Australia had very hot temperatures. These temperatures were the highest ever recorded. This caused big bushfires across the country. In Africa, the Victoria Falls almost dried up in 2019. This waterfall is usually very large.

The Glasgow talks will happen with these problems in mind.

Here are some people to watch at the talks:

Greta Thunberg: She is a climate activist. Can she keep the climate protest movement going?

Donald Trump: He is taking the United States out of climate agreements. This will happen in November 2020. If he loses the election in November 2020, a new president could bring the US back into the talks in 2021.

Claire Perry O’Neill: She is in charge of the COP26 talks. Her job is to make sure the talks are successful.

The United Kingdom will leave the European Union in January. But this is not the end of Brexit. There will be more talks about the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The EU is the UK's closest neighbor and most important trading partner.

Boris Johnson is the leader of the UK. He wants a trade deal with the EU. He wants no taxes and no limits on trade. He does not want to follow the same rules as the EU. The EU might not agree to this.

Boris Johnson said the UK will leave the EU without a deal if there is no agreement by the end of the year. This could be bad for the British economy. It could especially hurt factories and the people who voted for him.

By the end of the year, we will know if Boris Johnson was serious.

There will not be another vote about Scotland leaving the UK in 2020. The SNP, a political party in Scotland, wants a vote. But the Conservative government does not want to allow it. This is good for the SNP because they can still protest."
5,5_3,3,"Current polling suggests that they can’t be confident of winning a referendum now, and a second defeat would surely kill their ambition for a long time. The SNP’s true aim is to stoke Scottish resentment against Westminster to pave the way for a big win in the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That’s the year with the potential for a constitutional car crash that rips apart the kingdom. Both the Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the latter contest, which is expected to climax around March. Expect bitter rows about the election process as the Corbynites who control the party’s national executive committee try to fix the terms of the battle to favour their continuity candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey.

People think that they might not win a vote now. If they lose a second vote, they will probably stop trying for a long time.

The SNP wants people in Scotland to be angry with the government in London. They want to win the Scottish parliament elections in 2021. That year could be a bad one for the UK, and it could cause big problems.

The Liberal Democrats and Labour will get new leaders. People will pay more attention to the Labour election. It will probably end around March.

There will be arguments about how the election works. Some people in Labour want their person, Rebecca Long Bailey, to win. They will try to make the rules fair for her.

Other people in Labour think that if someone like Jeremy Corbyn becomes leader again, Labour will not win for ten more years. If that happens, these people might leave the party and start something new.

**Three People to Watch:**

**Boris Johnson:** He promised many things about Brexit, healthcare, and money for the north of England. Will he keep his promises? Or will his time as leader start to go wrong in 2020?

**Nicola Sturgeon:** She won a big victory in Scotland in December 2019. Everyone will watch her to see what she does. She wants Scotland to become independent. Will she be able to use her popularity to achieve this?

**Rebecca Long Bailey:** It will be hard for her to win the Labour leadership. Many people want the job. Will Labour members choose her because she is like Corbyn? Or will they want someone new?

**Arts:**

If you want to watch Dracula by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, you should also watch Babylon Berlin. It is a show from Germany and costs a lot of money to make. It is about Germany in the past, and it has subtitles. It is exciting and scary. You can watch it on Sky 1 on January 24."

6,6_0,0,"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","Mark Carney is leaving his job as the head of the Bank of England. He said that companies must explain why they still invest in fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are things like oil and gas. He said that these investments could become useless.

He spoke on a BBC radio show. He said that banks are starting to invest less in oil and gas. But he thinks this change is too slow.

After leaving his job, Carney will work with the United Nations. He will help with climate change and money. He spoke on the radio show because Greta Thunberg helped to make the show. Greta Thunberg is someone who works to stop climate change.

Carney has been talking about climate change for a long time. He thinks banks need to do more to stop using fossil fuels. He said that climate change is a big problem coming soon. He said we will have more bad weather.

He said that if we wait for the weather to get really bad, it will be too late. Leaders need to start working on these problems now.

Someone asked Carney if people should stop investing in fossil fuel companies. Carney said that people who manage money must decide. They must explain why they are investing in these companies.

Someone asked if retirement funds should stop investing in oil and gas. This is even if these investments make money. Carney said that these funds need to explain why they are investing. He said some of these investments might become worthless.

He said that we cannot burn all the oil and gas. If we do, we will not reach our goals for stopping climate change. He said that a lot of coal and oil will become useless.

He asked companies, banks, and other groups what their plan is. He wants to know how they will deal with climate change.

The Bank of England said that a lot of money could become worthless. This could happen if banks and companies do not stop using fossil fuels. This amount could be as much as $20 trillion."

Complaining about how much internal opposition there had been to this item being included, Moore accused the BBC of “climate change alarmism”.","Here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level:

Mark Carney spoke in an interview. He told people who don't believe in climate change to stop disagreeing. He said we need to have all the right information. We cannot change the truth or hide things.

Charles Moore does not believe in climate change. He used to be the editor of the Daily Telegraph newspaper. He was in charge of a radio show called ""Today"" on Saturday.

In his radio show, he asked questions about climate change. He said that most people agree about the climate crisis. But he questioned this idea.

Moore said it was hard to get this topic on the radio show. Many people at the BBC did not want it. Moore said the BBC was too worried about climate change. He called it ""climate change alarmism."""
7,7_0,0,"A man who was shot dead in central Moscow after opening fire on the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s main intelligence agency building, in an attack that killed two has been identified as a gun enthusiast. Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.","A man was killed in Moscow. He shot at the office of the FSB. The FSB is Russia's main intelligence agency. The attack killed two people.

The man who shot was named Yevgeny Manyurov. He was 39 years old. He was from a town near Moscow. He liked guns very much.

On Thursday evening, Manyurov used a gun. He shot at the windows of the FSB building. The FSB building is in Lubyanka. One FSB worker died.

On Friday evening, another FSB officer died. He died in the hospital because he was hurt. One more FSB officer was badly hurt. Three other people were hurt too. One of them was not an officer.

Officials said that an FSB sniper shot and killed Manyurov. Officers found bombs in his bag. They also found something that could explode.

Security people said Manyurov did not get inside the FSB building. The building used to be the main office of the KGB. The KGB was the secret police in the Soviet Union.

Russian news said the man lived alone with his mother. They said he really liked guns. He did not have a job. He used to work as a security guard. He worked at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow. His father told this to the news.

Manyurov recently won a prize in a shooting contest. The contest was by a sports group. This group started again in 2009. Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, started it again.

Police took guns from his home. He owned them legally. He had two rifles and two shotguns. Reports say he used a Kalashnikov rifle in the attack.

Oleg Solovich taught Manyurov at a shooting club. He said Manyurov was not a good shooter. He wore a long black coat when he came to shoot. Solovich told him to take off the coat. But Manyurov said he liked wearing it."
7,7_1,1,"The motive for the attack remains unclear, although Kommersant, a daily newspaper, reported that witnesses told investigators he was shouting slogans “typical of Islamic State”. “I noticed he had been somewhat agitated lately,” Baza, a media outlet with links to the security services, cited his mother as saying. She said he was unmarried, with no children or close friends, and that he was passionate about guns. He appears to have had no social media presence. The assault on the FSB office took place shortly after Putin’s annual press conference in Moscow. The president was attending a gala concert at the nearby Kremlin in honour of the security services during the shootout. The attack may have been planned to coincide with the speech, an FSB source told Reuters. Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process.","The reason for the attack is not known. A newspaper called Kommersant said people heard the attacker shouting. They said he was shouting things like the Islamic State group says.

A news site called Baza talked to the attacker's mother. She said he seemed worried recently. She said he was not married and had no kids. He didn't have close friends. She also said he really liked guns. He didn't seem to use social media.

The attack was on an office of the FSB. The FSB is a security service. The attack happened after Putin gave a speech in Moscow. Putin was at a concert in the Kremlin. The Kremlin is near the FSB office. The concert was for the security services.

Someone from the FSB told Reuters news agency that the attack might have been planned. It might have been planned to happen when Putin was giving his speech.

A news website called Meduza said the police kept shooting after the attacker was dead. They might have hurt someone who was walking by. The attacker's name was Manyurov."
8,8_0,0,"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries. A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration.","The Green party in Austria may soon be part of the government. This would be the first time for them. They made a deal with the conservative party. Sebastian Kurz leads this party. He will likely be the leader of Austria again.

The Green party will be a smaller partner in the government. The conservative party is called ÖVP. The Green party will replace another party. This other party is called the Freedom party. Their leaders left because of a scandal. People did not vote for them in the last election.

Kurz's party and the Green party did well in the election. Kurz's party got the most votes, 37%. The Green party got their best result ever.

The two parties talked for many months. They made a deal on Saturday. Kurz said he thinks they can form a government. The Green party leader is Werner Kogler. He will probably be the second in charge.

The Green party needs to agree to the deal. If they do, the new government could start on January 7.

Other countries are watching this closely. In Switzerland, the Green party did well in the elections. They want more power in the government.

In Germany, the Green party is also popular. They could do well in the next election.

A German newspaper wrote about Austria. They said that something is happening there that people in Germany can only dream about. It is a fresh start with two parties that did well in the elections.

Kurz's party won the election by a lot. They will have the most power in the government. They will probably control important jobs like leader and finance minister. They will also likely control the police, foreign affairs, and the army. They will also create a new job to continue Kurz's strict rules about people coming to Austria."
8,8_1,1,"It will be run by his confidante Susanne Raab, who worked on the country’s 2017 ban on full-face veils and a 2015 law designed to curb “political Islam”. The Green party will aim to exercise the most influence through a boosted ministry for infrastructure, transport and environment, expected to be headed by the former climate activist Leonore Gewessler. Green politicians in charge of the justice and culture portfolios will hope to curb the more authoritarian tendencies of Kurz’s ÖVP. In the final stretch of negotiations, Austria’s constitutional court ruled that some of the policies proposed by the conservatives – such as expanded surveillance measures or making social benefits conditional on command of the German language – would violate the constitution. “The Greens’ main aim [during coalition talks] has been to get major concessions on protecting the climate,” said Der Standard newspaper, commenting that the deal with the conservatives was as likely to please environmentalists as to frustrate leftwingers in the party. “With everything else, damage limitation will have to do.”","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level, following your instructions:

Susanne Raab will manage it. She is a trusted person to him. She worked on a law in 2017. This law stopped people from covering their faces. She also worked on a law in 2015. That law tried to stop ""political Islam.""

The Green party wants to have a lot of power. They want to do this through a bigger ministry. This ministry is for roads, transportation, and the environment. Leonore Gewessler is expected to lead it. She used to fight for the climate.

Green politicians will control justice and culture. They hope to stop Kurz's party from becoming too strict. Kurz's party is called ÖVP.

Before the deal was done, something important happened. The court said some ideas from the conservatives were against the rules. These ideas were about watching people more. They also wanted people to speak German to get help from the government. The court said this was not okay.

A newspaper called Der Standard said something about the Greens. They said the Greens wanted to protect the climate during the talks. The newspaper thought some people would be happy. But some people in the Green party might be sad. The newspaper said that limiting damage to the climate is the best that can be done."
9,9_0,0,"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes. CGT union workers also voted to halt production at Total’s Grandpuits refinery.","French train workers are on strike. They do not like changes to their pensions.

The workers had a protest in Paris. They met with police. The police were there to control the crowd.

The protest was on Monday morning. It was outside a big train station. The station is called Gare de Lyon. Many people use this station to travel south for Christmas. Some go to ski in the Alps. Many trains were cancelled.

Some workers gave speeches. They talked about the pension changes. They said they would keep striking. They will strike through Christmas and New Year.

The protesters used flares and fireworks. There was smoke in the train station. The police wore helmets and shields. They stood near the ticket gates.

The train strike has lasted 19 days. It is causing problems for train travel. The train company called it a ""severe disruption.""

The French president asked the workers to stop striking for Christmas. But most workers did not agree. People waited in lines to buy tickets. Only a few trains were running.

Some train trips were shorter than normal. Some trains were replaced by buses. Many people had their train tickets cancelled. This was on December 23 and 24. People had to find other ways to travel. Some used car-sharing. Some rented cars at the last minute.

It was also difficult to travel on the Paris subway. There were also problems with local trains. Many people gathered at another train station. It is called Gare du Nord. They were waiting for trains to the suburbs.

Some people needed to go to the airport. They said it was hard to find taxis. Some taxi drivers charged too much money. They charged more because the traffic was very bad.

People are worried about getting home after Christmas. The strikes will continue in January.

Also, an oil refinery in the south of France stopped working. Workers voted to stop making oil. This is also a protest about the pension changes. Workers at another oil refinery also stopped working."
9,9_1,1,"Emmanuel Lepine, the secretary general of the CGT’s oil branch, told France Info radio that CGT workers at other refineries in France could also vote to halt production. “We gave an ultimatum to the government, it didn’t listen, so we’re doing exactly what we promised,” Lepine said. “What we are demanding is the withdrawal of the reform.” State officials have begun preparing for another round of union negotiations in the coming weeks before a further national day of protests on 9 January. The government has insisted it will push ahead with attempts to unify the French pension system, arguing that removing 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Opéra de Paris staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any age-related changes. Unions are angry at government plans to introduce a “pivot age” – keeping the legal retirement age at 62 but insisting on an additional two years of work to receive a full pension.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

Emmanuel Lepine works for the CGT. He is in charge of oil workers. He spoke to France Info radio. He said workers at other oil places in France might stop working too. They will vote on it.

Lepine said they warned the government. The government did not listen. So, they are doing what they said they would do. They want the government to stop the new plan. This plan is about pensions.

Government people are getting ready to talk to the unions again. This will happen in the next few weeks. There will be another big protest on January 9th.

The government says they will continue with the new pension plan. They want to make one pension system for everyone. Now, there are 42 different systems. These are for jobs like train workers, energy workers, lawyers, and opera workers. The government says this change is important. It will help the pension system have enough money in the future. More people are getting old.

Some unions like the idea of one system. But almost all unions do not want changes to the age people retire.

The unions are angry. The government wants a ""pivot age."" People can still retire at 62. But they must work two more years to get their full pension."

From a cocktail-making contest to a MasterChef-inspired cook-off, the Guardian spoke to four people about their plans for New Year’s Eve. ‘I think he’s making a daiquiri but he’s not very good’ “I’ll be making a raspberry mojito,” said Elinor, speaking of the cocktail-making contest she and her partner, Richard, both 32, have planned for Thursday night. “I think he’s making a daiquiri, but he’s not very good,” she added. Elinor, who works as an engineer in Glasgow, said the idea came to them as they drew suggestions from a hat. Both of them will also be attending an organised online murder mystery event. “We’ve done one before and they work quite well – you go into Zoom rooms to be questioned then come back together and watch the scenes play out,” she said. “In Scotland we have a tradition to ‘first foot’, which means being someone’s first visitor after midnight – normally bearing gifts such as shortbread and whisky. You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick. It’s horrifying at the moment.” ‘We’ve got to be optimistic’ In Preston, Janet and her husband, now both retired, have got together with neighbours every year for the last 18 years for a Christmas party. Coronavirus has prevented them celebrating this year but they are determined to see in 2021 together. In their cul-de-sac, people from five houses are planning to take fire pits and patios – and their drink of choice – to their front gardens at 11.30pm for a safe, socially distanced party.","The year 2020 is ending. Many people are happy to say goodbye to it. The Guardian newspaper talked to four people about their plans for New Year's Eve.

Elinor and Richard are a couple. They are both 32 years old. They will have a cocktail-making contest. Elinor will make a raspberry mojito. Richard will try to make a daiquiri. Elinor thinks he is not good at it.

They got the idea from a game. They picked ideas from a hat. They will also join a murder mystery game online. They have played this game before. You go into different rooms on Zoom. People ask you questions. Then you come back together and watch the story.

Elinor lives in Scotland. In Scotland, there is a tradition called ""first foot."" This means being the first person to visit someone after midnight. You usually bring gifts like cookies and whisky. You are not supposed to leave your house until someone visits you first. This is a tradition, but Elinor is worried. She does not know how people will do this with Covid. It is hard to follow traditions and stay safe.

Elinor and Richard were sick for the last two New Years. They both had a stomach virus. This year, they think things will be better. They usually have drinks at a friend's house. This year, they want to stop people from getting sick. The sickness is very bad right now.

Janet and her husband are retired. They live in Preston. For 18 years, they had a Christmas party with their neighbors. But this year, they cannot have the party because of the coronavirus. They still want to celebrate the new year together.

People from five houses will have a party outside. They will bring fire pits and chairs to their gardens. They will also bring their drinks. The party will start at 11:30 pm. They will stay far apart to be safe. They want to be optimistic and celebrate the new year."

However, she believes it’s important to celebrate what you can. “I just hope everyone else can have a good time in a small way. It’s making the best of what you’ve got and who you’ve got around you. I think we’ve got to be optimistic.” ‘We need to appreciate what we have’ In London, Hasan Kilani, who is studying for a master’s in transnational queer feminist politics at Soas, is planning a long quiz night with friends on Zoom. “I moved here from Jordan in October and for tonight I’m preparing some questions related to British-Jordanian relations in pop culture,” said the 31-year-old. “Did you know that in 2019 Coldplay chose to release their album in Jordan?” Kilani and his partner are slightly concerned the internet may crash as others plan similar New Year’s Eve events. “I feel the entire world might be doing the same thing,” he said. “We have our own champagne, disco lights, and music playlist so we’ll have our own party and countdown if that happens. “I’m an Arab Muslim so I normally spend this time of year travelling outside Jordan. It’s been a bit disappointing since I arrived in the UK as you always hear that London has a lot of cultural things to offer, but I’ve not been able to experience that yet. I hope next year I’ll be able to see more of the city and that people will be nicer to each other and less toxic. We need to appreciate what we have.” ‘On balance he may be a better cook than me’ Helen, 29, who works in marketing in London said she was “really gunning to win” the MasterChef cook-off she has been preparing for against her boyfriend, Rory, 26. “We’ve been watching the show a lot and started to enjoy cooking more due to lockdown,” she said.","Janet said they will celebrate even if they cannot do much. She said, ""We can toast each other from far away."" Her family had problems because of the coronavirus this year. Her brother got sick but got better. Sadly, another family member died. Janet thinks it is important to be happy about the good things. She hopes everyone can enjoy the new year in a small way. She said, ""We need to be happy with what we have and who we are with. We need to think positively."" She believes people need to value what they have. She will bring champagne and her husband will bring red wine.

Hasan Kilani lives in London and studies at a school. He is planning a quiz night with his friends on Zoom. He moved from Jordan to London in October. He is making questions about British and Jordanian culture. He said that Coldplay released their album in Jordan in 2019. Hasan and his partner are worried that the internet might not work well. They think many people are having online parties. He said the whole world might be doing the same thing. They have champagne, lights, and music. So, they can have their own party if the internet stops working. Hasan is from an Arab Muslim country. Usually, he travels during this time of year. He is sad because he cannot travel this year. He heard London has many interesting things to see. But he could not see them because of the virus. He hopes to see more of London next year. He also hopes people will be kinder to each other. He thinks people need to be thankful for what they have.

11,11_0,0,"In Sydney the fireworks soared into the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour below was empty. In New York, Times Square was mostly deserted. No light show illuminated Beijing from the top of the TV tower. With revelry around the world curtailed by lockdowns and curfews imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19, the lions of London’s Trafalgar Square were barricaded off, and there were no crowds in St Peter’s Square and no one diving into the Tiber in Rome. This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget – one that has seen more than 1.7 million people killed and 82 million infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, whose pyrotechnic display has in the past drawn crowds of a million people to the city’s harbour area, rang in 2021 with a shortened display, with most popular observation spots fenced off and a heavy police presence deterring visitors. Only people who had restaurant reservations or were one of five guests of an inner-city resident were allowed in. “What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands gathered at popular spots across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but were not particularly worried. In New Zealand, too, which has managed to eliminate coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year’s Eve plans proceeded as usual. In Germany, however, where the sale of fireworks has been banned to discourage crowds and authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”, Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final new year’s address as chancellor that she had never found the old year so heavy.","In Sydney, fireworks went up in the sky. They were above the Opera House. But the harbour below was empty. In New York, Times Square had almost no people. In Beijing, there were no bright lights on the TV tower.

Around the world, parties were stopped. This was because of lockdowns and curfews. These rules were to stop Covid-19 from spreading. In London, the lions in Trafalgar Square were blocked off. In Rome, St Peter's Square had no crowds. Nobody jumped into the Tiber River.

This New Year's Eve was different. People said goodbye to a year they wanted to forget. Since January, the coronavirus killed over 1.7 million people. It infected 82 million people.

Sydney usually has a big fireworks show. One million people usually watch it by the harbour. This year, the show was shorter. Most places to watch were closed off. Many police were there to keep people away. Only people with restaurant bookings or guests of city residents could enter.

Gladys Berejiklian is the leader of New South Wales. She said it was a terrible year. She hoped 2021 would be better.

In Wuhan, China, the pandemic started a year ago. Thousands of people gathered in the city center. They waited for the countdown to 2021. Some people were careful, but not too worried.

New Zealand stopped the coronavirus after a long lockdown. New Year's Eve there was normal.

In Germany, you could not buy fireworks. This was to stop big groups of people. In Berlin, police said they would punish anyone breaking the rules. Angela Merkel is the leader of Germany. She said this year was very hard. It was her last New Year's speech as leader."
11,11_1,1,"“And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope,” said Merkel, a trained physicist who won praise for taming the first virus wave but has drawn criticism for soaring infection and death numbers in the second. She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve.","Angela Merkel spoke about the new year. She said that despite problems, she felt hopeful. Some people were worried, and some did not believe in the virus.

Merkel is a scientist. People liked how she handled the first part of the virus problem. But now, many people are sick and dying. Some people do not agree with the rules to stop the virus. They also do not believe the virus is real. Merkel said this is hard for people who have lost loved ones. It is also hard for people who are sick.

The Health Minister, Jens Spahn, said New Year's Eve would be very quiet.

In France, only six adults can be together for dinner. Many police officers will be working. They will stop parties in public places. Some places will not sell alcohol. The police will make sure people stay home between 8 pm and 6 am. This is to stop people from meeting in groups and causing trouble.

Britain had many deaths from the virus. It was because of a new type of the virus. People were told not to have New Year's Eve parties. They should wait until later in 2021. The doctor Stephen Powis said that the virus likes crowds.

He said that staying home and following the rules would help. It would stop the virus from spreading. It would also help the hospitals. He said it is very important to stay home and not meet with other people.

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, also asked people to follow the rules. He wanted people to have a safe New Year's Eve at home.

In London, barriers were put up in public places. This was to stop people from gathering.

Italy has had the most deaths from the virus in Europe. Bars, restaurants, and most shops were closed. People had to stay home between 10 pm and 7 am on New Year's Eve."
11,11_2,2,"Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility. In New York, the New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway but in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said.","Pope Francis could not lead the New Year's services. He had a problem with his leg. The Vatican said his sciatica was hurting him again.

Vladimir Putin is the president of Russia. He spoke on New Year's Eve. He said he wanted Russians to work together. The country is fighting the virus. He knows many people are getting sick again.

Putin said the virus is still a problem. The fight against the virus is still going on. He said many doctors and nurses will be working on New Year's Eve. He asked people to be careful.

In New York, the New Year's Eve ball will still drop. This happens in Times Square. Usually, many people watch it. But this year, it will be different.

Only a small group of people can watch. These people are nurses, doctors, and other important workers. They will stand far apart from each other.

The police are worried about the virus spreading. They closed Times Square to cars and people. They do not want many people to gather there. If people come to watch, the police will ask them to leave. The police chief said people cannot stand there and watch the ball drop."
12,12_0,0,"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","It has been a hard year for many people. It has also been a hard year for the elephants at Elefanjoy. Elefanjoy is a place for elephants in Jaipur, India.

In March, a big problem started. It was the pandemic. The country had a strict lockdown. The elephants could not walk. They usually walk 30 miles each day. These walks are important for their legs. They also help them digest food.

The elephants started to get sick. They also felt sad. The people at the sanctuary also felt sad. Ankit Pareek takes care of Elefanjoy. He said the elephants felt the stress of the people.

The elephants were sad because there were no tourists. Tourists used to walk with them. They washed them and played with them. Tourists also took photos with them. The people at Elefanjoy were worried about the elephants.

Ankit Pareek had another big worry. He needed money from tourists to take care of the elephants. Elephants eat a lot. They can eat 200 kg of food each day. This is about 10% of their weight. It costs 5,000 rupees (£51) each day for one elephant's food.

Ankit Pareek said he did not want the elephants to suffer. He said they deserve love and respect. So, he borrowed money to buy food. He said if tourists do not come back soon, it will be very bad. Ankit has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child.

Some people who care about animals say that training elephants for tourists is bad. It can be cruel. In India and Thailand, many tourists ride elephants. This makes a lot of money. Now, there are no tourists. This is a problem for the elephants.

Some animal lovers hope this problem will stop people from using elephants for tourism. In September, four elephants died. They were trained to give rides to tourists at Amer fort in Jaipur.

The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) said the elephants were tied up all day for months. They did not have enough food or water. This made them very sick, and they died.

Varda Mehrotra works for FIAPO. She said they have been watching how badly the elephants are treated for many years."
12,12_1,1,"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","COVID-19 has made many problems worse. We have been talking about these problems for years. Now, elephants are dying.

Mehrotra said there is a big problem. India only has about eight places for elephants to live safely. These places are called elephant sanctuaries. Most of them cannot take more elephants. Many elephants are now ""out of work"". They are also hungry.

In India, about 1,800 elephants are owned by people. These elephants help people make money. They are used in Hindu festivals called pujas. They also appear in wedding parades. But these events are not happening because of COVID-19.

The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave some money to elephant owners. This happened during the lockdown. But now, they have stopped giving money. Other states did not give any money at all.

Hareshbabu Rengan is 37 years old. He lives in Tamil Nadu. His family owns two elephants named Lakshmi and Kusma. They are 40 years old. He is using social media and a special web page to ask for money. He wants to help his elephants and other elephants that are having problems.

He said he is very worried about elephants in India. People do not want to say they need money for their elephants. They are afraid of being treated badly.

In Thailand, 2,000 elephants lived in tourist camps. Now, people are leaving these elephants. The government gave some help, like food for the elephants. But some camps had to close.

Many elephants left the camps in Thailand. About 1,000 elephants walked back to the villages where their owners lived. These villages were often where the elephants were born. They had not seen these places for many years.

In March, three elephants arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park. The elephants' names were Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah. Their handler asked if he could stay at the park for a short time. The next morning, he was gone.

Later, he called Sangdeaun. He said he did not have enough money to take care of the elephants. Sangdeaun said it is like people leaving dogs at a clinic. She thought this only happened with dogs and cats. Now, people are leaving elephants with her."
12,12_2,2,"Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, the president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said the number of callers asking for veterinary assistance had grown since March. Patitta Traiwet, the president of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has branches across Thailand, said she had managed to maintain the animals’ routine but the elephants had noticed the absence of tourists lining up to give them bananas and pineapples. “They were confused at the beginning – where are the people? Why is nobody feeding me banana?” she said. Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth. Many people now hope that even when the tourists return, these elephants will remain resettled in their natural habitat for good. Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol","Here's the rewritten text at a B2 CEFR level:

Sangdeaun takes care of 97 elephants at her center. Most of these elephants are old. They used to work in riding camps. Now they are saved and live at the center.

The crisis has made elephants cheaper in Thailand. Sangdeaun says the price has gone down a lot. A baby elephant used to cost $100,000 a year ago. Now, it costs only $40,000.

She is worried. Families who took care of elephants for years might sell them. They might sell them to big companies for very little money.

Elephants in camps in Thailand are often chained. They stay chained for a long time. Sangdeaun says they become sad and angry. They sometimes fight each other.

Some camps have fewer mahouts. Mahouts are the people who take care of the elephants. Now, fewer people are taking care of the elephants.

Theerapat Trungprakan works for the Thai Elephant Alliance Association. He says more people are asking for help from vets. This has been happening since March.

Patitta Traiwet runs Elephant Jungle Sanctuary. It has centers in many places in Thailand. She is still doing the same things for the elephants. But the elephants know the tourists are gone.

The tourists used to give them bananas and pineapples. Patitta says the elephants were confused. They wondered where the people were. They wondered why no one was feeding them bananas.

Hundreds of elephants went back home with their mahouts. The coronavirus might have given them a chance to play in the jungle. They can also play in the rivers where they were born.

Many people hope the elephants can stay in their natural homes. They hope this will happen even when the tourists come back.

13,13_0,0,"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","Okay, here's the rewritten text, simplified to be appropriate for CEFR B2 level English:

A new type of the Covid-19 virus spreads quickly in the UK. Scientists think this is because it is easier to pass on. They looked at some tests and found more virus in people with this new type. This supports the idea that it spreads more easily.

This new type is called B117. It was found when cases kept going up in Kent in November. This was during a time when people were staying home. The old types of the virus were going down, but this new type kept spreading.

Some big testing centers started seeing this new type in samples. These centers are in places like London and Manchester. Then, a group of scientists warned everyone about B117. They said it seemed to spread more easily.

Dr. Michael Kidd and his team studied many samples. They looked at tests from people who felt sick. They found B117 along with other types of the virus.

They found that about 35% of people with B117 had a lot of virus in their bodies. Only 10% of people with other types had this much virus. This study has not been checked by other scientists yet.

Dr. Kidd said that people with B117 seem to have more virus. This could mean it is easier for them to give it to other people. But he said they need more information to be sure.

Scientists are quite sure that B117 spreads more easily. Some scientists think it spreads about 56% faster than the old types.

We do not know exactly why it spreads faster. It could be that people need fewer virus particles to get sick. Or, the virus might grow faster in the body. It could also make people able to spread the virus for a longer time.

Dr. Kidd said it's a big question how this new type gets to high amount in the body. He said they need to do more tests in the lab. This will help them understand why it spreads more easily."
13,13_1,1,"“Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death. But a higher rate of transmissibility without strict controls could still lead to more death. • This article was corrected on 30 December 2020. The higher viral load was found in respiratory samples, not blood samples as an earlier version stated.","We need more information to understand this better. Think of it like a puzzle. We need all the pieces.

This study is important. But it is just a first look. We need to do it again.

It gives us an idea about why the virus spreads easily. People with the virus might spread it more easily to others. This is because they are more infectious.

The first information says the UK virus does not make people very sick. It does not mean people will get sick again. And it does not mean more people will die.

But the virus spreads more easily. So, without good rules, more people could still die.

This article had a mistake. We fixed it on December 30, 2020. The virus was found in breath samples, not blood samples."
14,14_0,0,"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Here's the rewritten text, following your instructions:

Hospitals may have to make very difficult decisions soon. They may have to choose which sick people get treatment that could save their lives. Doctors are worried because the NHS is very full.

This warning comes as people ask for a new lockdown in the UK. They also want schools to open later after Christmas. This could help stop the big increase in coronavirus cases.

The NHS is having trouble dealing with many Covid cases. Some patients might not get a bed in the intensive care unit. They might not get a machine to help them breathe. This was said by the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association on Tuesday.

People want the government to do more to fight Covid. Matt Hancock will tell members of Parliament about the rules in England. He will say if the rules are working to stop the virus.

He might announce a new level of rules called tier 5. This would be stricter than tier 4. London and other areas are already in tier 4. He might put areas in tier 3 into tier 4. This is to stop the virus from spreading quickly. On Tuesday, there were a record number of new cases: 53,135. Scotland already has five levels of rules.

More and more hospitals are close to being overwhelmed. They have too many patients who need emergency care because of Covid.

For example, some intensive care units in London are very full. London is the worst affected area in England. Doctors have asked for some patients to be moved to Yorkshire. This is very far away. This is to help the hospitals in London. The Health Service Journal wrote about this.

Another example is the Royal Free hospital in London. It plans to move its children's services to another hospital. This will make more space for adults who are sick with Covid and other illnesses.

The hospital also plans to use the acute admissions unit at Barnet General hospital for Covid patients. Staff were told about this in an email on Tuesday. The Royal Free hospital runs the Barnet General hospital."
14,14_1,1,"A senior manager at the trust, which now has 424 inpatients with Covid, said: “London Gold call has indicated that this position is expected to escalate for the next two weeks with 4 January potentially the zenith of critical care capacity needed.” The Independent Sage committee of scientific and medical experts is urging ministers to instigate an immediate further UK-wide lockdown to try to prevent an imminent “catastrophe”. Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action. Referring to the Tiers review, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: “It will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people to the highest level.” A toughening is needed urgently because pressures on the NHS in some places is “rising at an unsustainable rate”, she said. Keir Starmer sounded a stark warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian that the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January. Dr Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS and president of the HCSA, said ICU staff may end up having to in effect ration who received care that could help them survive. “Our NHS just doesn’t have the beds to cope. Some areas will be overwhelmed in days. If ventilation capacity is exceeded, horrendous choices will have to be made over those who live and die.","A manager at the hospital trust said something important. The trust has 424 patients in the hospital with Covid. The manager said that the situation will get worse for the next two weeks. January 4th might be the worst day for needing critical care.

A group of experts called Independent Sage wants the government to act now. They want another lockdown across the UK. This is to stop a big problem from happening soon. They said that if we wait, many people will die. These people could be saved if we act now.

Sir David King leads the Independent Sage group. He used to be a science advisor for the government. The group also said that schools should stay closed until February. They think that opening schools next week will make things worse. The new type of the virus spreads more easily. It also seems to infect people under 18 more easily.

Christina Pagel is a member of Independent Sage. She also works at University College London. She said that things are very bad right now. She is worried that things will get even worse. We need to act now to stop the NHS from failing in a few weeks. She said that it is a very serious situation.

NHS Providers speaks for hospitals in England. They also want stronger action. Saffron Cordery works for NHS Providers. She said the government needs to make hard choices. They need to move many more people into the highest level of restrictions. She said that we need to act fast. The NHS is under too much pressure in some places. The pressure is growing too quickly.

Keir Starmer is a leader in the Labour party. He gave a strong warning about the NHS and schools. He said that the UK might have a third lockdown in January.

Dr. Claudia Paoloni is a doctor in the NHS. She said that there may not be enough beds in the ICU. Doctors might have to choose who gets the care that could save them. She said that the NHS does not have enough beds. Some areas will be overwhelmed very soon. If there are too many patients needing ventilators, doctors will have to make terrible choices about who lives and dies."
14,14_2,2,"“The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

The doctors will have to make hard choices. They will decide which patients can go to intensive care. Some patients will only get basic care. This means they won't go to intensive care.

Imagine a patient in intensive care who is not getting better. The doctors might have to stop giving them the strongest treatments. This is because another patient might need a haemodialysis machine. But there are not enough machines for everyone. So, the doctors must decide who gets the machine. They also decide who gets a bed with a breathing machine if all the beds are full.

The hospitals might need to stop some other treatments. This could include surgeries for cancer. This is despite promises to keep these treatments going. A hospital might ask: ""Can we do the cancer surgery today?"" They might not have enough beds. They might not have space in intensive care for emergencies. If they use the last bed for cancer surgery, they might not have a bed for an emergency.

It might also be hard to check people for diseases like cancer. People might wait longer for an ambulance to come when they call 999.

The NHS is facing a very big problem. It is the biggest problem in 72 years. Some hospitals are thinking about putting up tents outside. They will use these tents to check patients quickly. There are long lines of ambulances outside many hospitals. The ambulances have patients inside. Sometimes, patients wait for hours in the ambulances before they can go inside the hospital.

On Tuesday, ambulances were waiting in lines outside hospitals. These hospitals included the Royal London hospital and Queen’s hospital in London. Ambulances were also waiting at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.

Dr. Simon Walsh talked about the tent plan. He is a doctor who works in the emergency room. He said using tents is something they usually do after big accidents. For example, they might use them after a terror attack or a big accident at a factory.

NHS workers are getting ready for more patients with COVID. The number of infections is still going up. Dr. Walsh said the government needs a plan to help the NHS. Things are getting very chaotic.

The Doctors’ Association UK said that COVID has made things much worse for the NHS. The NHS is under a lot of stress right now."

ICUs in the south-east are overflowing, with doctors telling us that their hospitals are running out of non-invasive ventilators and even basics like oxygen.” Richard Mitchell, chief executive of the Sherwood Forest group of hospitals in Nottinghamshire, tweeted that: “Today will be a difficult day, tomorrow may be tougher and the next couple of weeks are likely to be the busiest and most challenging we have ever faced in the NHS.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “There is no shortage of ventilators and we have enough oxygen to meet demand. “Throughout this global pandemic we have done whatever it takes to protect the NHS and save lives, including ensuring everyone who needed a ventilator had access to one.”","Dr. Samantha Batt-Rawden is the president of the organization. She said the NHS in the south-east of England has big problems.

Richard Mitchell is in charge of some hospitals in Nottinghamshire. He wrote on Twitter that today will be hard. He said tomorrow might be harder. He thinks the next few weeks will be very busy. He thinks it will be the hardest time the NHS has ever had.

The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango.","During the pandemic, technology helped us keep working and stay calm. But in Barcelona, the lockdowns made something old popular again: books.

Bookstores in the city are selling more books. Some new bookstores have even opened.

One of these new stores is called Llibreria Byron. It was started by a small company that publishes books for schools. It opened in November in the Sant Antoni area.

Mariana Sarrias is one of the owners of the store. She said they planned to open in April, but they could not because of the pandemic.

She said they were worried after waiting nine months. They had spent a lot of money on the store. They named the store Byron because he was a romantic and different person.

When they finally opened in November, many people were waiting outside. The store was too small for everyone. Mariana said it was very emotional. People come to the store every day. She does not know if it is to support them or because the area needed a bookstore.

Maria Carme Ferrer is the head of the booksellers' group in Catalonia. She said the pandemic made people want to help their local bookstores. She said bookstores are important places for culture in the community.

Mariana said that her publishing company saw more orders during the lockdown. Maybe people got tired of watching Netflix. Or maybe people felt lonely and realized books are good friends.

Not long ago, it seemed like bookstores would disappear. In 2013, a famous bookstore called Catalonia closed. It had been open since 1924. A McDonald's restaurant replaced it.

In the same year, Canuda, a big used bookstore, also closed. It inspired the book ""The Shadow of the Wind"" by Carlos Ruiz Zafón. Now, a Mango clothing store is in its place."
15,15_1,1,"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","Maybe this good news is not surprising. This city is the center for selling books in Spain. The people of Catalonia love books. They celebrate this every year on April 23rd. This is the day of Saint George, their special saint. It is also Shakespeare's birthday. On this day, people give each other books and roses. The streets are full of small book stands.

This year, the celebration could not happen because of the sickness. It will probably be small in 2021 too. This is according to Lluís Morral. He manages Laie, a very popular bookstore in the city.

Morral says that they sold more books when people stayed home. People bought old, famous books more than new, popular ones. He said that many people started reading again. They did not want the newest books. They wanted to read books they planned to read before. Many people buy books on Saint George's day, but they don't read them. Now they know they have these books at home. So, they started to read them.

He agrees that being alone made people see that books are good friends. Morral said that many people got tired of watching TV.

Laie and Byron are both bookstores and cafes. They have quiet places to read. This is important because this city is known as the loudest in Europe. Two new stores are also opening. Ona sells books only in the Catalan language. Finestres will open in the spring. They want to be places where people can meet, read, and buy books. Local people who give money helped them start.

Morral hopes they do well. But he knows it will be hard for them. They will have to compete with Amazon, like all bookstores. He said that small bookstores can give personal help. They understand what books you like. They can suggest what you might enjoy reading next. This is better than a computer telling you what to read."
16,16_0,0,"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said.","The French government is getting criticism. Some people think they are trying to please people who don't want vaccines.

Recently, France started giving out vaccines. But only a few hundred people got the vaccine in the first few days.

Health workers in France said they are moving slowly. They said it is like a long race, not a fast one. They are going slowly because many people in France are unsure about the vaccine.

A recent survey said that only about 40% of people in France want to get the vaccine. This number was higher in October. Back then, a little more than half of French people wanted the vaccine.

In Britain, 77% of people are willing to get the vaccine. In the US, 69% of people are willing.

France started giving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday. They started with workers and people living in care homes. They also gave it to people who are likely to get very sick from the virus.

France is different from other countries. They want people to write down that they agree to get the vaccine. This is after they learn about possible problems with the vaccine.

But in the first three days, less than 100 people got the vaccine. By Wednesday evening, health officials said only 332 people had gotten the vaccine.

The health ministry said they want to give the vaccine to 1 million old and at-risk people in January. This means they need to give more than 31,200 vaccines every day.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, said France is giving vaccines slower than other countries. He said this is on purpose. He wants to give people information about the vaccine first. It is not because they don't have enough vaccines or because there are problems with getting the vaccines to people.

Véran said they have the same number of vaccines as Germany. He said they have the same goals and will get the same results.

Véran said it is taking some time to start. He also said that being fast is not the same as being rushed.

The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, and his ministers said the vaccine will not be required. Officials said they will not make a list of people who do not want the vaccine.

But Macron said people should listen to ""reason and science.""

Macron said the vaccine is not required. He said people should trust the scientists and doctors."
16,16_1,1,"In his new year address on Thursday, Macron vowed to avoid “unjustifiable delays” to vaccinations but also struck a defensive note, saying he would let “no one play with the safety” of the campaign. Axel Kahn, a leading geneticist and head of the National League Against Cancer, told Europe 1 radio that France’s vaccine strategy was wrong. “It is not suited to a situation that is so dangerous,” he said. Philippe Juvin, head of the casualty ward at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. “As an individual, I would like to be vaccinated to set an example and show people that we don’t die from the vaccine, we die from Covid. And when we don’t die, we can get severe forms of it that are very disabling,” Juvin told CNews television. Opposition leaders said the slowness of the vaccination programme made France the “dunce” of Europe. Damien Abad, leader of the centre-right opposition Les Républicains in the Assemblée Nationale, demanded an urgent meeting with the health minister. In a letter, other opposition critics wrote: “Mass vaccination is the ultimate means of seeing our country emerge from the damaging economic situation caused by the health crisis. Yet France is vaccinating 10,000 times slower than the UK.” They added: “France cannot be one of the last countries to get vaccinated and yet that’s the picture we’re facing today.” Alain Fischer, the government official overseeing France’s vaccination programme, told Europe 1 the country had chosen to prioritise the elderly and vulnerable, as opposed to health professionals, as in other countries. “There is no good or bad choice … These are small details that will seem ridiculous in two or three months,” he said. Critics say this hesitation is feeding conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxer sentiment. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, said the scientific data was clear. “The vaccine is safe and efficient. Like many of my colleagues, I think we should be giving the vaccines quicker in order to control the epidemic more rapidly. At the rate we’re going, we’ll still be in lockdown in 2022,” he tweeted.","On Thursday, President Macron spoke about vaccines for the new year. He said vaccinations must happen quickly. But he also said safety is most important. He will not let anyone risk safety.

Axel Kahn is a scientist. He leads a group against cancer. He said France's plan for vaccines is not good. He thinks it is not right for a dangerous time.

Philippe Juvin works at a hospital in Paris. He agrees with Kahn. Juvin wants to get the vaccine himself. He wants to show people it is safe. He wants to show that people die from COVID, not the vaccine. He said COVID can make people very sick.

Some leaders disagree with Macron. They said France is vaccinating people too slowly. They think France is the worst in Europe.

Damien Abad is a leader in the government. He wants to talk to the health minister soon. Other leaders wrote a letter. They said vaccines are important for the economy. They said France is vaccinating much slower than the UK. They said France might be one of the last countries to finish vaccinations.

Alain Fischer is in charge of the vaccine program in France. He said France is giving vaccines to old and sick people first. Other countries are giving them to doctors and nurses first. Fischer said there is no right or wrong way. He thinks it will not matter in a few months.

Some people think the slow start is bad. They think it makes people not trust the vaccine.

Nathan Peiffer-Smadja is a doctor in Paris. He said the vaccine is safe and works well. He thinks France should give vaccines faster. He said if they go slowly, they might be in lockdown next year too."

17,17_0,0,"Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","Officials in Gibraltar are checking on the monkeys every day. These monkeys are called Barbary macaques. People worry that the monkeys could get the coronavirus.

Gibraltar is a British place. Not many people there have gotten sick. About 1,500 people had the virus, and six people died.

Governments all over the world are trying to stop the virus. In Gibraltar, the government has another problem. They need to protect the monkeys from the virus. These monkeys are the only wild monkeys in Europe.

Mark Pizarro takes care of the monkeys. He said they knew about this problem from the start. He said that humans and monkeys are similar. If humans can get the virus, monkeys can too.

Earlier this year, the government made new rules. They wanted people to stop touching the monkeys. The monkeys are a popular place for tourists to visit.

In August, they made a new law. It said you cannot touch or bother the monkeys. Before this law, it was already against the rules to feed them. If you fed them, you had to pay a lot of money.

The government said that monkeys can get sick from humans. They said that the monkeys got sick with hepatitis A before.

People think the monkeys have lived in Gibraltar for a long time. They say that as long as the monkeys are there, Gibraltar will stay British.

Sometimes, people have tried very hard to protect the monkeys. During the war, Winston Churchill ordered more monkeys to come from Africa. He wanted to make sure there were enough monkeys.

Now, there are about 220 monkeys.

Recently, they tested four monkeys for the virus. The monkeys had died because of other things, like getting hit by cars. The tests showed that they did not have the coronavirus. This made the government think that the virus is not a big danger to the monkeys.

But in November, people got worried again. Denmark said they would kill many mink because of the virus. The virus changed in the mink, and people worried that the vaccines might not work."
17,17_1,1,"The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal. They interact with themselves, they forage naturally, they spend more time grooming each other, there’s less aggression between the macaques,” said Pizarro. “So there is a lot of positive spin from decreased human contact.”","Here is the rewritten text, simplified to CEFR B2 level:

The government in Gibraltar is worried. Denmark said something that made them anxious. Denmark thinks the monkeys could get the virus. If the monkeys get sick, they could give the virus to people. The virus could also change in the monkeys. This could make the vaccines not work as well.

Pizarro said he has a team. The team has six people. They watch the monkeys every day. They have not seen many signs of the virus in the monkeys.

But the team has seen something else. The pandemic changed things for the monkeys. Less tourism is good for them. Pizarro said the monkeys are acting normal again. They play with each other. They look for food in a natural way. They clean each other more often. They fight less. He said less contact with people is good for the monkeys."
18,18_0,0,"Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy analyst who served three decades in prison for leaking thousands of classified documents to Israel, has arrived in Tel Aviv after being released from parole. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”. The couple are expected to enter several days of quarantine, which is compulsory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of coronavirus.","Jonathan Pollard used to work for the US Navy. He gave secret US documents to Israel. He was in prison for 30 years. After prison, he was on parole. Now, he has arrived in Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv is a city in Israel.

Benjamin Netanyahu is the leader of Israel. He met Pollard and his wife, Esther. They came off a private plane. The Prime Minister's office showed a video of this.

Pollard and his wife are Jewish. They took off their masks. They kissed the ground. Then, they said hello to Netanyahu.

Pollard said they were very happy to be home after 35 years. He was born in the US. But he became an Israeli citizen while in prison. He said he was proud of Israel and its leader.

Netanyahu said a prayer. It was a prayer to thank God for freeing prisoners. Then, Netanyahu gave Pollard Israeli ID papers. He said, ""Welcome home.""

In 1985, the FBI arrested Pollard. He tried to hide in the Israeli embassy in Washington, but it didn't work. In 1987, he was sentenced to life in prison.

This situation caused problems between the US and Israel. They are usually good friends. Pollard being in prison made things difficult. Netanyahu wanted Pollard to be released for many years.

In the 1990s, Pollard became an Israeli citizen. Netanyahu tried many times to get US presidents to let Pollard go. But it didn't work.

Pollard was released from parole last month. This was one of the last things the Trump government did for Netanyahu.

Netanyahu called Pollard last month. He asked when Pollard would come to Israel. He said they were waiting for him.

Pollard's lawyer said it was a dream come true after 35 hard years.

Pollard and his wife must stay in quarantine for a few days. This is required for all people coming back to Israel. It is to protect against the coronavirus."
19,19_0,0,"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that it would be glad to meet the letter’s signatories to discuss reforms. “We know that as a sector we can and must do better,” said chief executive Kate Henderson.","Here's the rewritten text, simplified for a B2 level reader:

Some people are asking social housing companies to care more about people's lives than making money. This comes after a report in a newspaper called the Observer. The report was about a Black woman who lost her home. This happened because her neighbors were racist towards her.

Some important people who used to work in social housing have written a letter. These people are Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin, and Barry Simons. They sent the letter to the National Housing Federation. They say that social housing companies need to do better at protecting people from racism.

The letter asks for a quick change in social housing rules. The rules should make sure that people who are racist are evicted from their homes. Or, the people who are being harassed should be given new homes first.

This group wrote the letter after reading about Laura Tate (not her real name). She has been homeless for five years. She left her home because people threatened to kill her.

The company that owned her home is called London and Quadrant (L&Q). They did not evict the people who were being racist. Even though those people were found guilty of crimes related to racism and public disorder, L&Q did not help Laura find a new home.

Last week, a judge gave Laura £31,000. This was because she sued L&Q for not taking care of her.

The Observer newspaper also wrote about another Black woman. She lived in a women's shelter for two years. She ran away from her ex-partner who was abusive. L&Q did not help her find a new home because she did not have enough proof that she was in danger.

Lord Filkin said that these are not the only cases like this. He said that the people in charge of social housing must make sure that tenants can live safely in their homes. He thinks they need to do more to make this happen.

L&Q gives homes to 250,000 people in the south-east of England. They have said they will check how they handle cases of abuse. This is because of the Observer's report.

L&Q said on their website that they can learn from these cases. They also said they do not allow any kind of discrimination.

The National Housing Federation represents social housing companies. They said they are happy to meet with the people who wrote the letter to talk about changes. Kate Henderson, who is in charge of the Federation, said that they know they can do better."

Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him. No doubt the chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten – who was the last British governor of Hong Kong – will be sympathetic.

Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication.","The Chinese government is trying to make people forget what happened at Tiananmen Square. They are doing bad things to erase the memory. They even took away a statue from a university in Hong Kong.

Many students died at Tiananmen Square. So, universities in other countries should remember them. They should not let their bravery be forgotten.

Student groups in the UK should remember these students. This is especially true for universities with many Chinese students. They could rename a building or part of a building after them.

Some universities did this for Steve Biko. He was a student who fought against bad rules in South Africa. The government killed him. Bradford University used to have a bar named after him. Manchester University still has a building named after him.

Chris Patten is the head of Oxford University. He used to be in charge of Hong Kong. He will probably agree that it is important to remember the students.

Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs.","Some people who don't want vaccines were confused.

Jeff Wyatt was leading the group. He used to work for a political party. He said many people don't want vaccines. He said they have ""woken up.""

Piers Corbyn was also there. He is against lockdowns. He is the brother of Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy used to lead the Labour party.

Piers Corbyn was at other places during the day. The group also went to a theater.

The video showed the group walking to the test center. A man said on a speaker that they give vaccines there. But the sign said ""Testing.""

Some people shouted ""disgrace"" and ""shame on you."" The workers ran away and hid.

A woman took a sign that said ""Reclaim NHS, End Jab."" She took a big box with test things and papers. She smiled at the camera. She was not wearing a mask.

The police know about the protest. It happened in Milton Keynes on Wednesday.

The police said they will take action if crimes happened. They will punish the people who did wrong.

The police asked people to call them if they have information. The phone number is 101. You can also report it online. Use the number 604 29/12/2021.

People said the protesters' actions were bad. Many politicians criticized them."
21,21_1,1,"The local Tory MP Ben Everitt described the protesters as “dickheads” and urged anyone with information to contact police. Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow secretary of state for international trade, described the protest as “dreadful”, at a site where “NHS staff are working over the festive season to help others”. He urged anyone with information to pass this on to Thames Valley police. Former health secretary Matt Hancock criticised the activists’ “appalling behaviour”. The Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, Alicia Kearns, described the scenes as “shameful, self-aggrandising nonsense”. Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said the group’s actions were “totally unacceptable”. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scenes were “disgraceful”. “For months now we have been warning need legislation to tackle those who harass others seeking healthcare. Government promised to act weeks ago but nothing as yet. Enough. It’s not free speech when 50% of debate in fear,” she said. Matthew Barber, police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, said it was “appalling” to see the protest “escalate into something much uglier”. He added that he had spoken to Thames Valley police officers to discuss the police response on Wednesday evening, and said that “criminal offences will be investigated and appropriate action taken”. “All of the events of today will be reviewed to help plan for future protest events and ensure that colleagues in the NHS can continue their fantastic work in delivering the vaccine rollout,” he said. Joe Harrison, CEO of Milton Keynes University hospital, said: “I am very sorry and angry to see NHS colleagues at Milton Keynes Covid testing centre harassed and intimidated at their place of work. “Our staff having to deal with increasing aggression and violence for simply doing their job. It’s abhorrent, unacceptable and we will not stand for it.”","Here's the rewritten text, simplifying the language to a B2 CEFR level while maintaining the original meaning and flow:

Ben Everitt, a politician, was angry about the protesters. He called them names. He asked people to tell the police if they had information.

Nick Thomas-Symonds, another politician, said the protest was very bad. He said NHS workers were helping people at the protest location during the holidays. He also asked people to give information to the police.

Matt Hancock, who used to be in charge of health, said the protesters' actions were terrible.

Alicia Kearns, another politician, said the protest was shameful and silly. She thought the protesters were only trying to make themselves look important.

Helen Morgan, a politician, said the group's actions were wrong.

Stella Creasy, also a politician, said the protest was disgraceful. She said that politicians have been warning that rules are needed for people who bother people getting healthcare. She said the government promised to make rules, but they have not done it yet. She said the government needs to act. She also mentioned that people cannot share opinion freely when others are in fear.

Matthew Barber is in charge of the police in the Thames Valley area. He said the protest got much worse. He talked to police officers about how they handled the protest. He said the police will investigate crimes and take action. They will look at what happened to plan for future protests. This will help NHS workers continue to give vaccines.

Joe Harrison is the boss of the hospital in Milton Keynes. He was sad and angry that people were bothering NHS workers at a COVID testing center. He said that healthcare workers are facing more anger and violence just for doing their jobs. He said this is not okay. He mentioned that the hospital will not accept this behavior."
22,22_0,0,"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","Mudassar Kadir used to work for the BBC in Afghanistan. He had to leave his country because the Taliban took over. He is now in a refugee camp.

He is the only one of 14 BBC workers who got out of Afghanistan. The other 13 are hiding. They are afraid for their lives.

Mudassar also worked for the World Bank and the old Afghan government. He hoped to start a new life with his family after leaving Afghanistan.

He left in October with help from a charity in the USA. Since then, he, his wife, and two young sons have been in a refugee center near Dubai.

The family is thankful to the United Arab Emirates for keeping them safe. They are being taken care of. But they cannot go far from the building. The UAE will not give them asylum.

Mudassar is angry because the UK government has said no to his requests for help. He is still afraid of being sent back to Afghanistan. The Taliban might hurt him because he worked for the BBC.

He said the UK should help him and his family. His life is in danger because he worked for the BBC. He said the UK knows this but is not helping.

At first, he hoped the UK would give him a visa. But now, he is getting more frustrated every day.

Some people are trying to help. They say his situation shows how hard it is for many Afghan people. They cannot go home because they are afraid. They also cannot travel to countries that will take them in as refugees.

The UK government promised a plan to help Afghan people. It is called the Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme (ACRS). It is supposed to help 5,000 people a year, starting in January. There is also another plan called Arap.

Mudassar cannot use Arap. It has only helped a small number of people. He cannot apply for ACRS yet. It is not open. When it does open, only groups can suggest people to be helped.

Some people think the UK government is making the plan start later. They think this is to help fewer people."
22,22_1,1,"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office does not agree with this. A person from the Home Office said the ACRS program is very good. It will help 20,000 people who are in danger to live in the UK. They said they are working hard to start the program. It is a difficult situation. They are working with other groups like UNHCR.

The Home Office will not talk about specific people. When asked why it is taking so long, they said they are working on a system. This system will use things like fingerprints. They need to check who can come to the UK. This is to make sure no one is dangerous to the UK.

The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants is helping Kadir and others like him. They say there is not much time left. Minnie Rahman works there. She said the government promised to help Afghan refugees three months ago. But it seems like they are not helping much.

She said many Afghans like Kadir seem to be left alone by the UK government. They should be helped because they have connections to the UK. The program to help them move is not ready. It is very hard for families to be together. The government does not seem able to help those who worked with them and are in danger.

The National Union of Journalists is asking the government to help Afghan BBC workers get visas. One worker was attacked in October. Michelle Stanistreet works there. She said it is taking a very long time to help. The journalists are scared and hiding. They need to be safe in the UK quickly.

A person from the BBC said they feel bad for the former workers. But they cannot help them directly.

Kadir said he hopes the UK government will do what they promised for him and his family. He said no one seems to care about his case. He has been in the UAE for two months. Nothing has happened to help him.

Kadir's name is not his real name."
23,23_0,0,"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","The new year is coming, but the world has many big problems. These problems include:

*   The Covid-19 virus is spreading again.
*   The climate is changing in dangerous ways.
*   There is a fight between countries with democracy and countries with strong leaders.
*   Many people need help because of bad situations.
*   Many people are moving from their homes.
*   Terrorists are attacking in different countries.

There is also a chance of new wars between countries. It is harder for countries to work together. New weapons that can decide to attack on their own are also a danger.

So, for most people, 2022 will be another year with risks.

**Events in the Middle East**

Things happening in the Middle East will be important news in 2022. Some of this news will be good, and some will be bad.

One good thing is the World Cup in Qatar in November. It is the first time a country in the Arab world has the tournament. This could help the area get more business and visitors. It might also lead to better ways of running the country.

But some people are not happy about Qatar hosting the World Cup. They say there was unfairness in choosing Qatar. They will also watch how Qatar treats people.

Qatar’s treatment of workers who are paid very little is a problem. A newspaper said that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar was chosen in 2010. They died while building stadiums, roads, hotels, and an airport.

People are also worried about Qatar not allowing free speech. They also worry about the rights of women and people who are LGBTQ+. It is dangerous to speak against the government in Qatar. Homosexuality is against the law.

But some experts think that most football fans will not think about these problems. If this is true, the World Cup in Qatar could be a good example of “sports-washing.” This means using sports to make a country look better than it is.

Other problems will still be important in the Middle East. One big question is: Will Israel or the United States do anything to stop Iran from making nuclear weapons? Iran says it is not trying to make nuclear weapons. Israel has said it might attack Iran if talks about the 2015 nuclear agreement fail.

Even football fans would not be able to ignore a war in the Gulf area."
23,23_1,1,"Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level, focusing on simple language and clarity:

**Turkey**

People will watch Turkey closely. The president of Turkey is Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He is seen as a leader who does not allow much freedom. His political party, AKP, has been in power for 20 years in 2022.

Erdoğan has become stricter in his own country. He also has a strong foreign policy. He has had problems with the EU and the US. He sometimes works with Russia about Syria. His poor handling of the economy could cause problems.

**Other Problem Areas**

Lebanon is in danger. It could become like Yemen, a country ruined by war. Libya is also very unstable.

Palestine also needs attention. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, is not popular. He has delayed elections. There is violence from Israeli settlers. They are taking land in the West Bank. There is no progress in peace talks.

**Asia Pacific**

The world will watch China closely all year.

The Winter Olympics will be in Beijing in February. Many people will watch the sports. But some countries like the US and UK will not send officials. This is because they are protesting China's human rights issues. They think China will use the games to show its power.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will have a big meeting later in the year. This is called the 20th national congress. President Xi Jinping wants to stay in power for another five years. This would be his third term. If he gets it, he will be the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

There will be competition for important positions in the government. It might not all go as Xi wants.

Experts disagree about how strong Xi's position really is. China's economy is growing slower. It has a lot of debt. The population is getting older. There are big problems with the environment and climate change. The US is trying to limit China's power by working with other countries. All these things put pressure on Xi.

However, in 2022, China will likely continue to try to increase its power around the world. It will try to grow its economy and influence other countries."
23,23_2,2,"A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister.","A war over Taiwan could change a lot. China's leader, Xi, wants to take back Taiwan. He said he might use any way to do it.

India is China's biggest competitor in the area. India might become more important in the world. Soon, India might have as many people as China. China has about 1.41 billion people. But families in India are getting smaller.

India and China have problems with their border in the mountains. This is dangerous. They fought in 2020 and 2021. Their relationship is getting worse.

Narendra Modi is the leader of India. He is becoming less popular because of the virus and the slow economy. He had to change his plans for farms. People say he uses laws about terrorism to stop people from criticizing him. His party will try to win back support in elections in 2022.

Modi wants India to be closer to the West. He is part of the Quad group with the US, Japan, and Australia. This will make China unhappy.

In Myanmar, the government is hurting people. In Afghanistan, people are suffering after the Taliban took over. Western countries will worry, but they might not do much to help. Afghanistan is in danger. David Beasley from the World Food Programme says many people are starving. The next six months will be very bad.

North Korea might start a war with its nuclear weapons. Kim Jong-un is the leader. He seems worried and is sending unclear signals about war and peace.

The Philippines will choose a new leader. Rodrigo Duterte is the current leader, but he can only be leader for one term.

Scott Morrison wants to be the leader of Australia again."
23,23_3,3,"Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine.","Europe: A Difficult Year

This year will be very important for Europe. Leaders in the EU and in countries will face many problems. These problems include disagreements inside and outside Europe. The pandemic is still causing problems for people and the economy. Migration is also a challenge.

After the COP26 meeting, countries promised to have zero emissions. This is a new challenge for Europe.

Europe needs to decide what it wants to be in the world. Does it want to be important? Or will it let China, the US, and countries like Russia have more power? Russia is led by Vladimir Putin.

The elections in France and Hungary in the spring will be important. Right-wing groups are pushing ideas that divide people.

Viktor Orbán is the leader of Hungary. He has not followed the rules about law, democracy, and free speech. Now, for the first time, he will face a group that is against him. People in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and other EU countries will watch what happens. In these countries, right-wing parties are also strong.

Emmanuel Macron is the leader of France. He wants to be president again. He will run against Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Some people say these rivals have racist ideas and are against Muslims.

Polls say Macron is ahead. But he may also face a challenge from Valérie Pécresse. She is the first woman to lead the Republican party. The left-wing parties are not doing well. The election could make France more right-wing.

There will also be elections in Sweden, Serbia, and Austria.

Germany has a new government led by the SPD party. People will watch to see if it does things differently after Angela Merkel was leader for many years. The new government might have problems with the European Commission. Ursula von der Leyen leads the Commission. She is a friend of Merkel. Germany might also have problems with France and other countries about money and debt.

France will lead the EU in January. Macron will try to push his ideas about defence and security. He calls this ""strategic autonomy.""

Macron believes Europe needs to protect itself in a dangerous world. This will be tested in places like Ukraine."
23,23_4,4,"Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world.","Here's the rewritten text at a B2 level, following your instructions:

**Europe**

Experts think Russia might cause trouble soon. They are moving many soldiers to the border. Russia might also use nuclear weapons as a threat. This could cause a new war. NATO might not help much.

Other problems are happening too. Belarus is using people who want to move to Europe as a weapon. There is no good plan for helping these people across Europe. Also, some groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans want to break away from their countries. This could cause fighting.

The European Union (EU) is planning a meeting with China. But the EU countries do not agree on how to deal with China. Some want to do business, but others want to talk about human rights.

Britain is getting poorer and more alone. People who voted to leave the EU (Brexit) are starting to regret it. This problem will likely get worse.

Britain's relationship with the United States is not good. The US does not want Europe to be too independent. The US also seems unsure about what to do about Ukraine. This could cause problems between the US and Europe.

NATO's reputation is bad after what happened in Afghanistan. They need a new leader. It is likely that a woman will be chosen for the job for the first time. Some people think Theresa May, the former British Prime Minister, might be chosen. But France probably will not want someone from Britain.

**Latin America**

Brazil will have important elections in October. It will be a big fight to defeat Jair Bolsonaro. He is the current president and has right-wing political ideas. This election will affect other countries too.

Many people in Brazil are angry at Bolsonaro. They think he handled the COVID-19 pandemic badly. Over half a million people in Brazil have died from the virus. Only the US has more deaths.

People outside Brazil also dislike Bolsonaro. They are angry because he does not care about climate change. He is also letting people destroy the Amazon rainforest quickly.

Polls show that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will probably win the election if he runs. He was president before. He was in jail for corruption but was later found not guilty.

But some people are worried that the election might not be fair. Supporters of Donald Trump in the US are helping Bolsonaro. They are teaching him how to cheat in the election or take over the government, like Trump tried to do in the US. People worry that other leaders around the world will try to do the same thing."
23,23_5,5,"Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision.","Here is the text rewritten in simple English, suitable for a B2 level learner:

Some studies in Europe show that fewer people support right-wing politicians. But this might not be true in South America, except for Brazil. It may also not be true in other developing countries in 2022.

Populism happens when there is a big difference between rich leaders and regular people. In many poorer countries, this difference is getting bigger. This is about money and power.

In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who said they would help people have become bad rulers. This problem may continue.

In Chile, there was an election. José Antonio Kast got a lot of support in the first part of the election. He was a politician on the right and liked Pinochet, a former leader. But he lost to Gabriel Boric. Boric is a leftist. He used to be a student leader. He won the election and will be the youngest leader of Chile.

Argentina's president, Alberto Fernández, has problems. It looks like the next year will be hard. His political party, the Peronists, lost in the elections. This party is very old. They lost control of Congress for the first time in 40 years.

Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will have problems with the US. These problems are about trade, drugs, and people moving from Central America. But at least he does not have to deal with insults from Trump anymore, for now.

In North America, everyone will watch the elections in November. The Democrats will try to stop the Republicans from taking control of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

The results of these elections will show what people think of Joe Biden, the president. If the Republicans do well, Donald Trump might run for president again in 2024. He still says he won the 2020 election, but this is not true.

Some issues are important all over the country. These are: how well we are dealing with the pandemic, people who don't want to get vaccinated, the economy, prices and interest rates going up, and social issues like immigration, race, and abortion. The Supreme Court might change the Roe v Wade decision from 1973, which protects abortion rights. They might make it weaker."
23,23_6,6,"The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September.","Here's a rewritten version of the text, adjusted for CEFR B2 level English:

The Democratic party has problems. One big problem is that the party is divided. There are two groups: progressives and moderates. They disagree on many things.

This disagreement caused problems for President Biden. He wanted to pass laws about social care and infrastructure. But the two groups in his party could not agree. The laws were changed to be weaker.

People are watching President Biden. They want to know if he will run for president again in 2024. He will be 80 years old in November. Some people wonder if he is too old. They also wonder if he can still do his job well. His popularity is low right now. It may be hard for him to become more popular.

Vice-President Kamala Harris is also being watched. Some people say she is not doing a good job. They say she seems unhappy. Some people may want to cause problems for her and President Biden.

Pete Buttigieg is the transportation secretary. He wanted to be president in 2020. People are watching him too. He could replace Kamala Harris or even President Biden. This could happen if Biden only stays president for one term.

Some people are worried about the midterm elections. They are not sure if the elections will be fair. Republicans are trying to make it harder for some people to vote. They are also changing voting areas to help Republicans win.

One study says Republicans will win at least five more seats in the House of Representatives. This is because of the changed voting areas. It could mean Republicans will control the House, even before people vote.

Many people from Central America want to come to the US. They are going to the southern border. This will be a big problem in 2022. Kamala Harris is in charge of dealing with this problem. But some people say she is not doing a good job. People say that Biden and Harris are using the same harsh rules as Trump.

People are also worried about President Biden because of Afghanistan. The US left Afghanistan in a hurry. Many people thought this was a failure. It made Biden look bad.

Other things could also cause problems for Biden. A war or conflict in another country could involve the US. This could ruin Biden's time as president. For example, Russia could invade Ukraine. China could attack Taiwan. Or Israel and Iran could start a war.

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won the election. He wants to make new rules about childcare and housing. He wants to make them more affordable."
23,23_7,7,"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

**Canada**

In 2021, there was a quick election. Justin Trudeau's Liberal party won. But they did not get many votes from the people. It was the lowest number of votes for a winning party ever. This means people may not like Trudeau as much now.

There are some problems. People are talking about possible unfair behavior. They also disagree about how the government handled the pandemic. Trade with the United States is another issue. The plan to reduce carbon is also causing arguments.

**Africa**

Africa is a big continent. Big events will happen there in 2022. One important issue is vaccines. Many Africans are not vaccinated. Rich countries have most of the vaccines. They are not sharing extra vaccines or patents. This could hurt Africa's health and economy.

Will this selfishness hurt rich countries later? Gordon Brown, a former UK leader, thinks so. The Omicron virus started in South Africa. This shows new viruses can appear in 2022. Rich countries might only protect themselves. They might not work together with other countries.

We do not know what will happen with the pandemic in 2022. It could affect health and money everywhere. In Africa, many people are young. They might not get very sick from Covid. But the bigger problem could be other diseases.

About 25 million people in Africa will have HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria kills almost 400,000 people each year. It might be harder to treat these diseases. Covid has made the healthcare systems weaker. This can also affect treatments for other diseases, like TB and diabetes.

Some people think Africa is now the main place for terrorism. This will probably continue in 2022. The Sahel area has many radical groups. These groups are mostly from Africa. But they say they support groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western countries may try harder to fight this violence in 2022."
23,23_8,8,"This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought.","The leaders of the US and France made an agreement to work together. This happened after France stopped its military actions in Mali because they did not have enough support.

Many countries are worried. They see dangerous ideas from radical Islamist groups spreading in West Africa. These ideas are going from countries like Nigeria to places like Congo and Mozambique.

Somalia is a country that is not doing well. A group called al-Shabaab is causing problems there. Somalia shows what can happen when terrorism is not stopped. This is a warning for other countries.

The US will have a meeting about democracy. The meeting will talk about how countries are governed. This is a big issue, especially in Africa. Several countries in Africa had changes in government in 2021. Sudan is one example.

Poverty is also a big problem. It is connected to the way countries are governed. The International Rescue Committee says that many countries in Africa are at risk of having very bad problems.

They say that the following countries are at risk: Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger, and Cameroon.

Other countries that are also at risk include Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, and Venezuela.

In the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia has many problems. There is a civil war that is getting worse. This war could break up the country. The country next to Ethiopia, Eritrea, is also causing problems.

The United Nations says that there will be a bad drought in Somalia. This drought will put many people at risk. About 7.7 million people in Somalia could be in danger by April.

UNICEF is a charity that helps children. They are asking for a lot of money to help people around the world. They need $9.4 billion to help over 327 million people. This includes 177 million children. These people are having problems because of wars, sickness, and other bad things.

All these problems are making another big problem worse: migration. People are leaving their homes for different reasons. Some people are refugees because of war. Other people are asking for asylum because they are being treated badly. Some people are leaving because of climate change, hunger, and drought."
23,23_9,9,"The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

In 2020, a lot of people lived in countries that were not their own. The UN says this number was 281 million. That is about 3.6% of all the people in the world. This is a record number.

The number of migrants is still increasing. This is happening even though it is difficult to travel between countries because of the pandemic.

Many people are moving to different countries. But governments are not working together to handle this situation. Rich countries in North America and Europe especially need to do more. Maybe things will get better in 2022. But it might not happen.

The next big meeting about the climate is called Cop27. It will be in Egypt in November. This meeting will check on the promises made in Glasgow at Cop26. Countries promised to reduce carbon and methane. They also promised to stop cutting down forests, use less coal, and stop giving money to fossil fuels. Rich countries also promised to help poor countries with the damage caused by climate change.

We should not expect the climate to improve quickly. The extreme weather from 2021 will likely happen again. There will be fires, droughts, floods, storms, and very hot temperatures.

These problems will be worse in places that are already weak, like Antarctica and the Arctic. There will be more human activity in these areas in 2022. This might not be a good thing.

More tourists are visiting Antarctica. Big planes can now land there. China and other countries want to use Antarctica's resources and build military bases there. This is also a problem.

The ice in the Arctic is melting. This is opening up new shipping routes for businesses and the navy. Russia is building these routes. Other countries are competing with Russia.

Greenland has many minerals. Mining companies want to use them. Defence planners are also interested in Greenland. But people who live there do not want to give out mining licenses.

There will be a lot of activity in space this year. Countries will explore space and compete with each other for military reasons.

NASA will have 18 missions in 2022. They want to send people back to the moon. They are also planning a new space station called Gateway. Russia, South Korea, India, and Japan will send spaceships to the moon. The European Space Agency will send a mission to Mars."
23,23_10,10,"China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind.","Here's the rewritten text, aimed at a CEFR B2 level:

China wants to finish building its space station this year. The space station will orbit the Earth.

At the same time, space tourism is becoming popular. Russia and companies like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are offering trips to space. Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos own these companies.

But there are also worries about weapons in space. Countries like the US, Russia, and China are testing new weapons. These weapons could launch nuclear missiles from space. This could start a dangerous arms race.

Russia made people angry when it tested a missile that could destroy satellites. This test happened in 2021. Other countries might do the same thing. This could damage how we communicate around the world.

NASA has a plan to protect Earth. They want to hit a big asteroid to change its path. They will use a spacecraft to crash into the asteroid. The spacecraft will be launched by a rocket from SpaceX, Elon Musk's company.

The US calls this ""planetary defense."" But the same technology could be used to attack other things in space.

Some people think this is progress. Others think it is a bad step for everyone."
24,24_0,0,"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails.","It is shocking how many UK scientists and doctors have been abused. These people give advice to the government about the pandemic.

A survey in The Guardian newspaper looked at this problem. Many experts said they were attacked online. Some even received death threats.

Some people took photos of the experts' houses. They shared these photos online. Some experts got strange packages in the mail. These packages had messages written on them.

The experts also received nasty messages. These included angry tweets, emails, and phone calls. Some people sent hate mail and threatened violence. They complained to the experts' bosses. Some even contacted the General Medical Council, a group that watches over doctors. People left mean notes on the experts' cars. They shouted insults through their doors.

The police have arrested some people who made specific threats.

The abuse did not only target the experts. Their students, coworkers, and families were also targeted. This included their partners and children.

One expert works as a doctor. The doctor said that people were very rude to the receptionists at the doctor's office. This happened because of the doctor's role as an advisor.

In another case, a teacher targeted an expert's child. The teacher blamed the parent for the government's rules about staying home. The family did not complain because the child needed the teacher to give them a good grade.

The Guardian sent the survey to over 100 scientists, doctors, and researchers. These people help advise the government. They work with groups like SAGE, Nervtag, and JCVI.

The answers to the survey are kept secret. Three out of four people who answered said they were abused. This was because of the government's rules, their science opinions, or their research. This often happened after they spoke to the news or at public events.

Professor John Edmunds is an expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He is also a member of SAGE. He wrote in The Guardian that he and his staff often receive abusive emails."
24,24_1,1,"“If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers.","If you talk about vaccines in the news, people might react. This is especially true if you talk about vaccines for children. But this usually happens if a newspaper like the Daily Mail writes about your comments.

One advisor got a death threat on Twitter. They told the police about it. They also got a lot of mean messages when they were on TV or in the newspaper.

One doctor said that a lot of the messages were mean to women. They said the messages were very bad. The doctor said they had never seen anything like it before. They just wanted to help stop people from dying.

Some people are more worried about the government's actions than about the virus itself. These people are often the ones who send the mean messages. But the advisors do not make the rules.

Advisors say the mean messages get worse when they talk about masks, vaccines, and treatments for COVID. It also gets worse when they talk about short lockdowns. This means it is getting worse as the Omicron virus spreads.

At the start of the virus problem, advisors got many threats. Government security experts told them how to stay safe. They told them how to make their computers safer. They also told them to change when they go to work and what roads they use. They also said to check under their car before they drive.

Some advisors had their homes and offices checked for safety. They got alarms and cameras that are watched all the time. The cameras are connected to the police.

Some universities hired security guards to help the experts. The guards make sure protestors do not bother the experts.

Government experts have taken down some private information from the internet. But they cannot always do this.

Many advisors got hateful messages on Twitter and email. Some messages said, ""I hope your family dies."" Other messages used bad words and said the advisors were killing children with vaccines.

Some news companies made the problem worse. They talked about the worst things that could happen. Some news companies also attacked the advisors. This made the mean messages from people online seem okay."
24,24_2,2,"The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”","Here's the rewritten text at a B1/B2 CEFR level:

The study did not find proof that women were abused more than men. But some women did not want to talk about what happened to them.

Many men were sad about the bad things said to women they knew. One man said that women seem to get much more abuse than men.

Even with all the bad comments, some experts said they also got good comments. People thanked them and supported them. This made the bad comments less important. One expert said that the hate did not bother him much anymore.

George Freeman, who is in charge of science, said the abuse was very bad. He said we all need to say this is wrong because we care about freedom. He also said that scientists should not be blamed for choices made by the government. The government is in charge of making decisions.

Chi Onwurah said the attacks were not okay. She said the government needs to help stop wrong information online. The government bill to do this is taking too long.

Many experts said that the Cabinet Office and the Sage team helped them a lot. But some experts said they wished they had been told about the abuse beforehand. They also wanted advice on how to stay safe.

Because of the attention, some scientists are staying quiet. They do not want to talk to the media or share their thoughts. But most scientists said the abuse did not change them. Some even said it made them stronger.

One expert said the abuse made him want to talk more. He felt like people were listening to him and that he was making a difference.

Another expert said that if they stop talking, bad information will spread. He asked if they should let bad information take over and risk people’s lives."
25,25_0,0,"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban].","Here's a rewritten version of the text using simpler language and shorter sentences, suitable for a CEFR B2 learner:

Ashraf Ghani used to be the president of Afghanistan. He has spoken for the first time since he left Kabul four months ago. He blames other countries for what happened in Afghanistan. He especially blames the United States. He says they caused the fall of the Afghan government.

Ghani spoke to the BBC. He said he had to leave Kabul quickly in a helicopter. His security advisor, Hamdullah Mohib, told him to go. Mohib was very scared. The head of the presidential security was also scared. Ghani said they told him the security guards had failed. They said if he stayed, they would all be killed. Mohib gave him only two minutes to decide.

Ghani was talking to Nick Carter. Carter used to be the head of the British army. He was in charge of a BBC radio show for one day.

The Taliban were taking control of Afghanistan. This happened before Ghani left. When Ghani left quickly, it stopped any chance of a peaceful change of power. This also stopped aid money from coming to Afghanistan. Plans for a government with different groups also failed.

Now, many people in Afghanistan are hungry. The country's economy is much smaller. The health system and schools are in trouble. This is because foreign money stopped coming. They depended on this money.

Carter asked Ghani what he would say to the Afghan people. Many people blame Ghani for the problems in Afghanistan. Ghani said his biggest mistake was trusting Afghanistan's allies. He said he trusted the international community too much. He thought they would help for a long time, but they did not.

Ghani said the United States did not include his government in peace talks with the Taliban. He said the US made deals with the Taliban. These deals were made to help US troops leave easily. He said this hurt the Afghan people. He said the US team is responsible. He said they never let him talk to the Taliban."
25,25_1,1,"Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue. They erased us.” Khalilzad said in his own interview with the Today programme that the collapse of the republic was due to a “failure of Afghan leadership” and Afghan troops that did not “resist hard” against the Taliban. Six months ago the two men were among the most influential figures shaping Afghanistan’s future; now neither are willing to accept any responsibility for the tragedy stalking the country. Carter asked the former president about any personal regrets that had surfaced in the last 100 days. Ghani did not mention the humanitarian crisis, but he lamented the damage to his reputation and legacy. “My work has been destroyed. My values have been trampled on, and I’ve been made a scapegoat.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR B2 level:

Ambassador Khalilzad talked with them. It was not just about Afghanistan anymore. It was now about America too. ""They forgot about us,"" Khalilzad said in an interview. He said Afghanistan fell apart because the Afghan leaders were not good. He also said the Afghan soldiers did not fight hard enough against the Taliban.

Six months ago, these two men were very important. They helped decide what would happen in Afghanistan. Now, they do not want to be blamed for the bad things happening there.

Carter asked the former president if he felt sorry about anything in the last 100 days. Ghani did not talk about the people who need help. He said his name and what he did were ruined. ""My work is gone,"" he said. ""My ideas are not respected. People are blaming me for everything."""
26,26_0,0,"Thousands of South Africans will pause to remember the anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90, every day this week as bells are rung at churches across the country for 10 minutes at noon. Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country.","This week, many South Africans will remember Desmond Tutu. He was a famous person who fought against apartheid. Apartheid was a system that treated people of different races unfairly. Desmond Tutu died on Sunday. He was 90 years old.

Every day this week, bells will ring in churches. The bells will ring for 10 minutes at 12 o'clock. This is to honor Desmond Tutu. People all over the world are remembering him. They say he was a very good man. He helped his country a lot.

Barack Obama, who used to be the president of the United States, said Desmond Tutu cared about fairness. He wanted everyone to be treated well.

Desmond Tutu won a big award called the Nobel Prize. His body will be shown to the public for two days. Then, on January 1, there will be a funeral. The funeral will be at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town. This was Desmond Tutu's church.

The bells at the church will ring every day at 12 o'clock. This will happen until Friday. People will also have special services to remember him. Flags will be lowered to show respect.

Archbishop Thabo Makgoba said that the bells will ring in many churches. He also said that people in Cape Town will say a special prayer.

South Africa still has problems. There is inequality, and people have different political ideas. But Desmond Tutu's death has brought people together.

Many people have visited St George's Cathedral. They want to remember Desmond Tutu. They are leaving flowers and signing a book. Miriam Mokwadi, who is 67, said that Desmond Tutu was a hero. She said he fought for them. She said that South Africa is free because of him. She said they would have been lost without him."
26,26_1,1,"He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo. Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party.","Here's the rewritten text at a B1/B2 CEFR level:

The South African cricket team played a game against India. They wore black bands on their arms to honor Tutu. Table Mountain in Cape Town was lit up with purple light to remember him.

Cyril Ramaphosa is the President of South Africa. He said Tutu was very smart, honest, and strong against the unfair system of apartheid.

Ramaphosa said Tutu's death is a sad time for the country. South Africa is saying goodbye to many important people who helped make the country free. FW de Klerk, another leader from the time of apartheid, died in November.

Graça Machel is Nelson Mandela's widow. She said, ""It took great courage to fight for freedom in South Africa.""

Tutu did not appear in public often lately. But he still fought for what he believed in. He supported equal rights for LGBT people. He wanted everyone to have equal education. He also supported the right to choose when to die.

Tutu was a popular religious leader. He laughed a lot and was easy to talk to. But he was also very strong in his beliefs. He often criticized the political party in charge of South Africa, the African National Congress."
26,26_2,2,"Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer.","The rules about Covid in South Africa say that only 100 people can go to a funeral. Church leaders said that not everyone who wants to come to the funeral can fit in the church.

The funeral will be a special church service. It is what Desmond Tutu wanted. Michael Nuttall will lead the service. He used to be a bishop. People called him ""number 2 to Tutu"".

Nuttall and Tutu were very close in the 1980s. They showed how a white leader and a black leader could work together. Church leaders told reporters about this.

Tutu was born in a small town. The town is called Klerksdorp. It is near Johannesburg. He was born on October 7, 1931.

He used to be a teacher. He quit his job because he did not like the unfair laws in South Africa. This was in 1958. The unfair system of laws was called apartheid. It started ten years before.

Tutu studied religion in England. He sometimes asked police officers for directions, even when he knew the way. He did this to see if they would call him ""Sir"". This was important because he was Black and the police were white.

Tutu became more and more important in the church. In the late 1970s, he was a leader in the fight for freedom. Many people in other countries knew about him. He helped make leaders in other countries think about the bad things that were happening in South Africa. These leaders were supporting the white leaders in South Africa, even though it was wrong.

In 1984, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize. He believed in fighting without using violence. After that, he became the leader of the church in Cape Town.

In 1994, South Africa had its first free elections. Nelson Mandela became president. Tutu called South Africa the ""Rainbow Nation"". He led a group that told the truth about the bad things that happened during apartheid.

Tutu also spoke out against the new leaders of South Africa. He told Mandela that government leaders were getting paid too much money. He also criticized President Jacob Zuma, who was president until 2018. People said that Zuma was stealing money.

Tutu found out he had cancer in 1997. He had treatment many times. He did not appear in public very often anymore."

27,27_0,0,"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","Here's a B2-level rewrite of the text, following your instructions:

The year was very bad for human rights in Russia. A big problem was that Alexei Navalny, an important leader against the government, was put in jail. Another big problem was that the group International Memorial was shut down. This was a very harsh action.

International Memorial started in the 1980s. Andrei Sakharov and other people who disagreed with the Soviet government created it. At that time, the Soviet Union was starting to allow more freedom. The group used this freedom to find out the truth about what happened to many people under Stalin. Stalin was a leader who killed or hurt millions.

The group was a sign that Russia was becoming more open. It helped Russians learn about the sad stories of their families. For many years, these stories were secret because the government was afraid to tell the truth.

Closing Memorial shows that Russian society is changing very quickly. The leaders of Memorial thought people would support them. They hoped important people, like Gorbachev, would help them. They also thought the government would not close a group that was finding out about bad things from the past. They believed that would be too much, even for President Putin.

But on Tuesday, a judge decided to close the group. This was almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union ended. Nikita Petrov helped start Memorial. He is a historian who studies the past. He told a newspaper that he never thought things would get so bad. He said he was probably too hopeful in the past.

It is easy to see why President Putin does not like Memorial. He is very concerned about the past, like Crimea, NATO, and the end of the Soviet Union. He thinks that looking into the past of the Soviet Union is a danger to Russia. He cares more about things he thinks were unfair to Russia in the past. He does not care about the truths that Memorial found in the Russian archives.

After the group was closed, Memorial said something. They said that Russia needs to understand its past honestly. They think this is important for the future."
27,27_1,1,"In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","Instead of Memorial, the government wants something different. Memorial talked strongly about terrible things that happened to many people. The new group will talk about deaths in a more careful way.

This new group will say the deaths were bad. But it will not say who killed the people. It will name the people who died, but not the people who did the killing.

The Russian government wants people to think closing Memorial was simple. They say it was because of rules about ""foreign agents.""

But in court, a lawyer showed the real reason. He said Memorial was lying about the USSR. He said Memorial was saying the USSR was like a terrorist country.

The lawyer asked why people should see traitors being praised. He said these traitors helped the Nazis.

A lawyer for Memorial said this reminded him of a trial from the 1930s. These trials were not fair.

The people who lead Memorial do not know why the government closed them. They do not know what they did wrong.

Some people think it is because of Memorial's work about Soviet terror. Others think it is because Memorial helps political prisoners like Navalny.

But Memorial has always done the same thing. Russia has changed. Russia used to let people talk honestly about the past. Maybe that time is over.

Kenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch said something important. He said the government is afraid of the honest stories Memorial tells.

He said the government does not want to see the truth about what it did. He said if the truth is too bad, the government should change its actions. It should not try to hide the truth."
28,28_0,0,"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","Some towns in Spain are starting to offer ""menstrual leave"" to their workers. This is new in Europe. Menstrual leave means women can take time off work when they have pain from their periods.

The city of Girona in Spain was the first to think about this. They wanted to help workers who felt bad because of their periods.

In June, Girona made an agreement with its workers. The agreement said women, trans men, and non-binary people could take up to eight hours of menstrual leave each month. But, they have to work those hours back within three months.

Maria Àngels Planas is the deputy mayor of Girona. She said Girona is doing something new by approving menstrual leave. She said they are talking openly about periods and the pain some women have.

After Girona, two other towns in Spain, Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques, also made similar rules.

In September, the city of Castellón de la Plana said they also agreed to menstrual leave. They have 1,500 workers. The workers asked for this rule. It is like the rule in Girona.

In some countries in Asia, menstrual leave has been a law for a long time. This is because people thought work could make it harder for women to have babies.

In 2016, a newspaper talked to women in Japan and China. The women said they did not want to use menstrual leave. They were worried that men at work would be angry. They also thought it could hurt their chances of getting a better job.

In 2016, a company in England called Coexist also started offering menstrual leave. They wanted to change the work culture. Before, women had to choose between working when they felt very bad or using sick days.

This idea caused a lot of discussion around the world. But, the managers at Coexist said workers were more dedicated and worked better. Studies showed that many women have missed work or school because of their periods.

The workers union in Girona thought about all of this when they suggested menstrual leave."
28,28_1,1,"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","Sílvia Rubio works for a union called Intersindical-CSC. She said there were many problems with a new idea.

At first, the union wanted women to have two days off each month. But some people did not like this idea. They thought companies might not want to hire women. They worried companies would not give women important jobs.

Rubio said they changed the idea to stop unfairness. Now, women can take hours off, but they must work those hours later.

It was hard to talk to the city council. The union first wanted 16 hours off each month. But they had to change it to eight hours.

Some people in the union did not like the idea either. This was surprising. Rubio said there were arguments.

Some women said their husbands have headaches. They asked why men could not have the same time off. Other women worried the idea would make women look bad. They thought it would make periods seem like something always painful.

Rubio said this is a big step forward. She said it is a women's issue all over the world. Many people are embarrassed to talk about it. She said they did something important.

Rubio does not want the work to stop here. She thinks this idea is a beginning. It can help make workplaces better. People can be more flexible with problems like sickness or taking care of family.

Rubio wants to make workplaces better for everyone. This includes both women and men. It includes jobs in the government and in private companies."
29,29_0,0,"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has a record number of new COVID-19 cases. This is a record for France and for Europe. The Omicron variant is making cases increase quickly.

On Wednesday, France said there were 208,000 new cases in one day. The day before, there were almost 180,000 cases. That was also a record.

The health minister said that every second, two people in France are getting the virus. He said they have never seen so many cases. He called the increase ""very fast.""

The health minister said that hospitals in France are already worried because of the Delta variant. He said that Omicron will also affect the hospitals soon.

The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Greece also have new records for cases this week. In the US, there are also many new cases. On Tuesday, the average was 267,000 new cases per day. Omicron is 59% of these cases.

In Australia, there were almost 18,300 new cases on Wednesday. This is more than the old record of 11,300 cases. The Prime Minister said Australia needs to change how they are dealing with the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that Delta and Omicron are spreading at the same time. This is causing many new infections. More people may need to go to the hospital and some people may die.

The head of the WHO said he is worried that Omicron is spreading fast. He said it is like a ""tsunami"" of cases because it is happening at the same time as Delta.

The WHO said Omicron is a ""very high"" risk. It could make hospitals unable to help everyone.

Studies say Omicron might not be as dangerous as other versions of the virus. However, many people are getting sick. Hospitals in some countries might get too full. Businesses may have problems because workers have to stay home.

The new variant spreads very quickly. Governments are trying to find a good way to stop the virus and keep the economy working. They want to protect hospitals, but they also want people to be able to work and live normally."

The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”.","Spain has changed its COVID rules. People who have COVID now only need to stay home for seven days instead of ten. This is because many new people are getting sick. Businesses worry they will not have enough workers.

Italy has also made some changes. People who have had three COVID vaccine shots do not need to stay home if they are near someone with COVID. But, Italy has made rules stricter for people who have not been vaccinated. Starting January 10, people need a health pass to travel. This pass shows they have had the vaccine or got better from COVID. You will need it for buses, trains, and planes inside Italy. A plan to make rules stricter for unvaccinated workers was not approved. Italy reported a lot of new COVID cases on Wednesday, 98,030 in one day.

In France, lawmakers are talking about a new law. This law would only let people with vaccines go to certain places. These places include bars, restaurants, movie theaters, and sports places. You would not be able to use a negative COVID test to enter.

Italy and other countries have stopped or made changes to public parties because COVID is spreading again.

Greece has also stopped Christmas and New Year's parties in public. They now have new rules for restaurants and bars. These rules started earlier than planned. Greece had many new COVID cases, 21,657 in one day. This is more than double the number from Monday. Bars, clubs, and restaurants must close at midnight. People cannot stand up inside, and there is no music. But on New Year's Eve, they can stay open until 2 AM. The health minister said these rules should help them get back to normal in mid-January.

Some countries are waiting for the Omicron wave of COVID to arrive. In Germany, the number of COVID cases is going down. But the health minister said the real number might be higher. This is because fewer people are getting tested during the holidays. He thinks the real number of cases is two or three times higher than what they reported. He said the number of cases is expected to go up soon."
29,29_2,2,"On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors. It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events. Lauterbach said the rules may have to be toughened further, as existing measures “will not be enough to prevent a significant rise in Omicron cases”. In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated.","On Tuesday, Germany made new rules because of the virus. Nightclubs had to close. Sports events could not have people watching.

People could only meet in small groups. If everyone was vaccinated, ten people could meet. If someone was not vaccinated, only two families could meet.

People who are not vaccinated already have rules. They cannot go to shops, restaurants, or shows.

A German leader, Lauterbach, said the rules might need to be stricter. He said the current rules may not stop the virus from spreading. Omicron is a new type of virus.

In Belgium, things changed. The government first closed theatres and cinemas. But a court said they could open again. So, theatres and cinemas are now open in Belgium.

Other countries in Europe are still having problems with the Delta virus.

Poland said that 794 people died from the virus on Wednesday. This is the highest number in the last few months. A health leader in Poland, Waldemar Kraska, said most of the people who died were not vaccinated."
30,30_0,0,"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city.","Ukrainian soldiers are getting closer to taking back Kreminna. Kreminna is a city in the Luhansk area. Russia controls this city now. There is a lot of fighting in the east and south of Ukraine.

Serhiy Haidai is in charge of the Luhansk area. He said that Russian soldiers had to move back. They moved to a town called Rubizhne. Rubizhne is close to Kreminna. The Ukrainian army made them move.

Haidai said that Russia knows it is important to keep Kreminna. If Russia loses Kreminna, it will lose its defense line. Russian soldiers built strong defenses in Kreminna. They have been building it for over a month. They are sending more soldiers and equipment there.

It is hard to know exactly what is happening in the fighting. Taking back Kreminna and Svatove could help Ukraine. Then Ukraine could attack Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these cities in the summer.

The fighting is very bad. There is no sign of peace talks soon. Sergei Lavrov is a Russian leader. He said Ukraine must agree to Russia's demands. He wants Ukraine to become less strong. He also used the word ""denazification."" This means he wants to change the government. If Ukraine does not agree, Russia will defeat them.

Lavrov's words show that Russia still wants to control Ukraine. Russia wants to change the government there. Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to talk about ending the war. But Lavrov's words show this is not true.

The British defense ministry gave an update. They said that Russian soldiers are trying to take Bakhmut. Bakhmut is a city in the Donetsk area. Russian soldiers and Wagner group fighters are trying to capture Bakhmut. They have been trying since July.

Bakhmut is badly damaged from the fighting. The fighting has been going on for almost five months. People call Bakhmut the ""Bakhmut meat-grinder"" because so many soldiers are getting hurt or killed there.

The fight for Bakhmut is important for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He is the leader of the Wagner group. He has hired many Russian prisoners to fight in Bakhmut."
30,30_1,1,"Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory. Since the start of the war, a number of military targets, including oil and weapon depots have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks inside Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as payback.","Here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level:

Prigozhin has said bad things about the Russian army. He thinks his Wagner group fights better in Ukraine.

A video was released on Monday. People think it was filmed near Bakhmut. It shows two men who seem to be Wagner soldiers. They are saying bad things about Valery Gerasimov. He is a top general in the Russian army.

The men are angry. One man says Gerasimov is like a devil. He says they do not have enough weapons or shells to fight.

The Guardian newspaper could not be sure if the video was real. Russian reporters asked Prigozhin about the video. He seemed to agree with what the soldiers did. He said he went to Bakhmut to meet them.

Prigozhin said the soldiers want people to know about the problems at the front. He seemed to be criticizing the army leaders who sit in comfortable offices.

Last Thursday, Ukraine said Russia moved some planes. The planes were at the Engels airfield. Russia said Ukraine attacked the airfield with a drone the day before. Three Russian soldiers died in the attack.

A Ukrainian spokesperson said many planes have been moved to different airfields. Some planes are still at the Engels airfield.

In another place, Russia said they killed four Ukrainian soldiers. The soldiers were on a secret mission in the Bryansk region. This region is in Russia, near the border with Ukraine.

If this is true, it shows that Ukrainian soldiers are doing secret things inside Russia.

Since the war started, some military places in Russia have been damaged. These places include oil and weapon storage areas. They caught fire.

Ukraine does not say they attacked these places. But they are happy when these things happen inside Russia. They think it is like getting revenge."
30,30_2,2,"Also on Tuesday, Putin concluded his two-day “informal summit” in St Petersburg with the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a Moscow-led group consisting of former Soviet states, by gifting the eight leaders present gold rings. The meeting came on the back of growing unease between the Russian president and the rest of the CIS bloc, as nations have sought to distance themselves from Moscow’s faltering war.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a B2 CEFR level:

On Tuesday, Putin finished a meeting in St Petersburg. The meeting lasted two days. It was a meeting with leaders from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The CIS is a group of countries. These countries used to be part of the Soviet Union. Russia leads this group.

Putin gave the eight leaders gold rings as gifts.

Recently, some countries in the CIS have been worried. They are worried about Russia's war. They want to be separate from Russia. They do not want to be connected to the war. This made the meeting tense."
31,31_0,0,"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce.","Many countries in Europe are getting ready to watch for new types of coronavirus. These new types could come from China. Spain and France are now making people get tested at airports again. This is because China is stopping its strict rules about the virus.

On Friday, Spain and France did what Italy did before. They want people coming from China to show a test result that says they do not have the virus. But Spain is different from Italy. Spain does not require tests for people who have proof they are vaccinated.

The health minister of Spain, Carolina Darias, spoke at a meeting. She said she wants to change the rules for the EU's digital Covid certificate. People need this certificate to travel easily.

More people in China are getting sick. Some people do not trust the numbers that China is sharing about the virus. Because of this, some countries are checking people for the virus again. These countries include the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The UK will also start doing this.

Chinese news said that these tests for travelers from China are unfair. They said these tests are done for political reasons. They think other countries are trying to hurt China's plan to open up again.

But in Brussels, Berlin, and Paris, leaders said it is important to be careful. They said it is too soon to be very worried about the virus in China. China has the most people in the world.

The health minister of Germany, Karl Lauterbach, said that mandatory tests for travelers from China are ""not yet necessary."" People can travel to Germany from China through other countries in Europe without showing their passports. This area is called the Schengen area.

Mr. Lauterbach said that the information about the virus that China is giving is not good enough. He said that Germany needs to check for the virus themselves. They can do this by looking at people on airplanes carefully.

The person in charge of health for the European Commission, Stella Kyriakides, spoke on Friday. She asked the 27 countries in the EU to check the virus more carefully. She wants them to study the virus's genes and check the water from airports. This can help find any new types of the virus that might come from China.

Ms. Kyriakides wrote a letter to the health ministers of the EU countries. She said the EU should be ""very careful"" when China stops its travel rules on January 8. She said that it is hard to get good information about the virus and tests in China."
31,31_1,1,"In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, argued that requiring Covid tests for all passengers from China was “only effective if it is taken at the European level”, noting that many people arrive in Italy on connecting flights through other European countries. After an announcement made by Italy’s health ministry on Thursday, travellers from China are obliged to show a negative test result upon embarking on their flight and to take a second antigen test upon their arrival.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR B2 level:

Kyriakides wrote a letter to ministers. Reuters news said she told them to check how they study the coronavirus genes. This should happen quickly.

Earlier in the week, Giorgia Meloni spoke. She is the leader of Italy. She said everyone from China should take a Covid test. But she said this only works if all of Europe does it together. Many people fly to Italy through other European countries.

Italy's health ministry said something on Thursday. People flying from China must now show a negative Covid test before their flight. They must also take another quick test when they arrive in Italy."
32,32_0,0,"Brazil has been gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepared to both welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons. Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration.","Brazil is getting ready for a very important New Year. The country will welcome a new president. They will also say goodbye to a famous person.

Many people will go to Brasilia on January 1. They will see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva become president. He will be president for four years.

The next day, football fans will meet in Santos. They will say goodbye to Pelé. Pelé was a great football player. He died on Thursday.

Pelé's real name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento. He died because his organs stopped working. He had colon cancer for over a year. He was 82 years old. He used to play for Santos and New York Cosmos. He was in the hospital for over a month.

Walter Dias is a journalist. He is 87 years old. He wrote about Santos when they were very good in the 1960s. He was friends with Pelé and his family. He said that the city is sad. Everyone feels bad because Pelé was important in their lives. He made them happy. It is like losing a family member.

Usually, funerals in Brazil happen quickly. But Pelé's family asked for more time. They want all family members to come and say goodbye. It will be a sad goodbye.

Pelé was married three times. He had seven children and many grandchildren. Some live in the United States. Others live in different parts of Brazil. Brazil is a big country, almost as big as Europe.

Many people will come to the city of Santos. About 2 million people live there. Many news reporters from all over the world will also be there.

The current president is Jair Bolsonaro. He is named after a football player, Jair da Rosa Pinto. He will not go to the funeral. He will fly to Florida. He will not give the president's symbol to the new president.

On Friday, Bolsonaro spoke for the last time as president. He said bad things about Lula's new team. He also talked about a supporter of his. This supporter tried to blow up a truck with fuel. This happened before the new president starts."
32,32_1,1,"That terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia, and the weekend is set to be both tense and festive – but whatever happens could be overshadowed by the following day’s events. Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides.","There is a worry about terrorists in Brasilia. This makes the city feel unsafe. The weekend will be exciting, but also stressful. Something else might become more important than the weekend.

Lula will become president soon. People from many countries will come to his celebration. But Pelé died. This is big news all over the world. People are getting ready to say goodbye to him. It will be like a funeral for a very important person.

Presidents and other leaders sent messages. Sports stars and old teammates sent messages too. They all said they were sorry about Pelé's death. This happened on Thursday. Bolsonaro said the country will be sad for three days.

Lula will be the new president. He said Pelé made Brazil famous. People all over the world could say his name, even if they spoke a different language. They knew the name ""Pelé"".

The president of Santos said Pelé will always be remembered. Santos is the soccer club where Pelé became famous. Andres Rueda said Pelé did not die. He will live forever in people's hearts. Pelé came to Santos as a young boy. He left as a king. People loved him in Santos, in Brazil, and all over the world. Andres Rueda told Edson (Pelé's real name) to rest in peace. He asked Pelé to watch over them.

Pelé's body is in a hospital in São Paulo. It will stay there until Monday morning. Then, it will be taken to the Santos soccer stadium. This is about 50 miles away. The coffin will be placed on the soccer field. People can come to the stadium to say goodbye to Pelé.

His body will stay there for one day. Then, on Tuesday morning, his family will have a private funeral. After the funeral, the cars with the body will drive through the city. They will go past the house where Pelé's mother lives. She is 100 years old."
32,32_2,2,"The former athlete of the century will be laid to rest at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies that claims to be the tallest in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a space on the ninth floor of the building almost two decades ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out. Pelé is loved by people here and by fans of the club because he projected the name of Santos all over the world.”","The famous football player, Pelé, has died. He will be buried in a special place. This place is called the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica. It is a very tall building where people are buried.

This building has space for many people. It says it is the tallest cemetery in the world.

Pelé chose this place a long time ago. He wanted to be buried on the ninth floor. He paid for this space. This was almost twenty years ago.

His father was also a football player. His father wore the number nine shirt. That is why Pelé wanted to be on the ninth floor.

From this place, you can see the Vila Belmiro stadium. Pelé chose this place because it made him feel calm. He said it felt peaceful there. He also said it did not look like a normal cemetery.

Someone named Dias talked about the event. He thinks many people will come. The city is getting ready. People will come to remember Pelé.

People in the city love Pelé. Fans of his football club love him too. He made the city of Santos famous all over the world."
33,33_0,0,"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","In 2022, many countries had problems with Covid and a war in Ukraine. But China seemed peaceful at the start.

China's leader, Xi Jinping, had a plan called ""zero-Covid."" It kept the number of Covid cases low.

Sometimes, cities were locked down. But people followed the rules.

Xi probably wanted this calm situation as he took power for a third time. This was a big event in China.

He had big goals for China. He wanted the economy to be strong. He wanted to control the country. He also wanted to take over Taiwan and have more power in the world.

But as 2022 ends and 2023 starts, China is facing new and difficult problems.

In the past year, there have been problems with houses and the economy. There was also tension with Taiwan in August.

Other countries put rules on China because of human rights issues. The US also made rules about China's chip industry. China's friendship with Russia is also causing problems.

Xi did get his third term as leader. But then, people started protesting. They were very brave. These protests seemed to end the ""zero-Covid"" plan suddenly.

Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a good year for Xi. But now, he has many worries.

Jerome Cohen, a China expert, said that China is in trouble. He thinks Xi has lost respect from many people.

In October, there was a meeting called the 20th Party Congress. At this meeting, Xi got a third term. This made him the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

Before Xi, leaders had rules to stop one person from having too much power. But Xi changed that.

He made his own ideas, called ""Xi Jinping thought,"" the most important ideas of the party. He also got rid of people who disagreed with him. One example was when the former president, Hu Jintao, was taken out of the meeting hall.

Now Xi has a lot of power. Some people worry about what he will do. They think he might make bad decisions because he is surrounded by people who always agree with him.

Professor Steve Tsang said that Xi getting a third term is the most important thing that happened in China in 2022."
33,33_1,1,"“Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn.","Xi Jinping has a plan for China. He calls it ""Xi Jinping Thought."" But some people think his plan is taking China in a new and risky direction.

One of Xi's biggest plans is to take over Taiwan. Taiwan is an island that governs itself. Some experts do not think China will attack Taiwan soon.

Last year, China's military did more near Taiwan than ever before. In August, China said it might use force to take Taiwan.

Nancy Pelosi, a leader from the United States, visited Taiwan. This made China angry. China showed its power by sending more military planes and ships near Taiwan.

The United States is important for Taiwan. The US is giving more support to Taiwan. They might call Taiwan a ""non-major Nato ally."" The US is also selling weapons to Taiwan.

Ma Chun-Wei is a professor in Taiwan. He says China cannot fight the US. So, China is showing its anger towards Taiwan and its people.

China might use tricks to influence Taiwan before its next election in 2024. They might use fake news online or pressure Taiwan's economy.

Yun Sun is an expert on China. She says China will put more pressure on Taiwan. This will happen as long as the Democratic Progressive party is in power in Taiwan. This party wants Taiwan to be independent.

On Monday, Taiwan said that many Chinese planes flew near the island. There were 71 planes, including fighter jets. This was the most planes ever reported at one time.

China's actions towards Taiwan have made Xi's relationship with the West worse.

China's actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang have also caused problems. China is treating people unfairly in these places. The United Nations says China's actions in Xinjiang might be crimes against humanity.

Russia attacked Ukraine. This also made things worse. Xi and Vladimir Putin, the leader of Russia, said they were good friends. But China did not say that Russia's attack was wrong."
33,33_2,2,"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”. Zero-Covid restrictions and the near collapse of the property development sector punished China’s economy this year.","The war in Ukraine has made things hard for Xi Jinping. He is the leader of China. The war has created problems for him in the world.

Xi wants to stay friends with Putin, the leader of Russia. But he does not want to be punished with rules against Russia. China and Russia also compete for power in Asia. They both want to control trade in that area.

America said that Putin asked China for weapons. China did not give weapons to Russia. But China has helped Russia in other ways. They seem to work together to spread news. China also tries to stop rules against Russia.

Chinese leaders have said they agree with Russia's actions in Ukraine. The armies of China and Russia have practiced fighting together.

Chinese diplomats have also caused problems for Xi. A Chinese diplomat in England hurt a person who was protesting for democracy in Hong Kong. This made China's relationship with other countries worse.

But Xi still cares about global relationships. After he became leader for the third time, he talked to many leaders. He spoke with Joe Biden, the leader of America.

A person named Cohen says Xi is trying to make China look better. China has been acting too strong and causing problems.

Xi is trying to be friendly. But people are watching to see what he does. They have been worried about human rights in China.

Maya Wang from Human Rights Watch says some countries might become nicer to China. They might stop worrying about human rights.

For now, countries are still being tough on China. America is making rules against China's computer chip industry. Japan and the Netherlands will probably do the same. This will cause problems for China's economy. Xi wants to make the economy better.

Tsang says these rules might hurt China's economy more than Covid did.

China's economy was bad this year. This was because of Covid rules and problems with houses being built."
33,33_3,3,"To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone. A faltering economy could further provoke domestic frustrations, which peaked in 2022 over the impact of Xi’s signature hardline zero-Covid policy. For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled. With no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel restrictions or mass testing, Covid cases have soared across China. Mass fatalities are predicted, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus.","The Chinese government wants to fix the problem of buildings falling apart. They will give 1.4 trillion yuan to start building again. This money will help companies build more things. Experts think this will help China's economy grow.

But the government still has problems. The ""zero-COVID"" policy hurt the economy. Now, the policy is gone, but more people are getting sick. A weak economy could make people angry.

In 2022, people were very upset about the ""zero-COVID"" policy. For two years, this policy helped most people live normally. It also kept the number of deaths low. But then, a new kind of COVID, called Omicron, spread quickly. This made the economy and people's lives difficult.

People did not like the sudden and badly managed lockdowns. There were some small protests. These protests became bigger after some sad accidents. One accident was a bus crash. Another was a fire in a building where people were locked down.

These protests were the biggest in China since 1989. People were mostly angry about the ""zero-COVID"" rules. They also complained about censorship. Some people even said they did not like the leader, Xi.

The protests made some people think about how the government treats minorities and people who disagree with them. One expert said that the COVID problems showed people that the government does not always follow its own rules, even though it says it wants to have ""rule by law.""

The government quickly used the police to stop the protests. But the protests seemed to work. After one week, the ""zero-COVID"" policy suddenly ended. Many people thought this policy would last much longer.

Now, there are no more lockdowns or travel rules. People do not have to get tested all the time. But COVID cases are increasing a lot. Experts think many people will die from the virus, maybe even one million."
33,33_4,4,"On Monday, in his first remarks on Covid since the shift in policy, Xi urged officials to take steps to “feasibly protect people’s lives” and said: “We should launch the patriotic health campaign in a more targeted way ... fortify a community line of defence for epidemic prevention and control, and feasibly protect people’s lives, safety and health.” Trivium says what happens next with Covid and Covid policy is “the most important question” politically and economically, for China and Xi in 2023: “It’s not at all clear how this plays out.” The past year has brought far more for China than Xi would have hoped, or analysts expected. Tsang says that, in the end, events have still largely worked out for Xi, even if protests took the shine off his leadership. “He mostly got what he wanted, including not just a third term as top leader but also a leadership filled by his supporters,” says Tsang. “It is less clear that it was equally good for China, as Xi’s amassing of near dictatorial power is costing China dearly.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin","On Monday, Xi spoke about Covid. This was his first time talking about it since the rules changed. He told leaders to help people stay alive. He said they should start a health program that focuses on what people need. This program will help stop the virus in communities. It will protect people's lives, safety, and health.

Trivium says the next steps with Covid are very important. This is important for China and Xi in 2023. It is important for politics and the economy. It is hard to know what will happen.

The last year was not what Xi wanted. It was also not what experts thought would happen.

Tsang says things have still been good for Xi. Even though there were protests, he still got what he wanted. He got a third term as leader. He also has leaders who support him.

Tsang also says this might not be good for China. Xi has a lot of power, like a dictator. This is costing China a lot.

Chi Hui Lin helped with this report."
34,34_0,0,"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","China is getting ready for more COVID-19 cases. This could happen in the countryside in early 2023.

Right now, many cities have a lot of people sick. Hospitals and special care units are very full.

The Chinese New Year is in late January. It is a very important holiday. People can see their families after a long time. They could not travel easily before because of COVID-19 rules.

But many people will travel home for the holiday. They might bring the virus with them. These people will go to areas that do not have many hospitals or doctors. They also have less medicine and equipment. People there may not have enough money for medical care.

One person wrote on a Chinese social media site. They said that everyone should have the same chance to fight the virus. But cities and rural areas are not equal. The person said that rural areas have fewer resources. They also do not know as much about how to handle health problems.

A British company called Airfinity said the next wave of infections will likely happen in rural areas in late winter. It could affect even more people than the current wave in cities.

The government has changed how it talks about COVID-19. Before, they said it was very dangerous. Now, they say it is like a cold.

The person on the social media site said their hometown is talking differently about getting sick. They say that everyone has a cold, so people should not be scared.

Because of this, the government is not telling people to do things like stay away from each other. This could slow down the spread of the virus. It could also give hospitals more time to help people.

Jeremy Wallace is a professor at Cornell University. He said he is surprised that the government is not talking about how many people are suffering. He also said that the government is not telling people how to slow down the spread of the virus. This could help the hospitals that have too many patients."
34,34_1,1,"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","I think many people will die. Models looked at Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. They show that maybe 1 million people will die.

In cities, COVID is spreading very fast. Experts think the infections might soon be at their highest point. But it is hard to know what is happening. China stopped controlling the disease as much. They also stopped sharing COVID numbers.

China used to be proud of its COVID numbers. Now, many people are sick and dying. The National Health Commission (NHC) said they will not share the daily death numbers anymore.

AFP news said that on Friday, the NHC said only one person died from COVID. They said there were 5,500 new cases in one day. But we see many pictures and stories of hospitals with too many patients.

Airfinity thinks that about 9,000 people are dying each day from COVID in China. They think this number could go up to 25,000 each day next month. By April, they think 1.7 million people could die.

Jiao Yahui is a spokesperson for the NHC. She said that China is not counting all deaths as COVID deaths. Other countries count deaths differently. AFP reported this.

In other countries, if someone dies within 28 days of testing positive for COVID, it is counted as a COVID death. But China only counts deaths caused by breathing problems from the virus.

Jiao said that China follows scientific rules for counting COVID deaths. She said these rules are like the rules used by other countries.

China says they are handling the pandemic well. They went from strict rules to letting the disease spread. But social media shows a sad reality.

Usually, China quickly stops people from criticizing the government online. But now, many posts about the real situation with COVID in China are online. These posts are staying online for a while. Charlie Smith from Greatfire.org said this. Greatfire.org watches what is censored online.

He said the rules about what is allowed online are changing fast. The people who censor the internet cannot keep up. That is why many posts are still online."
34,34_2,2,"But it also makes sense that the real humans who are behind censorship can see for themselves that current Covid management is all over the place,” he said. “They must be asking themselves how they could possibly censor Covid-related posts when everyone has Covid.”",He also said something important. The people who decide what to censor are also human. They can see what is happening with the virus. The rules about Covid are confusing. Maybe they are thinking about this. They might be wondering how to stop Covid posts. Everyone is getting Covid now.
35,35_0,0,"Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year amid mounting military tensions with China, the island’s president has announced. Under the plans due to come into effect in 2024, conscripts will undergo more intense training, including shooting exercises and combat instruction used by US forces. Conscripts will be tasked with guarding key infrastructure, enabling regular forces to respond more swiftly in the event of any attempt by China to invade. The announcement of the change came after Taiwan’s defence ministry reported that 71 Chinese air force jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone within 24 hours on Monday – the largest reported incursion to date. “As long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,” President Tsai Ing-wen told a news conference after a national security council meeting. “Taiwan wants to tell the world that between democracy and dictatorship, we firmly believe in democracy. Between war and peace, we insist on peace. Let us show the courage and determination to protect our homeland and defend democracy.” The defence authority also plans to raise the monthly wage of regular conscription soldiers from about NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), almost in line with the minimum wage. Since 2013, Taiwan has required men over 18 to serve four months in the military, with the first five weeks in a basic training boot camp. The new plan will put mandatory recruits on eight-week basic training. Chen Chi-mai, mayor of Kaohsiung city and the acting chairperson of the ruling Democratic Progressive party, told reporters on Tuesday that it was essential to strengthen national security, the official news agency CNA reported. Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China’s growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence. Tsai said “a few things” had been learned from that war which have been incorporated into Taiwan’s defence reforms, and noted that Ukraine’s ability to hold off much larger Russian forces had given the international community time to render assistance.","Taiwan will make its military service longer. Now, young men must serve for four months. Soon, they will need to serve for one year.

This change is because of problems with China. China and Taiwan have disagreements. The leader of Taiwan announced this new plan. It will start in 2024.

The soldiers will have harder training. They will learn to shoot better. They will learn fighting skills from the United States military.

The soldiers will guard important places. This will help the main army respond quickly if China tries to attack.

Recently, many Chinese planes flew near Taiwan. The defense ministry said 71 planes and drones came close. This was the most ever in one day.

The leader of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, spoke to the news. She said Taiwan must be strong. She said Taiwan is a place for freedom and democracy. It will not become a war zone.

She also said Taiwan chooses democracy over dictatorship. It wants peace, not war. She wants people to protect their home and democracy.

The government will pay soldiers more. Now, they get about $211 each month. Soon, they will get about $856. This is close to the lowest wage a person can earn.

Now, soldiers train for five weeks when they start. With the new plan, they will train for eight weeks.

A mayor named Chen Chi-mai said it is important to make the country safer.

Taiwan used to make many people join the army. Now, it wants more volunteers. But China is becoming stronger. China says Taiwan is part of China. Also, Russia attacked Ukraine. These things made Taiwan think about how to protect itself better.

Tsai said Taiwan learned from the war in Ukraine. These lessons are now part of Taiwan's plans to protect itself. Ukraine fought against Russia, which is a much bigger country. This gave other countries time to help Ukraine."
35,35_1,1,"Previous governments cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to four months to please younger voters during a period of easing tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan’s efforts to bolster the readiness of its defence forces accelerated after the visit to the island from the US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August. China immediately staged military drills around Taiwan in response to Pelosi’s visit. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan welcomed the announcement on conscription reform. “The United States’ commitment to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defence capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,” the American Institute in Taiwan said. A survey conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December found that 73.2% of respondents were in favour of an extension to compulsory service. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the Chinese military threat was “getting more serious than ever”, with a five-fold increase in warplane incursions into the island’s defence zone since 2020. Wu said the drills conducted after Pelosi’s visit were also aimed at scaring off other governments which might support Taiwan. As part of the efforts to ramp up the island’s combat strength, on Friday Tsai inaugurated new military facilities at an army base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, which she said offers “a better living environment” for military personnel, according to a statement released by the president office. Reuters contributed to this report","Here's a rewritten version of the text, suitable for a B2 level English speaker:

In the past, Taiwan had leaders who changed the rules about military service. They made the time shorter for young men. They wanted young people to like them. At that time, Taiwan and China were not fighting much. The service was more than two years, but it became only four months.

Things changed after a visit to Taiwan. Nancy Pelosi, a leader from the United States, went to Taiwan in August. After that, Taiwan started to work harder to be ready to defend itself.

China was not happy about Pelosi's visit. China showed its power by doing military training near Taiwan.

The American Institute in Taiwan is like the US embassy. They were happy about Taiwan's plan to change the military service. They said it helps keep peace. They think Taiwan's ability to defend itself makes the area safer.

A study asked people in Taiwan what they thought. Most people, about 73%, said they wanted the military service to be longer.

Joseph Wu is Taiwan's foreign minister. He said that China is becoming a bigger threat. He said China's military planes are flying into Taiwan's defense area much more often than before. It is five times more than in 2020. Wu believes that China's training exercises after Pelosi's visit were also meant to scare other countries that might help Taiwan.

Taiwan wants to be stronger in case of a fight. Tsai, the leader of Taiwan, opened new buildings at a military base. The base is in Kaohsiung, a city in the south. She said the new buildings will give the soldiers a better place to live. This information came from a statement from the president's office. Reuters helped write this news report."
36,36_0,0,"Kherson city was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November. But for some, the horrors of the Russian occupation are still not over. Nadia* sent her 14-year-old son to a Russian-run summer camp in Crimea – occupied by Moscow since 2014 – in October. He was meant to return after two weeks. It has now been more than two months. In late November, he forwarded her a series of chilling voice messages from his camp leader telling him he would not be allowed back to Kherson because of his pro-Ukraine views. “You are in Russia! You shouldn’t be doing different [types] of weird bullshit,” the camp leader in Yevpatoria, Crimea, said in the voice messages, which have been forwarded to the Guardian. “I don’t know who is going to deal with you now, but you are not going back to Kherson, that’s 100% [certain] … You can thank your mother for that.” Like many parents, Nadia did not see sending her child to such a camp – known as summer camps even at other times of year – as making a pro-Russia statement. Parents often decided to send their children because their classmates were going and they were being offered a free holiday by the sea. Nadia’s son left Kherson on 4 October and his stay at the camp was repeatedly extended by the authorities, said his mother, speaking from central Kherson after Russian forces left the city. At first, the camp leaders told her that this was for safety reasons and then, after Ukrainian forces had entered Kherson city, they said he could not return because the city was now “occupied” by Ukraine. In the messages, the camp leader outlined his problem with the boy. Firstly, his Telegram profile picture featured a Ukrainian trident, Ukraine’s national symbol, on the wall in the background. Secondly, his mother had said she wanted her son to return to Ukraine, signifying that she saw Kherson city as part of Ukraine, not Russia, thereby going against the grain of Russian propaganda that still insists the city is part of Russia. Nadia’s case is one of many. Hundreds of Ukrainian children as young as six and as old as 16 from Kherson and Kharkiv regions have been stuck in Russian summer camps for weeks and in some cases months.","Kherson is a city in Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers freed it from Russian control in November. But some people in Kherson still have problems from when Russia controlled the city.

Nadia* is a mother. She sent her 14-year-old son to a camp in Crimea in October. Crimea has been controlled by Russia since 2014. The camp was run by Russians. The camp was supposed to be for two weeks. But now it has been more than two months.

In November, Nadia got voice messages from the camp leader. The camp leader said her son could not go back to Kherson. The leader said this was because her son supported Ukraine.

The camp leader was in Yevpatoria, Crimea. He said in the messages: ""You are in Russia! You should not do strange things."" He also said: ""I don't know who will deal with you now. But you are not going back to Kherson. This is sure. You can blame your mother for this."" Nadia sent these messages to a newspaper called The Guardian.

Many parents did not think sending their children to the camp was supporting Russia. The camps were called summer camps. Parents sent their children because other children were going. The camp was a free trip to the sea.

Nadia's son left Kherson on October 4. The camp leaders kept him there longer and longer. At first, they said it was for safety. Then, Ukrainian soldiers freed Kherson. The camp leaders said he could not return because Ukraine was now controlling the city.

The camp leader said he had problems with the boy. First, the boy's picture on Telegram showed a Ukrainian symbol. It was a trident on the wall. The trident is a symbol of Ukraine. Second, Nadia said she wanted her son to return to Ukraine. This meant she thought Kherson was part of Ukraine, not Russia. This was against what Russia was saying. Russia was saying Kherson was part of Russia.

Nadia's story is not the only one. Many Ukrainian children are stuck in Russian summer camps. They are from Kherson and Kharkiv. Some children are only six years old. Some are sixteen. They have been in the camps for weeks or months."
36,36_1,1,"Over the summer, Russia offered parents in the occupied areas of Ukraine a chance to send their children to summer camps in Crimea and southern Russia for free. But it has been refusing to return the children to their parents, citing the ongoing fighting as well as Ukraine’s “occupation” of areas Russia claimed to have annexed and has now retreated from. Parents are told they can collect the children if they come in person, which requires them to cross the dangerous unofficial checkpoint through the frontline or leave Ukraine and travel via Poland and the Baltics. But many of the parents are from very low-income backgrounds and have not been able to make the journey. Though the parents sent them willingly, they had agreed to a short stint. The UN convention on children’s rights bans the “illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad”, so Russia is obliged to return the children. The Guardian spoke to eight parents who had sent their children to the summer camps. Some say they believe that Russia wants to use the children to exchange for Russian prisoners of war. Others believe Moscow wants to assimilate the children and plan to keep them in Russia. The camps were advertised through schools in the occupied areas as restorative breaks, offering a mix of sports, arts, games, and sea air or lake swimming. But the children have also been taught Russian narratives about the invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Soviet history as well as Russian culture, according to several interviewed and videos posted online. In one video, hundreds of children can be seen in a school playground in Crimea singing the Russian national anthem. Most appear not to know the words. The hundreds of children stuck in the Russian-run summer camps are in addition to the thousands of children living in orphanages in the occupied areas who were illegally taken to Russia during the Russian occupation. Ukraine’s human right’s ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, has said this is part of Russia’s “genocide against Ukraine”, erasing Ukrainian identity through “re-educating the future generations”. Lubinets said the Russians were not interested in returning the children, and though Ukraine was trying, “the return of each child is like a special operation”. Ukraine asks parents not to publicly name their children as they then become harder to exchange.","In the summer, Russia had a program for children from Ukraine. These children lived in areas taken over by Russia. Russia offered their parents free summer camps for them. The camps were in Crimea and southern Russia.

But now, Russia is not sending the children back home. They say it is because of the fighting. They also say that Ukraine is occupying some areas that Russia used to control.

Parents can get their children back. But they must go to Russia themselves. This is very hard. They must cross a dangerous checkpoint. Or, they must leave Ukraine and travel through Poland and other countries.

Many parents do not have enough money for this trip. They are poor. They cannot afford to go to Russia.

The parents agreed to send their children for a short time. But now, Russia is keeping them longer.

There is an international rule about children. It says that countries cannot take children to another country and not return them. Russia should send the children back.

The Guardian newspaper talked to eight parents. They sent their children to the summer camps. Some parents think Russia wants to trade the children. They think Russia will exchange them for Russian soldiers who are prisoners.

Other parents think Russia wants to keep the children. They think Russia wants the children to become Russian.

The camps were advertised in schools. They were said to be good for the children. They offered sports, art, games, and swimming.

But the children are also learning about Russia. They are learning Russian stories about the war. They are learning about Russian history and culture.

One video shows many children in Crimea. They are singing the Russian national anthem. Most of them do not know the words.

There are also many children in orphanages. These children were taken to Russia illegally. They were taken when Russia controlled their areas.

Dmytro Lubinets is from Ukraine. He works to protect people's rights. He says Russia is doing something very bad. He says Russia is trying to destroy Ukrainian identity. They are doing this by teaching the children to be Russian.

Lubinets says Russia does not want to return the children. Ukraine is trying to get them back. But it is very difficult. Getting each child back is like a special mission.

Ukraine asks parents not to say their children's names publicly. This makes it harder to get them back from Russia."
36,36_2,2,"For a domestic audience, Russia portrays the deportation of the children as an attempt to save Ukrainian children from the war – ignoring Russia’s role in starting the conflict. Since October, the children have started attending Russian schools while living on the camps’ premises. It is not clear what plans Russia has for these children beyond this school term. One of them is Natalia’s* 12-year-old daughter, who left her home in Balakliia in late August and is still in southern Russia, attending a school in Krasnodar by bus. Natalia has managed to keep in daily contact with her but cannot afford to make the journey to collect her. “I think it’s some sort of blackmail,” said Natalia. “I think they want to use them as bargaining chips.” In at least some cases, the Russian camp leaders have said they do not plan to send the children back. In other cases, children have been moved from one camp to another without the parents being informed. Ivana*, a mother from Kherson region, made the long journey to collect her daughter from a camp in Crimea, only to be told the child was not there any more and had been moved to a camp in the Republic of Adygea. She then made a second long trip, where eventually she found her. * * * Exactly how many Ukrainian children remain in Russian hands is very difficult to tell. In mid-October, Russia’s state news agency Tass said there were about 4,500 children from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Crimean summer camps. Natalia said at least 100 of those who travelled with her daughter were still there. Recent videos taken from some of the five camps in Crimea hosting children from Kherson indicate that at least several hundred children are still there. Part of the issue is that many of the parents refuse to come forward to the Ukrainian authorities. Dmytro*, who managed to get his son back by threatening a teacher into putting him on a bus in early October, said parents he knew feared being labelled as collaborators or supporters of Russia. They were trying to resolve things on their own, he said, without official help.","Russia says they took Ukrainian children to help them. They say they wanted to save the children from the war. But Russia started the war.

The children now live in camps in Russia. Since October, they go to Russian schools. We do not know what Russia will do with them after school.

Natalia's daughter is twelve years old. She left her home in Ukraine in August. Now, she is in Russia, in a school in Krasnodar. She goes to school by bus.

Natalia talks to her daughter every day. But Natalia cannot go to Russia to get her daughter. Natalia thinks Russia is using the children. She thinks Russia wants to use them to get something they want.

Some camp leaders in Russia say they will not send the children back to Ukraine. Sometimes, the children are moved to other camps. The parents do not know about it.

Ivana is a mother from Ukraine. She went to Crimea to get her daughter from a camp. But her daughter was not there. Her daughter was moved to another camp. Ivana went to the other camp and found her daughter.

It is hard to know how many Ukrainian children are in Russia. In October, Russia said there were 4,500 children in camps in Crimea. These children were from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Natalia knows that at least 100 children who went with her daughter are still in the camps.

There are videos of children in camps in Crimea. These videos show that many children are still there.

Some parents do not want to talk to the Ukrainian government. They are afraid people will think they support Russia. They want to get their children back without help.

Dmytro got his son back. He told a teacher to put his son on a bus. He said other parents are afraid. They do not want problems with the government."
36,36_3,3,"An adviser to the new Kherson regional authorities on missing people, Volodymyr Zhdanov, questioned how the parents “could give their children to the occupiers”, though he admitted it was a grey area and the full picture was unclear. “We are hearing a lot of stories through the grapevine [of children stuck in Crimea],” said Zhdanov, who noted that the gathering of information on what had happened in occupied Kherson was only just beginning. “But the police say parents have not come forward.” Andrii Kovanyi, a spokesperson for Kherson police, said they could not comment on the matter as it was being dealt with by several bodies. Most parents and children who attended the camps said the conditions were good. Children were given the equivalent of hotel rooms to share, taken to see dolphins, to museums and to the beach. The Russian-appointed authorities in Crimea claim to have spent 1.2bn rubles (£16.4m) in 2022 on the camps, which were also attended by Russian children. The idea behind the camps appears to be to demonstrate the best of Russia and to integrate the children into their new state. In interviews, the adults in charge portray themselves and others as saving children who are victims of the war as well as the Ukrainian state. In videos from the children’s camps posted on the Russian-installed Kherson authority’s social media, children can be seen with the Russian flag, singing the Russian national anthem as well as classic Soviet songs. A nine-year-old girl in Kherson city, whose mother collected her in October, said that as well as games and sports they had lectures “about the war”. One history teacher from Kherson, Maksym Ivchenko, who like many other teachers accompanied the children to Crimea, was asked by Russia’s Crimea24 TV to explain how the history curriculum in Russia differed from that of Ukraine. “The most egregious thing was the reversal of modern history. We’re talking first of all about the great patriotic war [the second world war], what happened in the Soviet period, its collapse and everything up until the present day,” Ivchenko said.","Volodymyr Zhdanov works for the new leaders in Kherson. He helps find people who are missing. He asked why parents sent their kids to the other side. He said it is hard to understand. We do not know everything yet.

Zhdanov said that he heard stories about children in Crimea. Crimea is a place controlled by Russia. He said they are just starting to find out what happened in Kherson. Kherson was also controlled by Russia. Zhdanov said the police say parents have not reported missing children.

Andrii Kovanyi speaks for the Kherson police. He said he cannot talk about this. Many groups are working on this problem.

Most parents and kids who went to the camps said they were good. The kids stayed in rooms like in a hotel. They saw dolphins and museums. They went to the beach.

The Russian leaders in Crimea said they spent a lot of money on the camps. Russian children also went to these camps. They wanted to show the children the good things about Russia. They wanted the children to feel like they belonged in Russia.

The adults in charge said they are helping children. They said the children are victims of the war and the Ukrainian government.

Videos from the camps show children with the Russian flag. They sing Russian songs. They also sing old Soviet songs.

One girl from Kherson went to the camp. Her mother brought her home in October. The girl said they played games and sports. They also had lessons about the war. She was nine years old.

Maksym Ivchenko is a history teacher from Kherson. He went to Crimea with the children. Russia's Crimea24 TV asked him about history. They asked how Russian history lessons are different from Ukrainian history lessons.

Ivchenko said the biggest difference was about recent history. He said they changed the story of World War II. They also changed the story of the Soviet Union. He said they changed everything up to now."
36,36_4,4,"Tatiana Makarova, the head of the programme for Kherson and Zaporizhzhia at one the biggest camps in Crimea, Artek, told the same TV channel: “Our task is to remove the psychological pressure put on the children who come from the areas where the war is happening.” Nadia said she and her son had argued at first because she did not want him to go to the camp, but eventually she gave in. “I thought: OK, it’s two weeks, there’s the seaside, he’ll get a rest and come back.” * Names have been changed","Tatiana Makarova works at Artek. Artek is a very big camp in Crimea. She is in charge of the program for children from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. She spoke on TV. She said their job is to help the children. The children are stressed. They come from places where there is war.

Nadia sent her son to the camp. At first, she did not want to. She and her son argued about it. But then she changed her mind. She thought it was only for two weeks. The camp is by the sea. She hoped her son would rest. She wanted him to come back feeling better.

* The names used are not real names. They were changed to protect people."

Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war.

President Zelenskyy said that everywhere in Bakhmut is covered in blood. Ukrainian soldiers are fighting hard in Bakhmut. The fighting there shows how terrible the war is.

President Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine has freed 1,456 soldiers who were prisoners. Russia took them as prisoners after the war started in February.

President Zelenskyy spoke to the Ukrainian parliament. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi was there. He is the head of the Ukrainian army. Government workers, diplomats from other countries, soldiers, and families of soldiers who died were also there.

The Russian government said that any plan to end the war must accept that Russia now controls four areas of Ukraine. Russia says these areas are now part of Russia. Other countries do not agree.

Dmitry Peskov speaks for the Russian government. He said that he does not agree with President Zelenskyy's peace plan. Zelenskyy wants Russia to leave Ukraine, free all prisoners, and pay for the damage it has caused.

With his dog, Zhu-Zhu, the former ship’s cook banked on being ignored by the trigger-happy Russian soldiers and their killing machines when he took the first step of a 140-mile journey from his home in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on 23 April, before stealing out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories towards the relative safety in the city of Zaporizhzhia.

**Hospital Strike**

The attack damaged a hospital. Windows broke. Staff and patients went to the basement to hide.

One staff member said she was scared. Surgeons were working in the hospital just before the attack.

**Igor Pedin's Journey**

Igor Pedin is 61 years old. He survived because he thought he was not seen. He left his home with his dog, Zhu-Zhu. He used to cook on ships.

His home was in Mariupol. The city was under attack. He hoped the Russian soldiers would not see him. He planned to walk 140 miles.

He left on April 23rd. He walked through areas controlled by Russia. He wanted to get to Zaporizhzhia. It was safer there.

It was very dangerous. Soldiers stopped him at a checkpoint. They asked him to go back. Then, they gave him cigarettes for luck.

He did survive. It was very hard. Now, his story is known. Many people know about him. He is famous now.

**Evacuation of Kherson**

Ukrainian leaders want people to leave Kherson. Russian soldiers are attacking the city. They are using mortars and artillery.

Kherson was recently freed from Russian control. Some people lived through the Russian occupation. They do not want to leave, even with the attacks.

Dmytro Poddubniy is a member of the Kherson city council. He said Kherson is very dangerous now.

He tells people to think of leaving as a vacation. He hopes this will help them decide to go. But many people are staying.

Inna Balyoha lives in Kherson. She said she is afraid for her mother. Her mother is old and sick. She might not survive the trip.

Inna said her mother is weak. She might not reach another city. Many people stay in Kherson to care for their parents.

Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. The Crimean human rights activist, nurse and citizen journalist was detained by Russian authorities in late April while on her way from work. Her family told CNN at the time balaclava-clad officials from the Russian special police unit searched her house in the village of Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya, and took the family’s laptops and phones. Her case was part of a string of disappearances of activists, journalists and ordinary citizens reported over the last decade in Russian-occupied Crimea. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) called on Russian authorities in Crimea to disclose any information concerning Danilovich’s whereabouts when she first went missing. In a statement, Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator, said: Iryna Danilovich’s alarming disappearance prompts fears of yet another clampdown on independent reporting in Russian-occupied Crimea, which is already an extremely restrictive environment for the press. Russia’s security service (FSB) accused Danilovich of making an explosive device and keeping it on her person, IMI said. She was also fined 50,000 rubles (£570) on the charges of illegal storage and manufacture of explosives under Part 1 of Art. 222.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, it said.

The human rights worker's name is Iryna Danilovich. She will be sent to a prison in Crimea. Russia took Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. This information comes from a group called the Institute of Mass Information (IMI). They are based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Iryna is a human rights worker, a nurse, and a journalist. Russian police took her in April. She was going home from work.

Her family spoke to CNN. They said that police searched her house. The police wore masks. They took computers and phones from the house.

Many activists, journalists, and people in Crimea have disappeared in recent years. Russia controls Crimea.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) asked Russia for information about Iryna. They were worried when she disappeared.

Gulnoza Said works for CJP. She said she is worried about free news in Crimea. It is already hard for journalists to work there.

Russia says Iryna made an explosive. They say she had it with her. She also has to pay 50,000 rubles (about £570). Russia says she broke the law about explosives.

The defence ministers of Russia, Turkey and Syria held talks in Moscow today, Russian state media reported. State-owned news agency Ria cited Russia’s defence ministry as saying: Ways of resolving the Syrian crisis and the problem of refugees as well as joint efforts to combat extremist groups in Syria have been discussed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a post on Telegram, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Zelenskiy said: Last year, 70,000 people lived there. Now only a few civilians are left there. There is no place that is not covered with blood. There is no hour when the terrible roar of artillery does not sound.","Experts who study populations have given a warning. They say that Russia's war in Ukraine could make Russia's population problems worse. This is because Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, has called up some people to fight in the war.

An Australian woman's son died fighting in Ukraine. She said he was a kind person who wanted to protect freedom. The Australian government has said that the man, Sage O'Donnell, was from Melbourne. He died in Ukraine.

The United Nations has been counting the number of people killed in the war. They say that they know of 6,884 people who have died in Ukraine. This includes 429 children. These deaths happened between February 24, 2022, and December 26, 2022. The United Nations thinks the real number of deaths is probably much higher.

Vladimir Putin has signed a new law. This law says that Russia will not sell oil to countries that have set a price limit on Russian oil. This law will start on February 1, 2023, and last for five months.

Several powerful countries and groups have agreed on a price limit for Russian oil. These include the Group of Seven, the European Union, and Australia. They have decided that Russian oil cannot be sold for more than $60 per barrel. This rule started on December 5.

Hello, I am Léonie Chao-Fong, and I am in London. I will give you the latest news from Ukraine. You can contact me on Twitter or by email.

The leaders of the defense departments from Russia, Turkey, and Syria met in Moscow today. They talked about the war in Syria and the problem of refugees. They also discussed how to fight groups that use violence in Syria. This information comes from Russian news.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the leader of Ukraine, said that very few people still live in Bakhmut. Bakhmut is a city in eastern Ukraine where there is a lot of fighting. Zelenskiy said that the city is full of blood. He said that his soldiers are fighting a very difficult battle there. This battle has become a symbol of how brutal the war is.

Zelenskiy said that last year, 70,000 people lived in Bakhmut. Now, only a few people are left. He said that there is blood everywhere, and there is constant loud noise from the fighting."
37,37_7,7,"Still, Bakhmut stands. Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of 70,000-80,000, is a ghost town now largely in ruins. The deterioration of diplomatic relations between Russia and Lithuania has continued, with the expulsion today of a Lithuanian from their embassy in Moscow. A statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: On 28 December, Chargé d’Affaires of Lithuania in Russia, Jurgita Cibulskiene was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Lithuanian side was strongly protested in connection with the unjustified expulsion on 1 December this year [of an] employee of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. As a response, one of the diplomats of the Lithuanian embassy was declared “persona non grata”, and must leave the territory of the Russian Federation within five days. Reuters reported that ship insurers have said they are cancelling war risk cover across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, after an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses. Reinsurers, which insure the insurers, typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on 1 January, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started. The moves by the insurers will make it harder for ship-owners or charterers to find insurance, increase prices and may mean some ships sail uninsured, industry sources said. Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, has tweeted images of a maternity hospital in Kherson city that was shelled by Russian forces yesterday. According to Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Two babies were born at the hospital the day of the attack, Liashko wrote on his Facebook, adding that one arrived just “minutes” before the shelling. He added: Fortunately, no babies ... no hospital staff were hurt this time. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. The European Commission says it is donating €14m (£12.3m) to buy and transport school buses for Ukraine, as well as an additional 120 buses “to bring Ukrainian children safely to school”.","Bakhmut is still standing. Before the war, 70,000 to 80,000 people lived there. Now, Bakhmut is mostly destroyed. It is like a ghost town.

The relationship between Russia and Lithuania is getting worse. Russia kicked a Lithuanian person out of the Lithuanian embassy in Moscow today.

The Russian foreign ministry said something. On December 28, they called Jurgita Cibulskiene to the ministry. She is in charge of the Lithuanian embassy in Russia.

Russia said they were angry. They did not like that Lithuania kicked out a Russian embassy worker on December 1.

So, Russia kicked out a Lithuanian diplomat. They said the diplomat is ""persona non grata."" This means Russia does not want them in Russia. The diplomat must leave Russia in five days.

Reuters said that companies that insure ships are stopping their war insurance in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.

These insurance companies lost a lot of money. The companies that insure them (reinsurers) are leaving the area. Reinsurers usually renew contracts on January 1. This is their first chance to reduce their risk since the war started.

This will make it harder for ship owners to find insurance. The cost of insurance will go up. Some ships might sail without any insurance.

Emine Dzheppar, a top official in Ukraine's foreign ministry, posted pictures on Twitter. The pictures showed a hospital for babies in Kherson that was hit by Russian bombs yesterday.

Viktor Liashko, Ukraine's health minister, said that Russian forces bombed the hospital right after a baby was born.

He wrote on Facebook that two babies were born that day. One baby was born just before the bombing. He said that luckily, no babies or hospital workers were hurt this time.

We cannot check if his story is true.

The European Commission is giving 14 million euros to Ukraine. They will use the money to buy buses for schools. They are also giving 120 more buses. These buses will help Ukrainian children get to school safely."
37,37_8,8,"About 5.7 million school-age children in Ukraine have been affected by Russia’s war, which has also led to thousands of schools and educational facilities damaged or destroyed, the Commission said. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. The monument was first erected in 1900 but was dismantled in 1920 after the Bolshevik takeover. It was restored and reopened in 2007. After the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukraine’s parliament passed a “decommunisation” law that meant statues to Lenin and other Soviet political figures had to be removed (or, in the case of Odesa’s Lenin statue, reworked and reimagined as a statue to Darth Vader). Since Russia’s February invasion, however, many in Ukraine have sought a more overarching reevaluation of anything Russian, and the monument to Catherine had been daubed with red paint several times. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Authorities plan to store the monuments in a museum in the city. France’s armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has tweeted a photo of him visiting a memorial to the war dead in Kyiv as part of his visit to Ukraine. Lecornu, who is on his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May, is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army officials. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, has struck a cautious tone on whether his country would supply Ukraine with air defence systems. Speaking in an interview with Il Messaggero newspaper, Crosetto said the air defence systems, which Ukraine’s president has requested, would be provided to Kyiv “if possible”. He added: If we give air defence missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality.","Here's the rewritten text at a B2 level:

Many children in Ukraine are affected by the war. About 5.7 million children of school age are in danger. The war started by Russia has hurt many schools. Thousands of schools are damaged or destroyed. This information comes from a special group.

In the city of Odesa, something is happening. The government is taking down a statue. The statue is of Catherine the Great. She was a Russian leader. She started the city a long time ago, in the 1700s.

The statue was first built in 1900. But it was taken down in 1920. This happened after a big change in Russia called the Bolshevik takeover. The statue was put back up in 2007.

In 2014, Ukraine had a revolution called the Maidan revolution. After this, Ukraine made a new law. This law said that statues of Lenin and other Russian leaders from the Soviet time must be removed. One statue of Lenin in Odesa was changed into a statue of Darth Vader.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, many Ukrainians want to remove anything that reminds them of Russia. The statue of Catherine the Great was painted red many times.

Last month, the local government voted. They decided to take down the statue. They will also take down a statue of a general named Alexander Suvorov. He was a leader in the Russian army. The government will put the statues in a museum.

The Minister of Defense from France, Sébastien Lecornu, is visiting Ukraine. He put a picture on Twitter. The picture shows him at a place that remembers soldiers who died in the war. This is part of his trip to Ukraine.

This is Lecornu's first time in Ukraine since May. He will meet with the leader of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He will also meet with the defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army leaders.

The Minister of Defense from Italy, Guido Crosetto, is being careful. He is talking about giving Ukraine air defense systems. Ukraine wants these systems to protect the country from attacks from the air.

Crosetto said Italy will give Ukraine the systems ""if possible."" He said this in a newspaper interview. He also said that Italy needs the air defense missiles for themselves. If they give them to Ukraine, they must be sure they have enough for their own country. They also need to be sure the missiles are good quality."
37,37_9,9,"Crosetto’s comments came after Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke with Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Tuesday. In a tweet posted after the call, Ukraine’s leader said Meloni informed him that “the issue of providing air defence systems to protect Ukrainian skies is being considered”. A Swiss court has granted a six-month “stay of bankruptcy” to the company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was built to bring Russian gas to Germany but never opened after Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, a Swiss-based company owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom, built the gas pipeline but the project was halted in early February after Moscow formally recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. The company’s stay has now been extended to 10 July by a Swiss regional, Reuters cited a notice published in the Swiss official gazette of commerce as saying. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. The Russian Union of Lawyers head, Igor Trunov, told the state-owned news agency Tass the health ministry had agreed to his appeal to offer free cryobank services to the 300,000 soldiers conscripted in September. According to the lawyer, his organisation has already been contacted by several couples whose husbands will soon depart for Ukraine. The health ministry has not yet commented on Trunov’s remarks. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. Russia’s population has been in near-constant decline for decades. The coronavirus pandemic led to the country’s largest natural population decline since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The war in Ukraine, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of young Russian men while also sparking an unprecedented exodus of educated professionals, is expected to hasten the demographic crash for Russia. The independent demographer Alexei Raksha has described the current demographic situation as “the perfect storm”. Earlier we reported air raid alerts blared across Ukraine, including in Kyiv and Mykolaiv.","Here's a rewritten version of the text at a B2 level:

Crosetto spoke after a phone call. Volodymyr Zelenskiy talked to Italy's leader, Giorgia Meloni, on Tuesday.

After the call, Zelenskiy wrote a message online. He said Meloni told him they are thinking about giving Ukraine air defense systems. These systems would help protect Ukraine from air attacks.

A court in Switzerland made a decision. It gave the company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline six more months to avoid going bankrupt. This pipeline was built to send Russian gas to Germany. But it never opened because Vladimir Putin sent soldiers to Ukraine.

Nord Stream 2 AG is a company in Switzerland. It belongs to Gazprom, a big Russian gas company owned by the government. This company built the pipeline. The project stopped in February. This happened after Russia said two areas in eastern Ukraine were independent.

The Swiss court has now extended the company's time to July 10. This information came from a Swiss announcement, according to Reuters.

Russian soldiers going to fight in Ukraine can keep their sperm frozen for free. A top Russian lawyer said this.

Igor Trunov is the head of the Russian Union of Lawyers. He told a news agency that the health ministry agreed to his request. The ministry will offer free sperm freezing services to the 300,000 soldiers who were called up in September.

The lawyer said that many couples have already contacted his organization. Their husbands are leaving for Ukraine soon.

The health ministry has not said anything about Trunov's comments yet.

Experts who study population changes are worried. They say Putin's war in Ukraine and the calling up of soldiers could make Russia's population problem worse.

Russia's population has been decreasing for many years. The coronavirus pandemic caused the biggest drop in population since 1991, when the Soviet Union ended.

The war in Ukraine has caused many young Russian men to die. Also, many educated people have left the country. This is expected to make Russia's population decrease even faster.

Alexei Raksha, an expert on population, said the current situation is very bad. He called it ""the perfect storm.""

Earlier, we reported that warning sirens sounded in Ukraine. This included the cities of Kyiv and Mykolaiv. These sirens mean there might be an air attack."
37,37_10,10,"Officials have sounded the all-clear almost two hours later. There were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes. Ukrainian social media suggested the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off. Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine, forcing hundreds of civilians to flee the recently liberated city amid relentless shelling by Moscow’s troops. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said this morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in the city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added. At least 10 people were killed and 58 were wounded by a Russian strike in Kherson on Saturday, authorities said. Russian forces were forced to withdraw from Kherson city last month, but its residents have faced relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnieper River. About 400 people have fled Kherson since Christmas Day, the BBC reported, after a sharp increase in the intensity of the Russian bombardment of the city. The Kremlin has dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, and insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account today’s realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia. Plans that do not take these realities into account cannot be peaceful. Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk – in September after holding Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions. Kyiv and its western allies have said they would never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine’s territory.","The officials said that everything is safe now. This happened almost two hours after an alert. There are no new reports of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine.

People on Ukrainian social media think the alert started because Russian planes took off from Belarus.

Russian soldiers are attacking the city of Kherson with mortars and artillery. This is happening more often now. Many people are leaving the city because of the shelling. Kherson was recently freed from Russian control. But now, Moscow's soldiers are constantly firing at it.

The Ukrainian army said that Russian troops fired 33 rockets at Kherson in one day. They aimed at places where normal people live. They used planes and artillery to attack.

On Tuesday night, Russian forces shelled a hospital in Kherson. They hit the part of the hospital where babies are born. Kyrylo Tymoshenko said this. He works for the President. He said that nobody was hurt. The workers and patients were moved to a safe place.

Last Saturday, a Russian attack in Kherson killed at least ten people. 58 people were hurt.

Russian soldiers had to leave Kherson last month. But they are still shooting at the city from the other side of the Dnieper River. The people who live in Kherson are still in danger.

The BBC says that about 400 people have left Kherson since Christmas. This is because Russia is attacking the city more often.

The Kremlin does not agree with President Zelenskiy's peace plan. He has ten ideas to stop the war. The Kremlin says that any peace plan must consider that Russia now controls four regions of Ukraine.

Dmitry Peskov works for the Kremlin. He said that there can be no peace plan if it does not include the fact that four regions are now part of Russia. He said that plans that ignore this cannot bring peace.

Russia took over four regions of Ukraine in September: Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk. They held fake votes to make it look like the people in these regions wanted to join Russia. But this was not a real vote.

Russia does not fully control all of these regions. Kyiv and its allies say that they will never accept Russia's claims to Ukrainian land."
37,37_11,11,"President Zelenskiy has been promoting his 10-point peace plan, first announced in November, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskiy’s foreign minister, Dmtryo Kuleba, said on Monday that Ukraine was aiming to hold a peace summit by the end of February – preferably at the UN with its secretary general, António Guterres, as a possible mediator. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The Kyiv Post has reported that the French armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has arrived in Kyiv. It is his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May 2022. France24 reporter Andrew Hilliar has said Lecornu is expected to visit a memorial to the war dead today, and that the trip comes on the back of the promise by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to increase his nation’s military support for Ukraine. Hilliar reports that Lecornu is under pressure to announce further assistance, with some in Ukraine still angry at Macron’s comments during the course of the war, where he has seemed more vocal than most European leaders to suggest that Ukraine should be prepared to make concessions in return for peace. Reuters reports that one of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head ofRussia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed “official” in the occupied region. In a picture published by Rogov on Telegram, Kiriyenko was seen outside the plant.","President Zelenskiy wants peace in Ukraine. He shared a plan with 10 points in November. The plan says Ukraine should get its land back. Russian soldiers should leave. All prisoners should be freed. People who started the war should be judged in court. Ukraine should be safe in the future.

Dmytro Kuleba is Ukraine's foreign minister. He said Ukraine wants a peace meeting soon. He hopes it will happen by the end of February. He wants the meeting to be at the United Nations. António Guterres could help. He is the leader of the UN.

Hello, I'm Léonie Chao-Fong. I will give you the latest news about the war. You can contact me on Twitter or by email.

Here are some new pictures from Ukraine.

The Kyiv Post says a French minister is in Kyiv. His name is Sébastien Lecornu. He is in charge of France's army. This is his first visit to Ukraine since May 2022.

Andrew Hilliar works for France24. He said Lecornu will visit a place for dead soldiers today. The president of France promised to help Ukraine more. That is why Lecornu is visiting.

Hilliar said people want Lecornu to announce more help. Some people in Ukraine are angry at France's president. He said Ukraine should give up some things to get peace. Other leaders did not say this.

Reuters says someone from the Kremlin visited a nuclear power plant. The plant is in Zaporizhzhia, in southern Ukraine. Russia controls this area. Russia says it now owns this land.

Sergei Kiriyenko works for President Putin. He is in charge of Russia's politics. He used to be in charge of Russia's nuclear company. He talked about the safety of the plant. Vladimir Rogov said this. Rogov works for Russia in the area. Rogov posted a picture on Telegram. It showed Kiriyenko outside the plant."
37,37_12,12,"The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has tweeted to reiterate the support the US is providing to keep energy systems running in Ukraine, following Russia’s sustained attacks on the energy infrastructure that civilians rely on. The ambassador said the embassy in Kyiv is “proud to carry out the secretary of state’s mission to work day and night with Ukrainian partners to help keep the energy grid up and running through the winter. We stand with Ukraine.” Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. Associated Press reports that in an interview with the minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian official said: The next stage, now that we are more or less equipped with reconnaissance drones, is strike drones. These are both exploding drones and drones that fly up to 3 to 10km and hit targets. I can say already that the situation regarding drones will change drastically in February or March. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. In the last few moments, authorities in Kyiv and Mykolaiv have declared air raid alerts, according to posts on Telegram. The state-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting that Russian authorities claim to have thwarted a Ukrainian-sponsored terrorist attack in Chegem in the Kabardino-Balkarian republic, which is near Russia’s border with Georgia. It reports: The federal security service stopped the activities of two previously convicted Russian citizens who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services, were preparing a terrorist act in the city of Chegem. After committing the crime, they planned to leave for Ukraine to take part in hostilities against the Russian armed forces. At the scene of the clash, they found an improvised explosive device with a capacity of about 2kg in TNT equivalent, an AK-74 assault rifle, a pistol and ammunition. The report states that the two suspects were killed. No evidence was offered for the claims of the Russian security services.","The US ambassador in Ukraine is Bridget Brink. She posted on Twitter about US support for Ukraine. The US wants to help Ukraine keep its energy working. Russia has been attacking Ukraine's energy system. This system is important for people.

The ambassador said the US embassy in Kyiv is working hard. They are helping Ukraine keep the energy grid working during winter. She said the US supports Ukraine.

Ukraine has bought many drones. They have 1,400 drones. Most of these drones are for finding information. Ukraine plans to make drones that can attack. These drones will be like the exploding drones Russia uses.

A Ukrainian government minister talked about this. His name is Mykhailo Fedorov. He said Ukraine now has enough drones to find information. The next step is to make drones that can attack.

He said some of these drones will explode. Other drones will fly far and hit targets. He thinks the situation with drones will change a lot soon. This will happen in February or March.

Ukraine has not said much about explosions in Russia. It is not clear if these explosions are from Ukrainian military actions or drones.

Recently, there were air raid alerts in Kyiv and Mykolaiv. This information was shared on Telegram.

The Russian news agency Tass said something else. Russian authorities said they stopped a terrorist attack. They said it was planned by Ukraine. This happened in a place called Chegem. Chegem is near Russia's border with Georgia.

Tass said the Russian security service stopped two people. These people were planning a terrorist attack in Chegem. They were told to do this by Ukrainian special services. After the attack, they planned to go to Ukraine. They wanted to fight against the Russian army.

Tass said the security service found explosives, a rifle, a pistol, and bullets. They said the two people were killed. Russia did not show any proof for these claims."
37,37_13,13,"Adeshola Ore and Amy Remeikis report for the Guardian: The mother of an Australian man from Victoria killed fighting in Ukraine has remembered her son as a defender of freedom who was driven by empathy. The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. His mother, in a statement released via Dfat, said her son had fallen in love with Ukraine and was “humbled by the kindness and hospitality within his new community”. “Sage died in action defending the freedom of the Ukrainian people,” she said. “Sage has always believed in defending country, people and the right for freedom.” She said her son upheld his values as he served in Australia and abroad in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and described her son as driven by “empathy for the Ukrainian people” at the “injustice that has taken place”. Sage’s mother was not named in the statement, but said her family was devastated by their loss and would remember Sage’s “humour, kind heart and laughter”. Read more here: Australian man who died fighting in Ukraine remembered as ‘defender of freedom’ Oleh Synyehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region that borders two of the areas in the east of Ukraine – Luhansk and Donetsk – which Russia has claimed to annex, has posted to Telegram to say one person has been wounded due to enemy action. He said: A 48-year-old man received a shrapnel wound as a result of the morning attacks of the occupiers on Kharkiv. He is in the hospital in a moderate condition. The claim has not been independently verified. An “official” channel of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) – one of the areas of Ukraine that Russia claimed to have annexed in September – has posted on Telegram to say in the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have fired at seven of the settlements the DPR claims as its territory. It says one civilian was injured, and two houses and three civilian infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

Adeshola Ore and Amy Remeikis are writing for the Guardian newspaper. They wrote about an Australian man who died in Ukraine.

The man's name was Sage O'Donnell. He was from Victoria, Australia. He was fighting in Ukraine. His mother said he was fighting for freedom.

The Australian government said that Sage O'Donnell died on Wednesday. His mother made a statement. She said her son loved Ukraine. He liked the people there.

She said Sage died while fighting for the freedom of Ukrainian people. She said Sage always believed in protecting countries, people, and freedom.

He believed in his values. He fought in Australia and in Ukraine. He felt sorry for the Ukrainian people. He thought it was wrong what was happening there.

The mother's name was not in the statement. She said her family is very sad. They will remember Sage's funny personality, his kind heart, and his laughter.

Oleh Synyehubov is the governor of the Kharkiv region. This region is next to Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia says it now controls these areas. He said that someone was hurt because of the fighting.

He wrote on Telegram that a man got hurt in Kharkiv. The man is 48 years old. He was hit by a small piece of metal. He is in the hospital. He is okay. This information has not been checked.

A group called the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) wrote on Telegram. Russia says it now controls this group's area. The DPR said that Ukrainian soldiers shot at seven towns in the last day. They say one person was hurt. Two houses and three buildings were damaged. This information has also not been checked."
37,37_14,14,"Russia, Syria and North Korea were the only UN member states to recognise the DPR as any kind of legitimate authority before the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, declared it was territory of the Russian Federation. The European Union delegation to Ukraine has announced that it will support “more than 700,000 Ukrainians in the winter” during the war. In a press statement released on Wednesday, the office of the international organisation for migration (IOM) in Ukraine says it is “stepping up efforts to help internally displaced and war-affected people survive the cold weather”. The statement claims that: IOM’s winter preparedness support, made possible by EU funding, includes repairs to collective centres for displaced people, improvements to water, drainage and heating systems, repairs to damaged houses, and the provision of warm blankets, bedding, mattresses and hygiene items. The programme also provides solid fuel and cash assistance to help people have flexible winter livelihoods. This funding will also enable IOM to ensure the availability of critical assets to ensure that aid continues to reach war-affected populations, and to support partner organisations responding to urgent needs on the ground. Claudia Amaral, head of the European Commission’s directorate-general for civil protection and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, is quoted as saying: Vulnerable sections of the population of Ukraine are going through the hardest winter. As the attacks continue, leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating and water, our humanitarian partners, including IOM, continue to work to meet the most urgent needs. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv region in Ukraine’s west, has posted to Telegram to say that it was quiet overnight in the region. He said there was one air alert yesterday, a warning of cruise missiles being fired from Belarus in the north, but that the danger “did not materialise”. The official Telegram channel of the Kyiv city state administration has posted to say that there are air raid warnings in effect in Ukraine’s capital. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Russian forces have fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in the Ukrainian city of Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said on Telegram.","Only Russia, Syria, and North Korea said that the DPR was a real government. This was before Russia said the DPR was part of Russia. Vladimir Putin is the president of Russia.

The European Union will help Ukrainian people this winter. They will help more than 700,000 people. This is because of the war.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is also helping. They will help people who had to leave their homes and people who are hurt by the war. They want to help them stay safe in the cold.

The IOM can do this because of money from the European Union. They will fix places where people are staying. They will make the water, heating, and drainage better. They will fix houses that are broken. They will give people warm blankets, beds, and soap.

The IOM will also give people fuel for heating and money. This will help them earn a living during the winter. The money will also help the IOM get important things to help people. They will also help other groups that are helping people on the ground.

Claudia Amaral works for the European Commission. She said that this winter is very hard for Ukrainians. Many people do not have electricity, heating, or water. The IOM and other groups are working hard to help them.

Maksym Kozytskyi is the governor of Lviv. He said that it was quiet in his area last night. There was one warning about missiles from Belarus. But the missiles did not come.

There are air raid warnings in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. This means people need to be careful.

The Ukrainian military said that Russia shot 33 rockets at Kherson. These rockets hit places where normal people live. This happened in the last 24 hours."
37,37_15,15,"Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says that fighting has intensified, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines. Russian troops who have been part of a mobilisation drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, the state TASS agency reported on Wednesday. Citing Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan. The ministry “determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilised to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024”, Trunov was quoted as saying. Families can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so. More on Russia’s response to the oil price cap, via Reuters: Under the cap, oil traders who want to retain access to Western financing for such crucial aspects of global shipping as insurance must promise not to pay above $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil. That is close to the current price for Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia was able to sell it for much of the past year, when windfall energy profits helped Moscow offset the impact of financial sanctions. The decree from Putin, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to “actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them”. The Kremlin ban would halt crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from 1 February to 1 July 2023. A separate ban on refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel would take effect on a date to be set by the government. Putin would have authority to overrule the measures in special cases. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and any actual disruption to its sales would have far-reaching consequences for global energy supplies. Russia retaliated on Tuesday against a price cap on its oil imposed by Western countries, while its forces were involved in heavy fighting around the bombed-out ghost town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.","Here's the rewritten text in simpler English:

Fighting in Ukraine is getting worse. A military expert from Ukraine, Oleh Zhdanov, said that Russia is using more tanks. They are also using more armored vehicles on the front lines. This information comes from Reuters news.

Russian soldiers are being sent to fight in Ukraine. These soldiers can now freeze their sperm for free. This will be done in special banks called cryobanks. The Russian news agency TASS reported this on Wednesday.

Igor Trunov, who is the head of a lawyers group in Russia, said this. He said that the Health Ministry will help with money. The money will pay for freezing and keeping the sperm. This is for soldiers fighting in the war from 2022 to 2024.

Families can also use this sperm for free. They can use it if their health insurance allows them to.

There is a new limit on the price of Russian oil. Reuters news has more information about this. Countries that buy Russian oil must follow this rule. They cannot pay more than $60 for each barrel of oil. If they want to use Western money for things like shipping insurance, they must follow this rule.

The price of Russian oil is close to $60 right now. But Russia used to sell its oil for much more. They made a lot of money from oil. This money helped them deal with money problems from other countries.

Putin made a new rule because of the oil price limit. He said it was because the United States and other countries were being unfriendly. He also said they were not following international rules.

Russia will stop selling oil to countries that follow the price limit. This will start on February 1st and end on July 1st, 2023. They will also stop selling gasoline and diesel later. The government will decide when that will start.

Putin can change these rules if he wants to in special situations.

Russia sells more oil than any other country except Saudi Arabia. If Russia stops selling oil, it will cause problems for the world's energy supply.

Western countries put a price limit on Russian oil. Russia is fighting back against this. At the same time, there is heavy fighting in Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine. The city has been bombed and is almost empty."
37,37_16,16,"Despite an intensification in the fighting the frontline in eastern Ukraine remains little changed, with neither side making any major advances, said Britain’s Ministry of Defence and Ukraine military analysts. Moscow will ban oil sales to countries that abide by the price cap that was imposed on 5 December, President Vladimir Putin decreed. The price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Moscow’s military efforts in Ukraine - without upsetting markets by actually blocking Russian supply. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The agency says the actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. The UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) says that since the start of the war, at least 6,884 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, including 429 children. However, the agency believes that the actual figures are “considerably higher”. We’ll have more on this story shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure.","Here's the rewritten text, broken down into simpler sentences and vocabulary, and avoiding complex grammar:

The fighting in eastern Ukraine is still strong. But the battle lines have not changed much. Britain's Ministry of Defence said this. Ukrainian experts agree. Neither side is winning big victories.

Russia will stop selling oil. This will happen to countries that follow the price limit. The price limit started on December 5th. President Vladimir Putin made this decision.

The price limit is new. It is different from the Cold War. The Cold War was between the West and the Soviet Union. The price limit tries to hurt Russia's war effort. It wants to do this without stopping all Russian oil sales.

The United Nations has counted the people killed in Ukraine. This is since the war started. They say 6,884 people have died. This includes 429 children. The time period is from February 24, 2022, to December 26, 2022.

The UN thinks the real number is higher. It is hard to get information from places with heavy fighting. Some reports need to be checked.

Hello. I am Helen Sullivan. I will tell you about the war in Ukraine.

The UN says many people have died. At least 6,884 civilians have been killed. 429 of them were children. The UN thinks the number is higher. We will talk about this more soon.

Here are some important things that happened recently:

Russia will not sell oil to countries with the price limit. This starts on February 1, 2023. It will last for five months. President Putin signed this order.

The Group of Seven countries, the European Union, and Australia agreed to a price limit. It is $60 per barrel of Russian oil. This started on December 5th.

Ukrainian soldiers are getting closer to Kreminna. Kreminna is a city controlled by Russia. It is in Luhansk province. Serhiy Haidai is the governor of Luhansk. He said Russian soldiers had to move back. They went to Rubizhne. Rubizhne is a town nearby. They moved because of the Ukrainian army."
37,37_17,17,"Heavy fighting continues in the east and south of the country amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, Britain’s defence ministry said in its daily military briefing on Tuesday. Russia’s military has moved many of its warplanes from Engels airbase to other locations after strikes on the crucial airbase, according to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force. Three Russian servicemen were killed on Monday after a Ukrainian drone attack on the airbase, which lies deep inside Russian territory, according to Russia’s defence ministry. Putin’s comments that he was “ready to negotiate with all parties” involved in the conflict in Ukraine are part of a deliberate information campaign aimed at misleading the west into making concessions, according to analysts. The US thinktank Institute for the Study of War said the Russian president did not offer to negotiate with Ukraine on Saturday, contrary to some reporting. The bodies of 42 Ukrainian servicemen who died while fighting have been returned to Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. Work on bringing back the bodies of Ukraine’s fighters “does not stop for a day”, Oleh Kotenko, the commissioner for missing persons, said. Vladimir Putin met his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, twice in the past 24 hours to “finalise many issues”, Belarusian state-owned Belta news agency reported. The meetings took place in St Petersburg, over breakfast on Tuesday at the Russian Museum, as well as at an informal summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) yesterday evening, it reported. A Russian sausage tycoon who reportedly criticised the war in Ukraine has died after falling from the third-floor window of a luxury hotel in India. The body of Pavel Antov, 65, was discovered just two days after his friend and another local Russian politician, Vladimir Bidenov, was found dead in the same hotel after an apparent heart attack.","There is still a lot of fighting in the east and south of the country. It does not look like peace talks will start soon.

If Ukraine takes back Kreminna and Svatove, they could attack Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these cities in the summer. The Guardian newspaper could not check if this is really happening.

British defence ministry said that Russian soldiers are still trying hard to capture Bakhmut. Bakhmut is a city in the Donetsk region.

A Ukrainian air force spokesperson said that Russia has moved many of its planes from Engels airbase. This happened after the airbase was attacked.

Russia's defence ministry said that three Russian soldiers died on Monday. This was because of a Ukrainian drone attack on the Engels airbase. The airbase is far inside Russia.

Putin said he is ""ready to talk with all parties"" about the war in Ukraine. Experts say this is a trick. He wants to fool the West into giving him what he wants.

The Institute for the Study of War in the US said that Putin did not offer to talk with Ukraine on Saturday. Some news reports said he did, but this is not true.

The Ukrainian government said that the bodies of 42 Ukrainian soldiers have been returned to Ukraine. These soldiers died fighting.

Oleh Kotenko is in charge of finding missing people. He said that they are working hard every day to find and bring back the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers.

Vladimir Putin met Alexander Lukashenko from Belarus twice in the last 24 hours. They met to talk about important things. This information comes from Belta, a news agency owned by the Belarus government.

The meetings were in St Petersburg. They had breakfast at the Russian Museum on Tuesday. They also met at a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) last night.

A Russian businessman who made sausages has died in India. His name was Pavel Antov, and he was 65 years old. He fell from a window on the third floor of a fancy hotel. It is said that he did not like the war in Ukraine.

Just two days before, another Russian politician named Vladimir Bidenov died in the same hotel. He was a friend of Pavel Antov. He seemed to have a heart attack."
38,38_0,0,"Pope Benedict XVI, who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, died on Saturday aged 95, three days after his successor, Pope Francis, warned the world that he was gravely ill. The Vatican announced that Francis would preside at Benedict’s funeral in St Peter’s Square on Thursday. From Monday, his body will lie at St Peter’s Basilica to allow the faithful to pay respects. Benedict’s death brings to a close an unprecedented period in recent history where two popes have coexisted, a situation that has caused tensions within rival camps in the Vatican. It eases the way for his successor, Pope Francis, to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point – impossible while the outcome would have been three popes. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer paid warm tribute to Benedict, referring to his 2010 visit to the UK as a historic moment. Other world leaders including Ireland’s Michael D Higgins, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Germany’s Olaf Scholz also issued tributes. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, said he was a scholar, pastor and a man of God who would be remembered for “his courtesy, his gentleness, the perceptiveness of his mind and the openness of his welcome to everybody that he met”. Justin Welby, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, said Benedict was “one of the greatest theologians of his age”. Earlier this week, Pope Francis announced during his weekly audience that Benedict was “very sick” and asked for people to pray for him. Benedict, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Germany in 1927, was a deeply conservative pontiff, whose tenure was overshadowed by sexual abuse scandals in the church. He retired leaving a chequered reputation after a papacy that was at times divisive. The son of a policeman, he grew up in rural Bavaria and at the age of 14 joined the Hitler Youth, a requirement, and served in the German army in the second world war.","Pope Benedict XVI died on Saturday. He was 95 years old. He used to be the leader of the Catholic Church. He was the Pope from 2005 to 2013. He stopped being Pope in 2013.

Pope Francis is the current Pope. Pope Francis said that Benedict was very sick three days before he died.

The Vatican announced something. The Vatican said that Pope Francis will lead Benedict's funeral. The funeral will be in St Peter’s Square on Thursday.

People can see Benedict's body starting on Monday. His body will be in St Peter’s Basilica. People who are Catholic can come and show respect.

Two Popes lived at the same time recently. This was new and unusual. It made some people in the Vatican have problems. Now that Benedict is dead, it might be easier for Pope Francis to stop being Pope in the future. It was hard to think about before with three Popes.

Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer spoke kindly about Benedict. They said his visit to the UK in 2010 was important.

Other leaders also spoke about Benedict. These leaders were from Ireland, France, Italy, and Germany.

Cardinal Vincent Nichols is a leader in the Catholic Church in England and Wales. He said Benedict was a smart man, a kind leader, and a man of God. He said people will remember Benedict as gentle and welcoming.

Justin Welby is a leader in the Anglican Church. He said Benedict was a great thinker.

Pope Francis said earlier that Benedict was ""very sick"". He asked people to pray for him.

Benedict was born in Germany in 1927. His name was Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger. He was a traditional Pope. His time as Pope had problems. There were scandals about bad things that happened in the church. He left after these problems.

His father was a policeman. He grew up in the countryside in Germany. When he was 14, he joined the Hitler Youth. He had to join. He also was in the German army during World War II."
38,38_1,1,"Towards the end of the war, he deserted and was briefly held as a prisoner of war by US forces. He later became a major figure in the Vatican and, as Cardinal Ratzinger, served as a right-hand man to his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. He headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a Vatican department once known as the Inquisition, for 24 years, a position that earned him the nickname “God’s rottweiler”. During his tenure, allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up began to surface. His critics said he failed to grasp the gravity of the crimes and the scale of the crisis, which reached a peak several years after he was elected pope in April 2005. As well as the flood of allegations, lawsuits and official reports relating to sexual abuse and the priests’ complicity in covering it up, the Vatican was also rocked by the theft of confidential documents, many of which later appeared in an exposé of alleged corruption. In October 2012, a Vatican court convicted the pope’s personal butler, Paolo Gabriele, of stealing the papers. He told the trial he had been acting against “evil and corruption”. Benedict held uncompromising positions on homosexuality and contraception. He had strongly opposed liberation theology, a radical movement that began in South American in the 1960s and advocated clerical social activism among the poor and marginalised. His sudden resignation at the age of 85, in February 2013, the first pope to do so since the middle ages, left the church reeling. He said at the time that he did not have the strength to carry on as leader of the world’s estimated 1.2 billion Catholics. “I have had to recognise my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me,” he said. He took the title of Pope Emeritus, and pledged to remain “hidden to the world”, devoting himself to private prayer. He retired to in a monastery in Vatican City, where he read, wrote letters and articles, received guests and played the piano. But the former pope remained a powerful conservative influence and a focus for opponents of Francis’s efforts to reform the church and redirect it to serving the poor.","Near the end of the war, he left the army. US soldiers caught him and held him for a short time.

Later, he became important in the Vatican. The Vatican is the center of the Catholic Church. He became Cardinal Ratzinger. He worked closely with Pope John Paul II. He was like the Pope's helper.

He was in charge of a Vatican group for 24 years. This group was once called the Inquisition. Some people called him ""God's rottweiler"" because of his strong views.

During this time, people started talking about priests hurting children. They said the church was hiding these crimes. Some people said he did not understand how serious these crimes were. They said he did not understand how big the problem was. The problem got worse after he became Pope in 2005.

There were many stories about the abuse. People sued the church. Official reports talked about the abuse and the priests who hid it.

Also, someone stole secret papers from the Vatican. These papers showed possible bad things happening in the church. In 2012, a court said the Pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele, stole the papers. He said he did it to fight ""evil and corruption.""

Benedict had strong ideas against homosexuality and using birth control. He also did not like liberation theology. This was a movement in South America. It said priests should help poor people.

He suddenly quit being Pope in 2013. He was 85 years old. He was the first Pope to quit in a very long time. This shocked the church. He said he was not strong enough to lead the Catholic Church anymore. There were about 1.2 billion Catholics in the world. He said he could not do his job well.

He became Pope Emeritus. He said he would stay ""hidden from the world."" He would pray in private. He moved to a monastery in the Vatican. There, he read, wrote, talked to people, and played piano.

But he was still a strong influence. He had old-fashioned ideas. Some people who did not like Pope Francis' changes supported him. Pope Francis wanted the church to help poor people more."
38,38_2,2,"He repeatedly made his views known through letters, articles and interviews. In April 2019, two months after Francis convened a groundbreaking Vatican conference on sexual abuse, Benedict published a 6,000-word letter saying abuse was a product of a culture of sexual freedom dating from the 1960s. In January 2020, Benedict publicly defended clerical celibacy, as Francis was considering allowing married men to become priests in limited circumstances. “I cannot keep silent,” he wrote in a book, From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church, arguing that priestly celibacy protected the mystery of the church. The controversy, which erupted just before The Two Popes – a film about the apparently warm relationship between Benedict and Francis – was aired on Netflix, exposed tensions between rival Vatican camps. Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Rome","He often shared what he thought. He did this by writing letters and articles. He also gave interviews.

In April 2019, something important happened. Pope Francis had a meeting about sexual abuse at the Vatican. It was a new kind of meeting. Two months later, Benedict wrote a long letter. It was 6,000 words long. In it, he said that sexual abuse came from a new way of thinking about sex. This started in the 1960s.

In January 2020, Benedict spoke about priests not getting married. This is called celibacy. Pope Francis was thinking about changing the rules. He might let married men become priests sometimes.

Benedict said he had to speak up. He wrote a book called ""From the Depths of Our Hearts."" The book was about priests, celibacy, and problems in the church. He said that celibacy helped protect the special meaning of the church.

This caused a big argument. It happened right before a movie called ""The Two Popes"" came out. The movie was about Benedict and Francis. It showed they had a good relationship. But the argument showed that there were problems between different groups in the Vatican.

Angela Giuffrida in Rome helped with this report."
39,39_0,0,"As a child in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso remembers excitedly readying himself in front of a handheld meat grinder to crush cashews. It was his part in his family’s annual tradition of preparing a 60-year-old recipe for Christmas cake that had been passed down for generations. Christmas cake – a moist, decadent treat filled with nuts and fruit – usually kicks off the holiday season on the island nation, and for immigrants in the US, has become a way to preserve traditions from back home. Sri Lanka’s Christmas cake is similar to the fruit cake, a quintessentially British dish, but has since evolved from its colonial roots. Like the British version, Christmas cake includes raisins and cherries, but also preserved ginger, the green vegetable chayote (or chow chow, as Sri Lankans call it) in sugar syrup, preserved melon (known as puhul dosi), candied peel, sultanas and aromatics like nutmeg. “It definitely has been adapted to the Sri Lankan palate,” says Cumaraiah-Misso, 34, now a medical student living in Fort Worth, Texas. He still remembers being a child and the earthy aromas of cinnamon and cardamom intermingling with the sweet smell of rose essence while being elbow-deep in a 25-gallon bucket, mixing finely chopped fruit semolina with butter. Marie Shirlene Fernando, 58, a caterer and mother of three living in Cerritos, California, remembers watching her aunt make the cake as a little girl. As a teenager, she took over the responsibility of making the stodgy treat, first for her ailing grandmother and later for her extended family to give as wedding favors. Now, she makes it with her 10-year-old granddaughter for customers across the United States. She carefully wraps the final product in parchment paper and brightly colored cellophane. This year, one of the packages will be shipped to her family in Sri Lanka.","Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso grew up in Colombo, Sri Lanka. He remembers being excited at Christmas time. He used a small tool to crush nuts. These nuts were cashews. He was helping his family make Christmas cake. The recipe was very old, about 60 years. It had been used by his family for many years.

Christmas cake is a sweet food. It has nuts and fruit. People in Sri Lanka eat it at Christmas. For people from Sri Lanka living in the US, it helps them remember their home.

Sri Lankan Christmas cake is like fruit cake. Fruit cake comes from Britain. But the Sri Lankan cake is different now. It has things like raisins and cherries, like the British cake. But it also has ginger, a green vegetable called chayote, and melon. These are kept in sugar. It also has spices like nutmeg.

Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso is 34 years old. He now lives in Texas. He remembers the smells when he was a child. He remembers cinnamon and cardamom. He also remembers rose. He mixed fruit, semolina, and butter in a big bucket.

Marie Shirlene Fernando is 58 years old. She lives in California. She watched her aunt make the cake when she was a little girl. When she was a teenager, she started making it. She made it for her grandmother. Later, she made it for her family for weddings. Now, she makes it with her granddaughter. Her granddaughter is 10 years old. They sell the cake to people all over the United States.

She wraps the cake carefully. She uses paper and colored plastic. This year, she will send a cake to her family in Sri Lanka."
39,39_1,1,"Given the country’s recent economic and political woes, she hopes the beloved dessert will help evoke unity and remind her mother, sister and extended family, of simpler times of gathering around the table to prepare the cake ingredients. In Sri Lanka, as the country’s hotels gear up for the holiday season, some host cake-mixing parties, where people get a view of culinary staff combining the fruit and nut mixture with the wet ingredients in a custom-built, 9ft-deep barrel. The mix weighs more than 4,000lb. This year, one even took place aboard a naval ship. Fernando said she was watching the Galle Face Hotel’s recent Christmas cake mixing ceremony and thought to herself, “Oh, I’m so glad in spite of all that’s going on, they are still doing it.” These traditions were in jeopardy this year as the nation battled its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Government corruption, financial mismanagement, sluggish economic growth since the pandemic, the depletion of foreign reserves and the war in Ukraine led to widespread blackouts, shortages of essential goods and school closures earlier this year. Islandwide protests ultimately led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the resignation of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. Inflation hit an all-time high of 69.8% in October before dropping slightly to 61% in November. While Fernando is hopeful that the nostalgia of Christmas cake-making will provide some joy to celebrations, Cumaraiah-Misso worries about how the increased prices of ingredients will affect this longstanding tradition. On local Facebook groups, bakers lament the rising cost of ingredients, with some commenting that they have chosen not to make the treat this year and are readying themselves for an “austere Christmas”. In a country ravaged by a 30-year civil war fought on ethnic lines and where, in 2019, at least 290 people died as bombs ripped through three churches on Easter Sunday, Christmas cake can unite across religions. It’s not just the 8% of the country’s Christian population that enjoy it. “There are so many Buddhists, Muslims, friends who I have who are non-Christians.","The country has had some problems recently. These problems are about money and politics. A woman hopes a special cake can help. She wants it to remind her family of happy times. She wants them to remember when they all made cakes together.

In Sri Lanka, hotels are getting ready for Christmas. Some hotels have parties to mix cake ingredients. People can watch the cooks mix fruit and nuts. The cooks also add wet things like milk. They mix it all in a big container. The mix is very heavy. This year, one party was even on a ship.

The woman saw a hotel mixing cake. She felt happy that they were still doing it. She was happy even though bad things are happening.

These traditions were in danger this year. The country had its worst money problems in a long time. There was corruption in the government. Money was not managed well. The economy was slow after the sickness. The country did not have much money from other countries. The war in Ukraine also made things worse. This caused problems like power cuts. It was hard to get things like food. Schools had to close. People protested. The president had to leave. The prime minister also quit. Prices went up a lot.

The woman hopes the cake will make people happy. But another person is worried. She is worried that the cake ingredients cost too much. This could hurt the tradition.

Some bakers are talking online. They are sad about the high prices. Some said they will not make the cake this year. They are getting ready for a simple Christmas.

The country had a long war. People fought because of their race. In 2019, many people died in church bombings. Christmas cake can bring people together. People of all religions enjoy it. It is not just for Christians. Many Buddhists and Muslims like it too."
39,39_2,2,"They love the Christmas cake, and they wait for a piece of Christmas cake,” Fernando said. She recalls them asking, “Where is my share? Did you keep me a piece?” Indrika Arnold, a wealth adviser in Lebanon, New Hampshire, has found another set of fans for her Christmas cake: her American co-workers. “I have some colleagues at work with whom I shared a piece, and they loved it. Now, they always ask, ‘When are you making your spice cake?’” she said. “I even mail it to some of my friends who no longer work with me.” She only made a half recipe when she started making Christmas cake five years ago. Now she’s doubled it. Arnold moved to the US 22 years ago but only started making the rich cake – as it’s known at other times of year – to share the tradition with her 12-year-old daughter. She has core memories of sitting around the kitchen table with her siblings and parents, cutting the preserved fruit into small pieces, and sneaking bits of raisins and cashews into her mouth when no one was looking. “A week or two before Thanksgiving, I get all the ingredients, and we actually get together as a family and cut it and we all take turns mixing the booze and the honey,” she said about how she continues this tradition with her daughter and husband in the US. She then leaves the fruits to stew in the alcohol mixture for at least two weeks, kick starting the holidays in their home. Like Arnold, Fernando also plans to gather around the table with her granddaughter to finely chop the fruit, which will then be soaked in a brandy mixture for one day. “By making it every Christmas, it has become a part of celebrating Christmas as Sri Lankans overseas,” Fernando said.","Fernando said that people really like her Christmas cake. They wait to eat it. They ask her, ""Where is my cake? Did you save some for me?""

Indrika Arnold works in Lebanon, New Hampshire. She gives Christmas cake to her American co-workers. They like it very much. Now they ask, ""When will you make your spice cake?"" She even sends cake to friends who used to work with her.

Five years ago, she started making a small amount of cake. Now, she makes twice as much. Arnold moved to the US 22 years ago. She started making the cake to share her traditions with her daughter. Her daughter is 12 years old.

She remembers making cake with her family when she was young. They sat at the table and cut fruit. She secretly ate raisins and cashews.

Now, she makes the cake with her husband and daughter. A few weeks before Thanksgiving, they get the ingredients. They cut the fruit together. They mix alcohol and honey. The fruit stays in the alcohol for two weeks. This starts the holiday season in their home.

Like Arnold, Fernando will make the cake with her granddaughter. They will cut the fruit into small pieces. Then, the fruit will sit in brandy for one day.

Fernando said making the cake every Christmas is important. It helps them celebrate Christmas as Sri Lankans living in another country."
40,40_0,0,"Father Happy Jacob has a reason to be cheerful. When he started St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church in Liverpool in 2002, his congregation numbered about 60 families, and stayed at that level for almost two decades. Then, a few years ago, things began to change. “We have seen a massive increase in families coming to the church,” says Jacob, 48. At his last count, there were 110 families, with worshippers including NHS workers, international students and about 100 school-age children. This story is being repeated across Britain. From Liverpool to London, Preston to Bristol, church congregations are being bolstered by Indian Christians. Most are from southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where Christianity is strong. Many have recently moved to the UK. The boom is in sharp contrast to the national trend. According to the latest census, Christianity is in decline in England and Wales: the portion of the population describing itself as Christian has fallen from 59.3% in 2011 to 46.2% in 2021. But the number of Indian Christians has surged over the same period. While they remain a small portion of the total number – about 27.5 million –who say they are Christian, the Indian contingent rose from 135,988 in 2011 to 225,935 in 2021, the fastest rise of any ethnic group. “There are lots and lots of Christians coming from India,” says Rev Joshva Raja of the British and Foreign Bible Society. As well as boosting dedicated Indian churches, the new arrivals are contributing particularly to Catholic congregations, but Raja says: “I see some of the Anglican churches growing too.” Some of those arriving grew up as part of protestant denominations that were founded in India after it gained independence in 1947. NHS worker Pradeep George, 42, secretary at the Church of South India in East Ham, east London, says the number of families attending has doubled since before Covid to about 80. Services are quite similar to Church of England ones, with hymns, bible readings and a few twists, such as plum cake – popular in Kerala. Jacob’s church in Liverpool is part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church, also known as Indian Orthodox, which traces its origins to the arrival of Saint Thomas in India in 52 AD.","Father Happy Jacob is happy. He started a church in Liverpool in 2002. It is called St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church.

At first, about 60 families went to the church. This number stayed the same for almost 20 years. Then, a few years ago, things changed.

Father Jacob says that more families are coming to the church now. He is 48 years old. He counted 110 families. People who come to the church include nurses and doctors from the NHS. There are also students from other countries. About 100 children who go to school also come.

This is happening in other places in Britain too. Churches in Liverpool, London, Preston, and Bristol are getting more people. These people are Indian Christians.

Most of them are from the south of India. They come from places like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Christianity is strong in these places. Many of these people have recently moved to the UK.

This is different from what is happening in the rest of the country. In England and Wales, the number of Christians is going down.

In 2011, about 59% of people said they were Christian. In 2021, only about 46% said they were Christian. But the number of Indian Christians has gone up.

Indian Christians are still a small part of all Christians. About 27.5 million people say they are Christian in total.

The number of Indian Christians grew from about 136,000 in 2011 to about 226,000 in 2021. This is the biggest increase for any group of people.

Reverend Joshva Raja works for a Bible company. He says that many Christians are coming from India.

These new people are helping Indian churches grow. They are also going to Catholic churches. Reverend Raja says that some Anglican churches are growing too.

Some of these people grew up in churches in India. These churches started after India became independent in 1947.

Pradeep George is 42 years old. He works for the NHS. He is the secretary at a church in East London. It is called the Church of South India. He says that the number of families coming to the church has doubled. Now, about 80 families come.

The church services are like Church of England services. They sing songs and read from the Bible. They also have some things that are special to them, like plum cake. This cake is popular in Kerala.

Father Jacob’s church in Liverpool is part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church. It is also called the Indian Orthodox church. They believe that Saint Thomas came to India in the year 52 AD."
40,40_1,1,"The church’s weekly “energetic gathering” lasts about two hours and is usually held in Malayalam, Kerala’s official language. Afterwards, people stay to socialise for much of the day, sharing foods such as appam – fluffy rice pancakes – lamb biryani or croissants with tea. There is also a Sunday school with about 100 pupils. Over Christmas, carol singers from St Thomas’s run a door-to-door service in Liverpool, Chester and beyond, visiting all the families from the congregation. This weekend, dressed in Christmas jumpers, they were in the living room of Suriya Varghese, 37, and her husband Anup Cherian, 40, who recently started attending the church with their three children. The Keralan family had been living in Qatar before moving to the UK last year after both parents got jobs as electrical design engineers for the same company. Their involvement with the church extends far beyond Sunday services. Their children – Abner, 10, Anika, 7, and Arush, 4 – attend the Sunday school, where Suriya teaches. They had help from the church network with everything from finding housing and applying for driving licences to coping with UK weather and picking trustworthy handymen. “The church plays a very big role in our lives,” says Anup. “This is about being part of the community, especially for the kids.” For Ephrem Sam Mattappallil and his friends, the support afforded by the church community has also been a lifeline. Mattappallil, 25, who moved to London last year to study, runs a support group for students within the Indian Orthodox Church, many of whom are “struggling”. Last year, it helped about 120 people. “Our parents, relatives and friends are not here, and there is financial pressure as well,” Mattappallil says. “Through the church, we can find a lot of friends, and share our experiences. It helped me a lot.” Elsewhere, Indian Christians are finding community in mainstream churches. At the Catholic church of St Osmund in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Father Jonathan Creer has been “surprised” and “delighted” by the trend.","The church has a meeting every week. It is a lively event. It lasts about two hours. The meeting is usually in Malayalam. This is the language of Kerala, a place in India.

After the meeting, people stay and talk. They spend much of the day together. They eat food together. They share foods like appam. Appam are soft rice pancakes. They also eat lamb biryani and croissants with tea.

The church also has a Sunday school. About 100 children go to this school.

At Christmas, people from the church sing carols. They go to different houses in Liverpool and Chester. They visit families from the church. This weekend, they wore Christmas clothes. They were in the house of Suriya and Anup. Suriya is 37 and Anup is 40. They recently started going to the church. They have three children.

The family is from Kerala. They lived in Qatar before. They moved to the UK last year. Suriya and Anup both work as engineers. They design electrical things for the same company.

The church is important to them. They do more than just go to church on Sundays. Their children go to Sunday school. The children are Abner, Anika, and Arush. They are 10, 7, and 4 years old. Suriya teaches at the Sunday school.

The church helped them a lot. They helped them find a house. They helped them get driving licenses. They helped them with the weather in the UK. They helped them find good people to fix things.

Anup says the church is important. It helps them be part of a group. This is good for the children.

Ephrem also thinks the church is important. He is 25. He moved to London last year to study. The church helps him and his friends. He runs a group to help students. Many students are having problems.

Last year, the group helped about 120 students. Ephrem says their family is not here. They also have money problems. The church helps them find friends. They can share their stories. It helped Ephrem a lot.

Some Indian Christians are also going to other churches. At a Catholic church in Salisbury, the priest is happy about this. His name is Father Jonathan."
40,40_2,2,"He said that in the past two years, mass attendance has been boosted by a “huge increase in the Indian community”, many of whom work at the local NHS hospital. The Indian families also include large numbers of children, teenagers and 20-somethings, who seem to have a more positive attitude to religion than some of their young British counterparts, he says. The increase has been particularly noticeable since the Covid lockdowns. “Some of our congregation – mostly older, white people – have still not come back, and some of them died, so it’s very noticeable now, looking out at mass, that we have many Asian and other faces,” Creer said. “It’s quite surprising in Salisbury, because you walk around the streets and it seems almost a mono-ethnic place, but actually, that’s not true.” He said that despite what some might think, the new arrivals had been really welcomed with open arms. “You might imagine that in a rather staid, middle-England place like Salisbury, people might wonder what was going on, but they have been delighted.” One way the congregation has embraced the Indian newcomers is by embracing a tradition observed in Kerala of passing around a “quite large” statue of the Virgin Mary, with a different worshipper taking it home each week. “People were very enthused about that,” Creer said. At other churches, Indian Christians have found themselves in the minority. Arun Vedhanayagam Selwyn, from Chennai in Tamil Nadu, began attending the Anglican St John the Baptist church in Eltham, south-east London, after moving to the UK last year. “It’s mostly people from the local area at services,” he says. “It’s very rare to see another person from India.” At 25, the master’s student at Greenwich university is also much younger than most of the other worshippers. “Mostly it’s old age people here,” he says. “Whereas in India, people from different age categories come to the church.” Nevertheless, he has found the community “very welcoming”. The services in Eltham are also more fun, he says.","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR B2 level:

The man said that more people are coming to church now. This has happened in the last two years.

A lot more people from India are coming. Many of them work at the local hospital. It is part of the National Health Service (NHS).

These Indian families have many children. They also have teenagers and young adults in their twenties. These young people seem to like religion more than some young British people.

He noticed this change after the Covid lockdowns. Some older people who used to come to church have not returned. Some of them have died. So, it is easy to see the change. Now, he sees many Asian faces at church.

He said this is surprising in Salisbury. When you walk around Salisbury, it seems like everyone is the same. But that is not true.

He also said that the new people are welcome. Some people might think people in Salisbury would not like the change. Salisbury is a quiet, traditional English place. But people are happy to have them.

The church has started a new tradition. It is from Kerala, a place in India. They pass around a statue of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Each week, a different person takes the statue home. People really liked this idea.

At other churches, Indian Christians are not many. Arun Vedhanayagam Selwyn is from Chennai in India. Chennai is in Tamil Nadu. He goes to a church in London. It is called St John the Baptist church.

He moved to the UK last year. Most people at the church are from the local area. He does not see many other people from India there.

He is 25 years old. He is a student at Greenwich University. Most of the people at the church are much older than him.

He said that in India, people of all ages go to church. But he feels welcome at the church in London.

He also thinks the church services in London are more fun."
40,40_3,3,"Back home in India, he says, they “drag the service out for hours” whereas here it’s “very compact, so no one gets bored. I like the vibe.”","Here in this new place, the service is short. Back in India, he says the service is long. It takes many hours. He thinks people here do not get bored. He likes the feeling of this place."
41,41_0,0,"It was 4am on a Monday and most of Rio de Janeiro was asleep. But in the Morro do 77, a favela on the gritty westside of town, the party was just getting under way as hundreds of revellers packed the community’s main thoroughfare to strut their stuff before a three-metre (10ft) wall of sound. Speakers and subwoofers pumped ear-shattering favela funk music into the dawn air. Partygoers drank pint-sized cups of whiskey and frozen coconut water. And as heads bobbed, bodies twerked and window panes shook, the rave’s unexpected name flashed up on a screen above the dancefloor in a distinctly British blaze of red, blue and white. “The Baile de Londres,” it said. “The Party of London.” “Sometimes people go straight to work afterwards,” said one of the DJs, Hyago Domingos de Lima, before his deafening setlist rendered conversation impossible. The Sunday night blowout – during which partygoers, including one wearing an England football shirt, danced until 7am – is one of scores of favela funk parties now named after cities and countries around the world. The trend began about five years ago when musicians in one of Rio’s largest favelas, the Complexo do Lins, founded the Baile da Colombia (the Party of Colombia), a reference to the Brazilian neighbour’s long-running conflict and the deadly violence that also blights many gang-controlled areas in Rio. Sensing a foreign name could increase their brand profile and attract larger audiences, event organisers in favelas across the city reached for their maps. In Chapadão they named their event after Egypt, in Parque das Missões, Poland, and in Parque Arará, Portugal. One favela opted for China and used the Chinese national flag to advertise its rave. Another chose Japan, in homage to a local gangster nicknamed after the east-Asian country. In São Gonçalo, a satellite city to Rio’s east, promoters picked US cities, including New York, Brooklyn and Las Vegas.","It was Monday morning at 4 am. Most people in Rio de Janeiro were sleeping. But in Morro do 77, a favela in the west part of the city, a party was starting.

Hundreds of people were on the street. They were dancing in front of a big wall of speakers. The speakers played very loud favela funk music.

People were drinking small cups of whiskey. They also drank frozen coconut water. They moved their heads and bodies to the music. The windows of the buildings were shaking.

A screen above the dance floor showed a name. The name was in red, blue, and white colors, like the British flag. It said, ""The Baile de Londres."" This means ""The Party of London.""

One of the DJs is Hyago Domingos de Lima. He said that some people go to work after the party. Then he started playing loud music. It was too loud to talk.

The party was on Sunday night. People danced until 7 am. One person wore an England football shirt. This party is one of many favela funk parties. These parties are named after cities and countries.

The idea started about five years ago. Musicians in Complexo do Lins, a big favela, started a party. They called it Baile da Colombia, or ""The Party of Colombia."" Colombia is a country next to Brazil. There is fighting and violence in Colombia. There is also violence in Rio's favelas, which are controlled by gangs.

The party organizers thought a foreign name would be good. They thought it would make their party more popular. They thought more people would come. So, they looked at maps and chose names.

In Chapadão, they named their party after Egypt. In Parque das Missões, they chose Poland. In Parque Arará, they chose Portugal. One favela chose China. They used the Chinese flag to advertise their party. Another favela chose Japan. This was because a gangster was nicknamed after Japan.

In São Gonçalo, a city near Rio, the party organizers chose US cities. They picked names like New York, Brooklyn, and Las Vegas."
41,41_1,1,"In Rocinha they celebrated Russia with the Baile de Moscow. In Jacarezinho they created the Baile de Paris. “I think there’s one named after every single country in the world,” said Kaio Gonçalves da Silva. The 26-year-old DJ plays at funk parties named after Acapulco and Saudi Arabia in Duque de Caxias, a city to Rio’s north. On his customised Sonic the Hedgehog motorbike, it takes him five minutes to get between the two gigs. “There the Party of Canada. There’s Libya. There’s Korea … There’s Croatia. There’s Sweden. I think there’s an Italy one too … There’s Ireland. There’s Scotland,” said Da Silva, AKA DJ Kaio VDM, the composer of a recent hit celebrating the Brazil and West Ham footballer Lucas Paquetá. Luiz Júnior, a DJ and producer from a westside favela called Vila Aliança, said that by the time the area’s musicians decided to adopt a country, “there were hardly any left”. So they plumped for Romania. “To be honest, I don’t know anything about Romania. Lots of people here don’t even know what the capital is … [But] people really liked the colour of the flag,” said Júnior, whose sound system, Ignorant, rents out massive custom-made speaker systems to parties including Argentina, Mexico and Iraq. Lima, whose DJ name is HG, came up with the Baile de Londres while shooting the breeze in Morro do 77’s main square with his friends Fatty Psycho, Haze, Xiclaudio and Big Dave. At first they considered Guatemala. Then someone floated England. But the Portuguese word for England (Inglaterra) had too many syllables and was a mouthful for MCs, he said. So they opted for the Baile de Londres and a new UK-themed Rio rave was born, with fliers featuring pictures of of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. Lima, who like most of the favela’s residents has never travelled abroad, admitted his knowledge of the UK capital was patchy.","In Rocinha, they had a party called ""Baile de Moscow."" This means ""Moscow Dance"" in Portuguese. In Jacarezinho, they had a party called ""Baile de Paris,"" or ""Paris Dance.""

Kaio Gonçalves da Silva is a 26-year-old DJ. He said he thinks there is a party named after every country.

DJ Kaio plays music at parties in Duque de Caxias. This city is north of Rio. The parties are named after places like Acapulco and Saudi Arabia.

He rides a Sonic the Hedgehog motorbike. It helps him travel between parties. It only takes him five minutes.

He said there is a ""Party of Canada."" There are also parties for Libya, Korea, Croatia, and Sweden. He thinks there is even one for Italy, and also one for Ireland and Scotland.

DJ Kaio VDM also writes music. He wrote a popular song about Lucas Paquetá. Paquetá is a soccer player from Brazil who plays for West Ham.

Luiz Júnior is a DJ and producer. He is from Vila Aliança, a favela in the west of Rio. He said that many musicians wanted to use country names for their parties. But many countries were already taken. So, they chose Romania.

He said he doesn't know much about Romania. Many people there do not know the capital city. But they liked the colors of the Romanian flag.

Luiz Júnior's sound system is called Ignorant. They rent big speakers to parties. These parties have names like Argentina, Mexico, and Iraq.

They first thought about Guatemala. Then someone said England. But the Portuguese word for England is ""Inglaterra."" It is too long for the MCs to say easily.

So, they chose ""Baile de Londres."" A new party was born with a UK theme. The flyers for the party have pictures of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye.

41,41_2,2,"“When I think of London I think of … all those big buildings and that lake with the bridge over it,” he said of Tower Bridge. Marcelo Henrique dos Anjos da Silva, a dancer whose mesmerising dance steps at the Baile de Londres often go viral social media, associated London with little but the cold. “It’s the sort of place you need a jacket and a scarf,” Da Silva, whose nickname is ML, said as he sat in Morro do 77’s plaza in flip-flops and shorts. The creation of the Party of London has given the Brazilian favela a curiously British feel. The main street, Francisco Brício Avenue, has been informally renamed the Retão de Londres, which roughly translates as London Street. Last year a local football team was founded: the Seleção de Londres or Team London. In true English style, they made it to the final of the favela’s annual tournament but then lost. “They thrashed us: 4-0 or something,” said Pedro Gomes, one of the team’s defenders, as he showed off the favela’s synthetic pitch wearing his union-flag-branded kit. Gomes, who works in a hospital pharmacy when not protecting London’s goal, said the baile was an essential form of leisure for overburdened residents of his deprived neighbourhood. “It’s a way locals have off enjoying themselves when all they do is work, work, work. People need to have fun too,” the 25-year-old said as the event’s giant sound system was assembled behind him outside the evangelical church Vida Em Graça (Life in Grace). Rio’s funk scene has long been criminalised and vilified by authorities and critics who accuse it of glorifying drugs, guns and sex, although in recent years the movement has been widely recognised as a culture treasure and even celebrated in one of Brazil’s top art museums. The parties are also a crucial economic lifeline for Rio’s favelas, which are home to about 20% of the city’s population.","""When I think about London,"" he said, ""I think about big buildings. I also think about the lake with a bridge."" He was talking about Tower Bridge.

The Party of London has made the Brazilian favela feel a little like England. The main street is called Francisco Bricio Avenue. People now call it Retão de Londres. This means ""London Street.""

Last year, a football team was started. It is called Seleção de Londres, or Team London. Like a real English team, they played in the final game of the yearly favela tournament. But they lost.

Pedro Gomes works at a hospital pharmacy. When he is not working, he plays football for Team London. He said the Baile is very important for the people who live here. It helps them relax. ""People work very hard,"" he said. ""They need to have fun too."" He is 25 years old. The sound system for the party was being set up behind him. It was outside the Vida Em Graça church.

The police and some people do not like the funk music scene in Rio. They say it is about drugs, guns, and sex. But now, many people think it is important culture. One of the best art museums in Brazil even celebrated it. These parties also help the favelas earn money. About 20% of the people in Rio live in favelas."

It’s stressful … When you get home you’re dead after working all night,” she said of her nocturnal shifts. “But I love this community. Acapulco is my life because, like it or not, I live off Acapulco.” Wagner Oliveira, the 32-year-old owner of a clothes shop in Vila Ideal named after the Mexican holiday destination, said: “People think bailes are just about taking drugs and boozing. But the bailes benefit so many people in the community.” A born-again Christian, Oliveira no longer attended the raves and was not a fan of the musical style and its sexually explicit lyrics. Nevertheless, he called the parties a vital part of favela life. “Only people who live here grasp how important this is. Outsiders just don’t get it at all.” Moments later, the volume was cranked up and partiers began to arrive for a night of unbroken hedonism. Oliveira shut up shop and headed home, placing Mexico’s Aztec-inspired tricolour in his shop window beside a note to would-be customers. “Be right back,” it said.","Adriana da Silva Lucena lived in Vila Ideal favela. One day before the Baile de Londres party, she left her house. She went to sell drinks at the Baile de Acapulco party.

She said life is hard. Without the parties, many people would be hungry. Adriana is 51 years old and a single mother. Many families in her area need help from the government.

Adriana said working at the parties is tiring and stressful. She works all night and feels very tired when she gets home. But she loves her community. Acapulco party is important to her because she earns money from it.

Wagner Oliveira is 32 years old. He owns a clothes shop in Vila Ideal. His shop is named after the Mexican place, Acapulco. Wagner said people think parties are just about drugs and alcohol. But he said the parties help many people in the community.

Then, the music got louder. People started to arrive for the party. They wanted to have fun all night. Wagner closed his shop and went home. He put a Mexican flag in his shop window. He also put a note that said he would be back soon."
42,42_0,0,"Production was suspended at the last operating domestic factory of Japanese automaker Daihatsu on Tuesday, as the Toyota subsidiary grapples with a safety testing scandal affecting 64 models going back more than three decades. Issues with falsified crash tests first came to light in April, when the firm admitted it had manipulated data on four models manufactured in Thailand and Malaysia from 2022 until this year. The company has since acknowledged that similar issues have occurred across almost its entire production process, with an internal investigation discovering falsified data dating back to 1989. “We betrayed the trust of our customers,” said Daihatsu CEO Soichiro Okudaira at a Tokyo press conference last week. “All the blame is on the management.” On 20 December the company announced it would halt shipments of all models while further investigations and safety checks are carried out. Initial investigations have found that the shortening of vehicle development time was likely the main cause of corners being cut on safety checks. Head of the investigating panel Makoto Kaiami said, “There was tremendous pressure on employees as altering sales schedules due to test failures was widely seen as unacceptable.” Daihatsu identified doors that can become difficult to open from the outside after an accident as the major safety issue, though there have been no reports of related injuries. Included in the 64 models are vehicles manufactured by Daihatsu under contract for Toyota, Mazda and Subaru. Production is currently set to be suspended at its factories across Japan until at least the end of January, affecting 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 suppliers. Daihatsu produced about 870,000 vehicles in Japan last year, a supply chain worth approximately 2.2tn yen (US$15bn). Daihatsu, which was founded in Osaka in 1907 and taken over by Toyota in 1967, is currently negotiating with unions and suppliers over compensation while production remains suspended. Although Japanese cars are known for their safety and reliability, the industry has been hit by numerous scandals over the years. In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors finally confessed to covering up defects in its vehicles dating back to 1977, after partially admitting to related problems four years earlier. Similar issues then emerged at its subsidiary Fuso Truck and Bus in what became one of Japan’s worst corporate scandals.","Daihatsu stopped making cars at its last factory in Japan on Tuesday. Daihatsu is a car company that belongs to Toyota. They have a problem with safety tests. This problem affects 64 different car models. These models were made over 30 years.

The problem started in April. Daihatsu said they changed the data from crash tests. These tests were for four car models. The cars were made in Thailand and Malaysia between 2022 and this year.

Now, the company says the problem is bigger. It affects almost all the cars they make. An investigation found that they changed data as far back as 1989.

The CEO of Daihatsu, Soichiro Okudaira, spoke about this in Tokyo last week. He said they broke the trust of their customers. He said the managers are to blame.

On December 20, the company said they would stop sending out all car models. They will do more investigations and safety checks.

The first investigations show that they did not have enough time to develop the cars. This may be why they did not do all the safety checks carefully.

The head of the investigation, Makoto Kaiami, said that the employees felt a lot of pressure. He said that changing the sales dates because of failed tests was not acceptable.

Daihatsu said the main safety problem is with the doors. After an accident, the doors might be hard to open from the outside. But, there have been no reports of injuries because of this.

The 64 car models include cars made for Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru. Daihatsu makes these cars for them.

The factories in Japan will stop making cars until at least the end of January. This affects 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 companies that supply parts.

Last year, Daihatsu made about 870,000 cars in Japan. The value of these cars is about 2.2 trillion yen (15 billion US dollars).

Daihatsu started in Osaka in 1907. Toyota took over the company in 1967. Daihatsu is talking to the workers and suppliers about money to help them while the factories are closed.

Japanese cars are known for being safe. But, there have been some problems in the car industry over the years.

In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors said they had been hiding problems with their cars since 1977. They had admitted to some problems four years before.

Then, similar problems happened at Fuso Truck and Bus, which belongs to Mitsubishi. This became one of the worst business problems in Japan."
42,42_1,1,"Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Subaru and Yamaha Motors were all embroiled in inspections and data-tampering scandals between 2017 and 2018. Daihatsu’s parent company Toyota paid a record $1.2bn settlement to the US Justice Department in 2014 over a series of claims about accelerator pedals and subsequent accidents. No mechanical fault was ever discovered despite numerous investigations and driver error remains the most likely explanation for the crashes that occurred.","Okay, here is the text rewritten for a CEFR B2 level (Elementary) English learner:

**Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Subaru, and Yamaha Motors had problems.** These problems happened between 2017 and 2018. They had issues with how they checked their cars. They also changed some data about the cars. This was not honest.

**Daihatsu is owned by Toyota.** In 2014, Toyota paid a lot of money to the US government. They paid $1.2 billion. This was because of some claims about the car pedals. People said the pedals caused accidents.

**Many people looked into these accidents.** They wanted to find out what was wrong. But they did not find any problems with the cars themselves. It is possible that the drivers made mistakes. Driver error may be the reason for the accidents."
43,43_0,0,"Before the arrival of Lundin Oil in the town of Leer, now part of South Sudan, life there was peaceful, says George Tai Kuony. His childhood was that of a “typical village boy”, driving cattle, helping his family and going to school. But in June 1998, when he was 15, armed forces entered the town and changed his life for ever. He fled, became separated from his family and hid for seven days before he was able to return. “When we got there, Leer wasn’t the town I had left seven days ago,” says the 40-year-old lawyer and human rights defender. “Everything was burned down, everything was destroyed. I could see the bodies of dead people lying in the street.” As a result of the conflict, he lost his father, and later his mother and one sibling. At the time, he says, the community had no idea why people were fighting. They had never heard of the Swedish oil company. Now, a quarter of a century later, Kuony hopes that he and the other victims will get justice as two former executives of the company go on trial in Stockholm accused of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sudan between 1999 and 2003. In Sweden’s largest-ever trial, Ian Lundin, a Swede, and Alex Schneiter, who is Swiss, stand accused of asking Sudan’s government to make its army and allied militia responsible for security at one of Lundin Oil’s exploration fields. This led to aerial bombings, civilian killings and the burning of entire villages, according to the prosecution. Both men deny the charges. The trial, which follows a decade-long investigation, hundreds of interviews and an 80,000-page report by the prosecution, started in September. But its most significant moments are expected in 2024, when 61 witnesses – including victims, Lundin employees, former UN staff and high-profile politicians – are due to appear. They include Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, who sat on the company’s board for five years until becoming the country’s foreign minister. “My life has never been the same,” says Kuony, speaking to the Observer from South Sudan’s capital, Juba, where he now lives.","Before Lundin Oil came to Leer, life was good. Leer is now in South Sudan. George Tai Kuony said life was peaceful then. He was a normal village boy. He took care of cows. He helped his family. He went to school.

But in 1998, things changed. George was 15 years old. Armed soldiers came to Leer. He had to run away. He lost his family. He hid for seven days. Then he went back to Leer.

George said Leer was not the same. Everything was burned. Everything was broken. He saw dead people in the street. He lost his father in the fighting. Later, he lost his mother and one brother.

George said the people did not know why they were fighting. They did not know about Lundin Oil. Lundin Oil is a company from Sweden.

Now, 25 years later, George wants justice. Two men who worked for Lundin Oil are going to court in Stockholm. They are accused of helping to commit war crimes in Sudan. The crimes happened between 1999 and 2003.

This is a very big trial in Sweden. Ian Lundin is from Sweden. Alex Schneiter is from Switzerland. They are accused of asking the Sudanese government for help. They wanted the army to protect Lundin Oil's work area.

The government army and other groups attacked people. They bombed from the air. They killed people. They burned villages. That is what the lawyers say. The two men say they did not do these things.

The trial started in September after ten years of investigation. The lawyers have a very long report with 80,000 pages. Many people will speak at the trial in 2024. There will be 61 people. They include people who were hurt, people who worked for Lundin Oil, people from the United Nations, and politicians.

Carl Bildt will also speak. He used to be the Prime Minister of Sweden. He also worked for Lundin Oil for five years. Then he became the Foreign Minister of Sweden.

George Kuony now lives in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. He said his life is not the same after what happened."
43,43_1,1,"“Oil came to our area: it should have been a blessing. It should have been for the benefit of the community.” Instead, there was “a massacre. They wanted us dead. They wanted us to go away.” Kuony has been trying to get justice since 2006, when the group unsuccessfully sought redress at a court in Sudan. He hopes the trial, whatever its outcome, will set a new legal precedent for global corporations working in foreign jurisdictions, sending a “very strong message” that they cannot act with impunity. “That one day they will be prosecuted in the same way.” But the victims have already been dealt a significant blow. Ebony Wade, a legal adviser at Stockholm-based human rights organisation Civil Rights Defenders, said Stockholm district court’s decision in November to separate the plaintiffs’ damage claims from the criminal trial would make it “significantly harder” – if not impossible – to have their cases heard, and would considerably delay the justice process. While the plaintiffs’ testimonies were still expected to be included in the criminal trial, she said, this could push the civil claims back until the criminal trial was over, which would not be until February 2026. However, May 2024 will be a historic moment: for the first time the court will hear the experiences of plaintiffs and victims from South Sudan. “It’s incredibly rare for corporate executives to be held accountable for grave human rights violation,” says Wade. “For the first time, the leadership of a multinational company is being put on trial in a European country on allegations that they were complicit in war crimes in the conduct of their business activities.” She adds: “There are very few opportunities for victims of grave international crimes to seek redress, so in that sense this is an incredibly important trial.” Rev James Ninrew Dong, of the Presbyterian Church in South Sudan, fled Leer after religious buildings were targeted. The priest, who is a witness and a plaintiff in the case, said he felt compelled to testify: “They attacked us. They displaced us. What made me sorry is that people came to the church seeking safety and were not able to get it. They were also displaced.” For him, the case demonstrates the different standards applied by European companies operating in Africa.","Oil was found in our area. It should have been a good thing for us. It should have helped our community. But instead, there was a terrible event. People were killed. They wanted us to die. They wanted us to leave our homes.

Kuony has been trying to get fairness since 2006. In that year, he tried to get help from a court in Sudan, but he was not successful. Now, he hopes this new trial will help. He hopes it will make a new rule for big companies that work in other countries. He wants to send a message to them. He wants them to know they cannot do bad things without being punished. He wants them to know they will be judged for their actions.

But the people who were hurt have already had a setback. Ebony Wade works for a human rights group. She said that the court in Stockholm made a decision. The court decided to separate the money claims from the criminal trial. This will make it much harder for the people to have their cases heard. It will also take a long time to get justice.

The people who were hurt will still be able to tell their stories in the criminal trial. But the money claims might not be heard until the criminal trial is over. The criminal trial might not be over until 2026.

However, May 2024 will be an important time. The court will listen to the stories of people from South Sudan for the first time. Wade said it is very rare for leaders of companies to be held responsible for human rights problems. This is the first time that leaders of a big company are being tried in a European country. They are accused of helping with war crimes through their business.

Wade also said that it is very hard for people who have been hurt by big international crimes to get help. So, this trial is very important.

Rev James Ninrew Dong is a priest from South Sudan. He had to leave his town because churches were attacked. He is a witness and is also asking for justice in this case. He said he had to tell his story. He said that people attacked them and made them leave their homes. He was sad because people went to the church to be safe, but they were not safe. They had to leave too.

He thinks this case shows that European companies have different rules when they work in Africa."
43,43_2,2,"“Sweden is the champion of peace in the whole of Europe and this is where the Nobel prize is always done,” he says. “We were surprised to see that some citizens of the same country do not even care and do not even listen to what the history is.” For the case to finally be in court is a relief, he adds. “Can they do that in Norway? Can they do that in Sweden? Can they do that in any of the European countries? Of course no – the answer is no.” • The headline of this article was amended on 16 January 2024 to refer to “South Sudanese” rather than “Sudanese” and a picture caption was amended to refer to Juba, South Sudan, not Juba, Sudan.","He said Sweden is very good at keeping peace in Europe. The Nobel Prize happens there every year. He was surprised that some people from the same country did not care. They also did not listen to their own history.

He feels better now that the case is in court. He asks if this could happen in Norway. He asks if this could happen in Sweden. Could this happen in any European country? He says no, it could not.

The title of this story was changed on January 16, 2024. It now says ""South Sudanese"" instead of ""Sudanese"". Also, the picture description was changed. It now says Juba, South Sudan, not Juba, Sudan."
44,44_0,0,"Accusations are growing that the former Sri Lankan government, led by strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, blocked an investigation into the country’s worst terrorist attack amid claims that they had helped orchestrate the blasts in order to return to power. In the attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019, six suicide bombers targeted churches and luxury hotels across the country, killing 269 people, including eight British tourists. But almost five years on, an investigation has failed to provide any answers for how the attacks took place and the security failures that led up to them. So far, there have been no criminal convictions. Instead, people previously involved in the investigation, and the leader of Sri Lanka’s Catholic church, have alleged that inquiries were repeatedly sabotaged and obstructed by the Rajapaksa government. In a recent documentary for Channel 4’s Dispatches, a whistleblower alleged that the attacks were part of a plan to create instability in Sri Lanka and ensure that Rajapaksa, a member of Sri Lanka’s most powerful political family, would win the presidential elections in 2019. The source said he had helped an intelligence officer with close ties to the Rajapaksa family meet members of the local Islamist militant group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ), that carried out the attack. He said it had been part of a plan that had been hatched over a couple of years to create an “unsafe” security situation that would help bring Rajapaksa to power. The Rajapaksa family had ruled Sri Lanka for almost a decade from 2005. They were credited with ending its bloody, 26-year-long civil war but became notorious for their authoritarian methods, including the use of “death squads” to target critics and journalists. Mahinda Rajapaksa was ousted in 2015 after a backlash against alleged corruption, but the family had planned a return to power in the 2019 election, this time with younger brother Gotabaya as the presidential candidate. He won the election but was toppled dramatically from power in July last year, after the country experienced a catastrophic economic crisis, and replaced by Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is seen as close to the Rajapaksa family.","People are saying the old government in Sri Lanka did something wrong. This government was led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He was a very powerful president.

Some people think his government stopped an investigation. The investigation was about a very bad terrorist attack. Some people say the government helped cause the attack. They might have done this to get back into power.

The attack happened on Easter Sunday in 2019. Six people killed themselves by bombing churches and hotels. 269 people died, including eight people from Britain.

It has been almost five years since the attack. But the investigation has not found answers. We don't know how the attack happened. We don't know why the security was so bad. No one has been found guilty of a crime.

Some people who worked on the investigation say something bad happened. The leader of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka also says something bad happened. They say the Rajapaksa government stopped the investigation many times.

A person who knows secret information spoke on TV. This person said the attack was part of a plan. The plan was to make Sri Lanka unsafe. This would help Rajapaksa win the election in 2019.

This person said he helped a man meet some people. The man worked for intelligence and was close to the Rajapaksa family. The people he met were part of a group. This group did the attack. The group was called National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ).

The person said the plan took a few years to make. The plan was to make things ""unsafe"" in Sri Lanka. This would help Rajapaksa become president.

The Rajapaksa family was in charge of Sri Lanka for almost ten years. They started in 2005. People said they helped end a long war. The war lasted 26 years. But the family became known for being very strict. They used bad methods, like killing people who criticized them.

Mahinda Rajapaksa lost power in 2015. People were angry about corruption. But the family wanted to come back to power in 2019. This time, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the candidate for president.

He won the election. But he lost power in July last year. Sri Lanka had a very bad economic problem. Ranil Wickremesinghe became president instead. People think he is friendly with the Rajapaksa family."
44,44_1,1,"Ravi Seneviratne, the former director general of police who initially led the Easter attacks investigation, told the Observer that after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected president, the government had “prevented the investigation”. He said his team had already “established links” between state and military intelligence officers and the NTJ suicide bombers. He said that the investigations had also led him to believe there was someone higher up helping to coordinate the attack who had yet to be apprehended. However, when Rajapaksa took office, Seneviratne’s entire team at CID was taken off the case. More than 20 of his officers were transferred without his approval and travel bans were imposed on all 700 CID officers. “The motive was to make them too scared to send a message. Many were too scared to work and some people even applied for transfers out of CID,” he said. Since then, Seneviratne claims there have been several attempts to “keep me quiet”. The targeting of those involved in the investigation took a murkier turn this month after the attorney general told the courts that there had been a conspiracy to murder Shani Abeysekara, the former head of Sri Lanka’s CID, who was overseeing the investigation before he was suddenly removed when the Rajapaska government came to power. A court petition filed by Abeysekara, which was taken up this month, said a plan to kill him in a staged vehicle accident had been uncovered. The petition identifie dhis involvement in the bombing investigation as one of the reasons for the assassination attempt. Upul Jayasuriya, the lawyer representing Abeysekara, said that his client’s involvement in the Easter bombing investigation was “one of the biggest problems”. Still fearful for his life, Abeysekara declined to comment directly on the case. Last year, Abeysekara went public with allegations that prior to the attacks – when the CID was already investigating NTJ militants – state and military intelligence officers had sabotaged the investigation and “fabricated” evidence to divert investigators away from the group, including ringleader Zahran Hashim, who later carried out one of the suicide bombings.","Ravi Seneviratne used to be the police chief. He led the first investigation into the Easter attacks. He told a newspaper that the government stopped the investigation after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president.

Seneviratne said his team found connections. These connections were between government workers, army officers, and the bombers. The bombers belonged to a group called NTJ.

He also thought someone important helped plan the attack. This person was not caught. But when Rajapaksa became president, Seneviratne's team was removed from the case.

More than 20 of his police officers were moved to new jobs. This happened without his permission. Also, 700 police officers could not leave the country.

Seneviratne said the government wanted to scare his team. They wanted to stop them from talking. Many officers were afraid to work. Some even asked to leave their jobs.

Seneviratne said people have tried to silence him. The situation became more complicated recently. The government lawyer told the court something important. He said someone planned to kill Shani Abeysekara.

Abeysekara used to be the head of the police. He was in charge of the investigation before Rajapaksa became president. He was suddenly removed from his job.

Abeysekara filed a paper with the court. He said someone planned to kill him in a fake car accident. The paper said he was targeted because of his work on the bombing investigation.

Upul Jayasuriya is Abeysekara's lawyer. He said the bombing investigation caused big problems for his client. Abeysekara is still afraid for his life. He does not want to talk about the case directly.

Last year, Abeysekara said something publicly. He said that before the attacks, his team was investigating the NTJ group. He said government and army officers stopped the investigation.

He also said they made up false evidence. They wanted to trick the investigators. They wanted them to focus on the wrong people. This included Zahran Hashim. He was the leader of the group and one of the suicide bombers."
44,44_2,2,"He has also alleged that his attempts to raise the issue of NTJ militants with the national security council had been obstructed. After the Easter bombings, he said, his investigators had established links and vidence of communication between intelligence officials and members of the NTJ group that carried out the attacks. Another former CID officer who was part of an investigation into NTJ militants months before the bombings, and who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, confirmed the accounts. “There were several attempts that were made by the military intelligence and state intelligence to sabotage the criminal investigation department’s work,” he said. While more than 200 people have been charged in the investigation, so far no one has been convicted, and there have been no answers on how several specific high-level warnings about the imminent attacks, particularly from Indian intelligence, were ignored. In January, former president Maithripala Sirisena, who was in power at the time of the attacks, was ordered by the supreme court to pay millions in compensation to the victims. Following the Dispatches revelations, the Sri Lankan government said it had set up a special parliamentary committee to investigate allegations, but sources said that no one had been called to testify before it. A recent statement by the ministry of defence said the government “vehemently denounces the accusation of orchestrating the attack and assisting the bombers against a dedicated senior military officer who has served the nation for 36 years”. The ministry added that “successive Sri Lankan governments have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth”. Gotabaya Rajapaksa could not be reached for comment. Among the harshest critics of the ongoing failures is Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka, who alleges there was a cover-up from the highest levels of government. “When Gotabaya Rajapaksa came to power, he appointed a stooge to take over the case who made a blunder of all investigations,” he said. “We know that there are several occasions when evidence was deliberately covered up.","He said that he tried to talk about NTJ fighters with the national security council. But he said people stopped him.

After the Easter bombings, he spoke. He said his investigators found connections. They found proof that intelligence officers talked to NTJ members. The NTJ group did the attacks.

Another former police officer also spoke. He worked on the NTJ case before the bombings. He wanted to stay anonymous to be safe. He said the same thing.

He said the military and state intelligence tried to stop the police from doing their job.

More than 200 people have been charged. But no one has been found guilty yet. People want to know why warnings were ignored. India sent warnings about the attacks. But no one listened.

In January, the court made a decision. Former president Maithripala Sirisena was told to pay money. This money was for the victims. He was president when the attacks happened.

After the news came out, the government said they would investigate. They made a special group in parliament. But some people said that no one had been asked to speak to the group.

The defence ministry said something too. They said they did not plan the attack. They said they did not help the bombers. They defended a military officer. He had worked for the country for 36 years.

The ministry said the governments in Sri Lanka want to find the truth.

People tried to contact Gotabaya Rajapaksa. But they could not reach him.

Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith is very critical. He is the head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka. He thinks the government is hiding something. He said the highest people in government are involved.

He said Gotabaya Rajapaksa chose someone to take over the case. This person made mistakes in the investigation. He said that evidence was hidden on purpose."
44,44_3,3,"They have made a mockery of transparency, a mockery of accountability and a mockery of democracy.” Ranjith added: “We are demanding a transparent, accountable investigation where the politicians don’t meddle with the investigators.” For the families of the victims, the lack of justice has been excruciating. “I ask God every day to take us too. How can we live with this pain?” said Sebastian Patrick Fernando, 74, who lost his son Neranjan in the attack on St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo. “We voted for the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government thinking they would give us answers. But they have done nothing, and now people say they did it to come to power. They should be held responsible.” Thilina Harshani, who was paralysed from the waist down and lost her six-year-old son in the blast, also blames the government for inaction. “Why did this happen to us?” she said. “Why did they bomb our church? Why were we targeted? And why are the masterminds still on the loose?”","Here's a rewritten version of the text at approximately a CEFR B2 level:

People are angry because things are not clear. They feel nobody is taking responsibility. They think democracy is not working. Ranjith said they want an investigation. He wants the investigation to be open and honest. He does not want politicians to control the people investigating.

The families of the people who died are suffering. It is very painful for them that they have not received justice. Sebastian Patrick Fernando lost his son. He asks God to let him die too. He cannot handle the pain. He said he voted for Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He thought the government would give them answers. But they have done nothing. Now, people think the government caused the problem to gain power. He thinks the government should be punished.

Thilina Harshani cannot move her legs. She lost her son in the bombing. She also blames the government for not doing anything. She asks why this happened to them. She wants to know why the church was bombed. She wants to know why they were attacked. She also wants to know why the people who planned the attack are still free."
45,45_0,0,"The US government has announced the release of what it said was its last available package of weapons available for Ukraine, with Congress needing to decide on future support. According to the state department, it is worth up to $250m and includes air defence munitions and components, Himars ammunition, 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, anti-armour munitions, and over 15m rounds of ammunition. The war in 2024 “must be different from 2023”, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces has said. “Otherwise we will face what I wrote about in the article [the Economist]”, said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi. “Unfortunately, I must state that the enemy is not far behind us. In recent days, we have had a powerful confrontation applying modern technologies. But we do not spare efforts. My main mistake was that I thought that the amount of losses we inflicted on the enemy would stop anyone. But not the Russian Federation.” Zaluzhnyi, giving a press conference, said Ukrainian troops remained on a defensive line in the northern part of Maryinka. “But I can say that this settlement no longer exists. The [Russian] method is the same as it was in Bakhmut. Street by street, block by block are destroyed. The fact that we have now moved to the outskirts of Maryinka, and in some places equipped positions beyond Maryinka, seems to me to be nothing that can cause a public outcry.” “As for the conduct of hostilities around Avdiivka,” he continued, “there is no need to dwell on it and make a show of it. The conduct of hostilities is subject to the laws of war, and they are not subject to what politicians or journalists want. The enemy now has the opportunity to concentrate forces; they can do to the city in two or three months what they have done to Bakhmut.” Two people were killed in Russian drone attacks on Odesa, according to figures from the Odesa oblast governor, Oleh Kiper. A 17-year-old was among the wounded and remained in hospital. Russian shelling left 70% of Kherson without electricity, said the Kherson oblast governor, Oleksandr Prokudin.","The United States government has said they are giving Ukraine one last set of weapons. Congress needs to decide if they will give more help in the future.

The weapons are worth about $250 million. They include things to help Ukraine fight planes and rockets. They also include bullets for guns called Himars. There are also many bullets for big guns and weapons to fight tanks. There are also more than 15 million normal bullets.

The leader of Ukraine's army said that the war in 2024 needs to be different than in 2023. He said if it is not different, they will have problems. He wrote about these problems in an article.

The leader also said that Russia is still fighting hard. He said that they are using new technology. He thought that the damage they caused Russia would stop them. But Russia is still fighting.

The leader said that Ukrainian soldiers are defending near a town called Maryinka. He said that the town is mostly destroyed. Russia is destroying it like they did in another town called Bakhmut. They are destroying it street by street. He said they have moved to the edge of Maryinka. He does not think this is a big problem.

He also talked about the fighting near Avdiivka. He said there is no need to talk about it too much. He said the fighting follows the rules of war. It does not matter what politicians or journalists want. Russia can now send more soldiers to Avdiivka. They could destroy the city in a few months, like they did to Bakhmut.

Two people died in Odesa because of Russian drone attacks. One of the people hurt was 17 years old. He is still in the hospital.

Russian bombs have made 70% of Kherson without power."

A railway station was attacked as a train was set to evacuate residents, killing one police officer and injuring four people. A Russian politician calling for peace in Ukraine has been denied the chance to run for president. Russia’s central election commission refused to accept the former regional legislator Yekaterina Duntsova’s initial nomination by a group of supporters, citing errors in the paperwork, including spelling. After losing Wednesday’s appeal against the commission’s decision, Duntsova said she would start working on the creation of her own political party that would stand for “peace, freedom and democracy”. Poland is getting closer to ending the truck driver blockades of several border crossings with Ukraine, says the country’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. Polish drivers have been blocking several crossings with Ukraine since 6 November, demanding the EU reinstate a system whereby Ukrainian companies need permits and the same for European truckers to enter Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks in Moscow with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and said progress had been made on plans for Russia and India to jointly produce military equipment. Jaishankar added that he expected Vladimir Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to meet next year. Russia says its newest howitzers will be deployed “soon” against Ukrainian forces. The head of the state-owned defence conglomerate Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, told the RIA news agency that testing of the new self-propelled artillery units, named Coalition-SV, had been completed and mass production had started, with the pilot batch to be delivered by the end of this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin must be stopped in his war against Ukraine or all of Europe will pay a much higher price, Moldova’s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, said in an interview published on Wednesday.","Here's the rewritten text at a B2 CEFR level, following your instructions:

**Shelling Damages City Infrastructure**

Russian soldiers shot at the city on Tuesday. This damaged the city's buildings and roads. It is hard to say when they will fix everything.

**Railway Station Attacked**

The soldiers attacked a train station. The train was going to take people away from the city. One police officer died. Four other people were hurt.

**Politician Denied Chance to Run for President**

A Russian politician wants peace in Ukraine. She cannot run for president. The election office said her papers had mistakes. There were spelling errors. She tried to appeal, but she lost. Now she will start a new political party. She wants peace, freedom, and democracy.

**Poland Close to Ending Border Blockades**

Poland is almost finished with the truck blockades. These blockades are at the border with Ukraine. Polish truck drivers started blocking the border on November 6. They want the EU to change the rules. They want Ukrainian companies to need permits. They also want European truckers to need permits to go to Ukraine.

**Russian and Indian Ministers Talk**

The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, met with the Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, in Moscow. They talked about making military equipment together. They have made progress on this plan. Jaishankar thinks Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi will meet next year.

**New Howitzers to be Used Soon**

Russia will use new howitzers against Ukraine soon. These are big guns. The name of the guns is Coalition-SV. They have finished testing them. They have started making many of them. They will send the first group by the end of this year.

**Moldova's President Speaks Out**

The president of Moldova, Maia Sandu, said something important. We must stop Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. If we don't, all of Europe will pay a big price."
46,46_0,0,"Just after 3 o’clock, the children start running towards the Arab-Jewish community centre. The activities are about to begin – though this is not the reason for their haste. Moments before, sirens wailed across Tel Aviv and Jaffa, warning of another rocket attack. Some cry out in fear as the metal shutters of the centre rattle down. Ten minutes later, after two loud booms signal that the rockets launched from Gaza have been destroyed in the air, the children file out of the malodorous basement of the centre and head for gym class, music lessons and a crafts session organised by an NGO that is trying to improve relations between Israel’s Jewish and Arab populations. Even the most enthusiastic of Standing Together’s activists and leaders admit that, after 11 weeks of war, the moment is inauspicious for such initiatives. “These are extreme times. People are still processing the Hamas attack and the war in Gaza. People are in survival mode and thinking in black and white,” said Nadav Shofet, Standing Together’s lead community organiser in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. One slender reason for hope is sharp rise in volunteers since the war began, members of the NGO say. Since the Hamas attacks in southern Israel in October, which killed 1,200 people, mainly civilians, thousands have joined the organisation. During the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed about 18,000 people, mostly women and children, and destroyed swaths of the territory, more have come forward to work with the group. “People are looking for a solution … It might seem crazy now but it’s clear the only way out is peace,” said Shofet. Outside the community centre, overlooking a sweep of beach and the Mediterranean, the municipal authorities have hung a banner bearing the slogan: “Together, all Jaffa’s residents will get through this”. Inside, a menorah for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah stands alongside a Christmas tree. The combination of rain and rockets means about only six children have turned up for the crafts session organised by Standing Together. Orit Tammuz, a 65-year-old Jewish former dancer, had brought her granddaughter Amani. “For me, all this is a natural thing.","Around 3 o’clock, children run to a special community center. It is for both Arab and Jewish people. The activities are starting soon. But the children are running because of something else.

A few minutes before, sirens sounded loudly. The sirens warned everyone about a rocket attack. The rockets were coming to Tel Aviv and Jaffa. Some children cried because they were scared. The metal doors of the center closed quickly.

Ten minutes later, two loud explosions happened. The rockets from Gaza were destroyed in the air. After that, the children left the smelly basement of the center. They went to their classes. There was gym class, music lessons, and crafts.

A group called Standing Together organized the crafts. They want to help Jewish and Arab people in Israel to get along better. But it is hard now because there has been a war for 11 weeks.

Even the people who work for Standing Together know it is a difficult time. Nadav Shofet works for Standing Together in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. He said people are still thinking about the Hamas attack and the war in Gaza. He said people are scared and only see things as good or bad.

However, there is some hope. More people are volunteering to help since the war started. After the Hamas attacks in October, many people joined the group. The attacks killed 1,200 people, mostly normal people.

The Israeli army attacked Gaza. About 18,000 people have died, mostly women and children. Many buildings were destroyed. More people have joined Standing Together to help.

Nadav Shofet said people want to find a solution. He said that peace is the only way out.

Outside the community center, there is a view of the beach and the sea. The city put up a sign. It says that everyone in Jaffa will get through this together.

Inside, there is a Hanukkah menorah and a Christmas tree. It is raining and there are rockets, so only six children came to the crafts session.

Orit Tammuz is 65 years old. She used to be a dancer. She is Jewish and brought her granddaughter Amani. Orit said that she thinks this is normal."
46,46_1,1,"Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Jews, in our family we don’t make a difference. There is no victory if this is not a country for all of us,” she said. Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise 21% of the population, often living in cities where they are a majority. Jaffa, with its mixed community, has attracted many young Jewish families in recent years, many with progressive views who feel out of step with the rightwards trend of Israeli society in general. This has led to sharp increases in property prices, which have forced out often poorer Arab residents. Tammuz admitted that neither Jaffa nor the crafts class was very representative of Israel, particularly at the moment. “Here, this is like being in a small bubble but we hope it will become bigger, or I don’t see any solution,” she said. Other activities run by Standing Together include food distributions to families experiencing economic hardship, renovating public bomb shelters and a series of well-attended rallies. The organisation, founded in 2016, has also set up an unarmed joint Arab-Jewish “civil guard” to protect all communities and alert police in the event of violence. The goal of many efforts was simply to bring members of different communities together, said Amir Badran, an organiser in Jaffa for Standing Together and a local politician and lawyer. This includes the popular children’s craft sessions, held every week for two months. “Although people are in big distress, they would still prefer to get together … We don’t want the kids to be afraid of each other and hate each other. Here, they get to know each other and the parents get to meet,” Badran said. Quite how difficult finding the common ground that Standing Together seeks is clear to almost everyone in Israel. The government is the most rightwing in the country’s history, including politicians accused of “inflammatory rhetoric” before the current conflict. Though there have been no major outbreaks of violence, relations between the Jewish majority and citizens who are Arab, many of whom now identify as Palestinian citizens of Israel, are tense. “At times of war people become more radical, and [the right] is using this war to incite against Palestinian citizens,” said Rula Daood, Standing Together’s co-director.","""In our family, we don't care if you are Arab, Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. This country must be good for everyone,"" she said.

Palestinians who are citizens of Israel are 21% of the people in the country. They often live in cities where most people are also Palestinian.

Jaffa is a city where Arabs and Jewish people live together. Many young Jewish families have moved to Jaffa. They have new ideas and don't agree with the more conservative views in Israel.

Because of this, houses in Jaffa have become very expensive. Many Arab people who don't have much money have been forced to leave.

Tammuz said that Jaffa and the crafts class are not like most of Israel right now. ""This is like a small, safe space. We hope it will grow, or I don't see a good future,"" she said.

The group ""Standing Together"" does other things too. They give food to families who are poor. They fix up bomb shelters. They also hold many public meetings.

This group started in 2016. They have created a group of Arab and Jewish people who work together. They are like a security team that does not use weapons. They protect everyone and tell the police if there is violence.

Amir Badran works for ""Standing Together"" in Jaffa. He is also a local politician and a lawyer. He said that many of their projects try to bring different groups of people together.

One example is the children's crafts sessions. They happen every week for two months. ""People are having a hard time, but they still want to be together. We don't want the children to be scared of each other or hate each other. Here, they meet each other, and their parents meet too,"" Badran said.

It is very hard to find common ground in Israel. Almost everyone knows this.

The government is now the most conservative it has ever been. Some politicians have been accused of saying things that make people angry before the current problems.

There has not been a lot of violence. But the relationship between Jewish people and Arab citizens is not good. Many Arab citizens now think of themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel.

""When there is war, people become more extreme. Some people are using this war to cause trouble for Palestinian citizens,"" said Rula Daood. She is a leader of ""Standing Together."""
46,46_2,2,"“Whether you are a regular, public or political figure, if you say anything that isn’t a call for revenge or wiping out Gaza, you are seen as part of the enemy now. Writing ‘May God have mercy on Gaza, children in Gaza’ – that’s enough to get you targeted.” Since the attacks on 7 October, a series of prominent Arab Israelis have been arrested. In October, the singer Dalal Abu Amneh was arrested briefly after posting “there is no victor but Allah” alongside a Palestinian flag on Facebook. Some of the community’s most prominent political leaders were held after planning an anti-war protest. Standing Together has set up a hotline “to give people a place, Palestinian or Jews, to turn to” if they are being harassed. A recent poll found nearly 60% of Arab Israelis were afraid of being harassed and 10% had personal experience of harassment. Daood said: “This is a real setback in Israeli society, especially Jewish society. The pain people are living in and the terror they have had since 7 October … It has basically blinded people and people are beginning to lose their own humanity. “We have had so many bad moments, maybe this is the most traumatic, but we have been able to rise up after each and every incident before. We are trying to show there is still another path and another way.” Among the people watching the children making finger puppets and posters in Jaffa was Vera Deek, an Arab Christian former teacher. “We believe in coexistence … that’s why I brought my daughter here. But [the problem] is not with the children,” Deek said. “It’s very difficult to be here, trying to live a normal life, when so many people have died or are still dying.” Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost friends and relatives in Gaza but also in the attacks on 7 October. Some of the first deaths reported were four people who died when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a Bedouin village in the Negev desert. Arab Israelis responding to the ground offensive, including paramedics, were also killed by Hamas. The Negev’s Bedouin tribes were some of the first to organise volunteer teams to search for missing Israelis.","It is a difficult time for everyone. If you are a famous person, you must be careful what you say. If you don't say you want revenge, people may think you are the enemy. Even saying ""God help the children in Gaza"" can cause problems.

Since October 7th, some Arab citizens of Israel have been arrested. A singer, Dalal Abu Amneh, was arrested for a short time. She posted a message with a Palestinian flag on Facebook. The message said, ""Only God wins."" Some political leaders were also arrested after planning a protest against the war.

An organization called Standing Together has created a special phone line. People who are being bothered can call this line for help. Both Jewish and Palestinian people can use this service. A recent survey showed that many Arab Israelis are scared. About 60% are afraid of being harassed. 10% have been harassed before.

Daood said that things are getting worse in Israel. He said that the pain and fear since October 7th have made people lose their humanity. He hopes that things will get better. He believes that there is still a way to find peace.

Vera Deek is an Arab Christian and used to be a teacher. She watched children making art in Jaffa. She believes that people can live together peacefully. She brought her daughter to the event to show this. But she said it is hard to live a normal life. So many people have died.

Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost people they know. Some died in Gaza. Others died in the attacks on October 7th. Some of the first people who died were from a Bedouin village in the Negev desert. They were killed by a rocket from Gaza. Some Arab Israelis, like paramedics, have also been killed by Hamas while helping people. The Bedouin tribes in the Negev were the first to help find missing Israelis. They organized groups to search for them."

Suddenly, she heard loud noises. They sounded like a building site. But they were similar to the rockets she heard earlier. She said she was worried about her son. He was playing football in a park close by. Deek also said something important. ""Arabs and Jews need to live together,"" she explained. ""Normal people are not the problem."""
47,47_0,0,"There was a familiar sense of misery for many travellers in the week before Christmas as hundreds of trains were cancelled, motorways were closed and ferry passengers queued for miles waiting to board their ships. But it doesn’t have to be this way, transport campaigners say, as politicians and transport bosses have the power to ease some of the problems facing travellers. There is more gloom to come in the short term, according to the RAC, with Boxing Day traffic surging, and the prospect of dangerous winds in Scotland and northern England. Around 21 million people drove to visit family or friends before Christmas, and thousands more took flights or trains as what has become known as the great Christmas getaway gained momentum. Storm Pia caused disruption to rail and road in Scotland and northern England on Wednesday. Eurostar workers in France took industrial action the following day, and the knock-on effect was huge demand for ferry services. Motorists queued for 90 minutes during peak times. Saturday was expected to be the busiest day of the year on the roads, according to the RAC and Inrix, with 20% more car journeys than last Christmas weekend. On Boxing Day they expect drivers on the M25 to face 50-minute delays, and on 27 December journeys in busy areas of the UK will be 25% longer. On Saturday Port of Dover Travel reported a 90-minute wait at French border controls as traffic built up after a surge in ferry bookings in the wake of Thursday’s Eurotunnel disruption. And the Met Office is warning of high winds in Scotland, northern England and north Wales today, with possible power cuts and flying debris. Even though the weather may be out of the control of ministers and rail chiefs, they have other ways of easing the burden on travellers, according to the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and the Clean Cities Campaign (CCC). National Highways removed 1,000 miles of roadworks on 19 December – “an early Christmas present” for drivers during the festive getaway. They will be back on 2 January. Widespread engineering works are planned for the rail network, although Network Rail said it was carrying out less work than usual, and no trains run on Christmas Day. In London, Paddington station is shut until Wednesday for HS2 works, while King’s Cross is shut today and Victoria station is not running Southeastern services until 2 January.","Many people who wanted to travel before Christmas were sad. Many trains were stopped. Roads were closed. People waited a long time to get on ferries.

Some people who try to make travel better say it does not have to be so bad. They say people in charge can help.

The RAC says things will be bad soon. There will be a lot of traffic on Boxing Day. There may be strong winds in Scotland and the north of England.

About 21 million people drove to see family or friends before Christmas. Many more people took planes or trains. This is called the ""great Christmas getaway.""

Storm Pia made problems for trains and roads in Scotland and the north of England on Wednesday.

Workers in France who work for Eurostar went on strike on Thursday. This made more people want to use ferries. Cars waited for 90 minutes at the busiest times.

The RAC and Inrix said Saturday would be the busiest day for roads this year. They said there would be 20% more cars than last Christmas weekend.

They think people on the M25 road will wait 50 minutes on Boxing Day. On December 27, trips in busy places in the UK will take 25% longer.

On Saturday, the Port of Dover said people waited 90 minutes at the French border. This was because more people wanted to use ferries after the problems with Eurotunnel on Thursday.

The Met Office says there will be strong winds in Scotland, the north of England, and north Wales today. This could cause power cuts and things blowing around.

The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and the Clean Cities Campaign (CCC) say the weather is hard to control. But they say people in charge can still help travelers in other ways.

National Highways took away 1,000 miles of road work on December 19. They called it a Christmas gift for drivers. The road work will start again on January 2.

There will be a lot of work on the train tracks. Network Rail said they will do less work than usual. No trains will run on Christmas Day.

Paddington station in London is closed until Wednesday. This is for work on HS2. King's Cross is closed today. Victoria station will not have Southeastern trains until January 2."
47,47_1,1,"And passengers will be gambling with services by operators such as Avanti West Coast, which cut services in December and has seen 32% of services cancelled or severely delayed. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” said Michael Solomon Williams, CBT campaigns manager. “It’s not rational any more to distinguish between commuter travel and leisure travel.” Since the pandemic, fewer people travel during the week, he said. “People work weekends, go to football matches. There are all sorts of reasons why we need more services at weekends and Christmas, when people travel around the country more than any other time. “Another time makes more sense, like the second week of January, or on a Monday, for example.” He added that another balm for travellers would be the creation of Great British Railways, announced by the government in May 2021 but mothballed in October 2022. And passengers are being told to pay an extra 4.9% on rail fares in the new year. “They could have frozen fares the way they have with fuel duty for the last 13 years,” Solomon Williams said. “The cost of travelling by train has gone up at twice the rate of driving.” Oliver Lord, head of CCC, said that disrupting services on the busiest travel days of the year meant people were more likely to choose to take the car, adding to congestion. “A third of rail use now is on leisure,” he said. “If the three or four times a year a family wants to use trains to get out of town, and their experience is engineering works, a rail replacement bus service and journeys that take three times as long, what will they think? “It’s a great opportunity for the government to make a strategic decision,” Lord added. “If we said the first week or two of January was a time when businesses and corporations could do things a bit differently, with more working from home, that would be a great new year’s resolution from the government.” Travellers who have faced cancellations or delays should make sure they claim compensation, said Naomi Leach, deputy editor of Which? Travel. “Sadly, it seems as though serious travel disruption over the festive period is becoming increasingly commonplace, with travellers once again facing the misery of cancelled trains as they try to make it home in time for Christmas,” she said.","People who use trains may have problems. Train companies like Avanti West Coast are not running enough trains. Avanti West Coast cut back on trains in December. Many of their trains, about 32%, are late or cancelled.

Michael Solomon Williams works for CBT. He thinks this is not good. He says it is not smart to only think about people who use trains to go to work. Now, fewer people travel to work during the week because of the pandemic. People travel at other times too, like weekends. They go to football games or travel for fun. We need more trains on weekends and at Christmas. This is when many people travel.

He thinks that some times are better for less trains. For example, the second week of January or on Mondays.

He also said that Great British Railways would help. The government talked about it in 2021. But they stopped working on it in 2022.

Train tickets will also cost more next year. They will go up by 4.9%. The government could have kept the prices the same. They have done that with fuel for cars for many years. Train tickets have become much more expensive than driving.

Oliver Lord works for CCC. He says that when trains are not running on busy days, people will drive cars instead. This makes traffic worse. He says that many people, about a third, use trains for fun. If families have problems with trains, they will not want to use them. For example, if the trains are being fixed, they might take a bus instead. The trip will take much longer.

He thinks the government should make a smart decision. He suggests that businesses let people work from home for the first two weeks of January.

Naomi Leach works for Which? Travel. She says that people who have problems with trains should ask for money back. She says that train problems at Christmas are becoming normal. People are sad when their trains are cancelled when they want to go home for Christmas."

The UK Health Security Agency said the death “has been associated with this outbreak” and added later that it occurred in Scotland, but was unable to provide more information about the case. The agency said that as of 27 December there had been 30 confirmed cases in England and Scotland linked to an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), which first emerged in July. The cases involved children as young as seven and those aged up to 81, and most cases had occurred in December. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland announced a precautionary recall of four cheeses made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese on Christmas Eve due to possible E coli contamination. It added a fifth product, which is sold by Waitrose, to the recall list on 27 December. “Epidemiological and food chain investigations have identified links between some of the identified cases and a number of unpasteurised cheeses produced by a business in England,” the agency said. “UKHSA is continuing to follow up cases to identify any common links, including determining whether cases ate or came into contact with the recalled cheeses.” The products affected by the recall are: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild &amp; Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese. Amy Douglas, the agency’s incident director for gastrointestinal infections and food safety division, urged people who suspected they may have been infected not to travel over the holiday season. “There have been at least 30 confirmed cases of this specific outbreak strain of Stec in the UK,” she said. “Symptoms of Stec include severe diarrhoea (including bloody diarrhoea), stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing it on to family and friends over the festive period.","Someone in Scotland has died. They were sick with E coli. It seems like this is the first death from an E coli problem. At least 30 people are sick with this E coli.

The UK Health Security Agency said the death is linked to the E coli problem. The death happened in Scotland. The agency could not give more details.

The agency said that on December 27th, there were 30 people with E coli. These people were in England and Scotland. The E coli is called Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec). It started in July.

Some sick people are children, as young as seven. Other sick people are old, up to 81 years old. Most people got sick in December.

The Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland said something about cheese. They said people should not eat some cheeses. The cheeses are made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese. This happened on Christmas Eve because the cheese might have E coli.

They added another cheese to the list on December 27th. This cheese is sold by Waitrose.

The agency said they found a connection. Some sick people ate cheese from a business in England. The cheese was not heated to kill germs.

The UKHSA is still checking the cases. They want to find out how people got sick. They want to know if the sick people ate the cheese that was recalled.

These are the cheeses that people should not eat: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild & Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese.

Amy Douglas works for the agency. She is in charge of food safety. She said that if people think they are sick, they should not travel. This is especially important during the holidays.

She said that at least 30 people have this E coli. The E coli is a special type of Stec.

Stec can make you very sick. You might have bad diarrhea, sometimes with blood. You might have stomach pain, throw up, and have a fever. If you have diarrhea and are throwing up, be careful. You can spread it to your family and friends. Try not to spread it during the holidays."

49,49_0,0,"The Middle East has been slipping towards the precipice of a regional war ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and the ferocious Israeli response in Gaza. The past week has shown how the cliff edge keeping it from that abyss could quickly crumble away. Within hours of the outbreak of the Gaza war, the Hezbollah Shia militia in Lebanon began to fire on northern Israeli towns and villages in solidarity with Palestinians, triggering Israeli air strikes in response, and Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea with real or perceived Israeli connections. The US moved two aircraft carriers and their accompanying strike groups to the region as American bases in Syria and Iraq came under repeated attacks from Iran-affiliated groups, drawing swift retaliation from Washington. At the same time the West Bank erupted in protests at the bombing of civilians in Gaza and extremist Jewish settlers quickly sought to ride the wave of Israeli anger by seizing Palestinian land and terrorising its residents. Each of these theatres of conflict has the potential to ignite a much-feared Middle East conflagration, and the past few days have demonstrated just how easily escalation, intended or not, could bring Israel into open confrontation with Iran, and suck in the US too. An Israeli airstrike just outside Damascus killed a senior figure in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Sayyed Razi Mousavi, who was responsible for military liaison between Syria and Iran. After Mousavi’s death last Monday, the IRGC issued a statement declaring the “usurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime”. Tehran’s Houthi allies have meanwhile have been firing on the US-led “Prosperity Guardian” naval task force assembled to protect shipping in the Red Sea. American warships shot down dozens of drones and also a handful of ballistic missiles. US Central Command issued a statement to say that Washington had “every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran”.","Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, the Middle East has become more dangerous. Israel's response in Gaza made things worse. It looks like a regional war could happen.

Last week showed that the situation could quickly get much worse.

Soon after the war in Gaza started, Hezbollah began to attack northern Israel. Hezbollah is a Shia group in Lebanon. They did this to support the Palestinians. Israel then attacked back with airstrikes.

Also, the Houthi group in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea. They thought these ships were connected to Israel.

The US moved two aircraft carriers to the area. American bases in Syria and Iraq were attacked by groups linked to Iran. The US quickly responded with its own attacks.

At the same time, people in the West Bank protested the bombing of civilians in Gaza. Some Jewish settlers tried to take advantage of the situation. They tried to take Palestinian land and scare the people living there.

Each of these conflicts could start a bigger war in the Middle East. The last few days showed how easily things could get out of control. Israel could end up fighting Iran directly. The US could also get involved.

Israel attacked near Damascus and killed Sayyed Razi Mousavi. He was an important person in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He helped with military communication between Syria and Iran.

After Mousavi died, the IRGC said that Israel will pay for this. They called Israel the ""usurper and savage Zionist regime.""

Iran's allies, the Houthis, have been attacking the US-led ""Prosperity Guardian"" naval group. This group is protecting ships in the Red Sea. American warships shot down many drones and some missiles.

US Central Command said that they think Iran is helping the Houthis with these attacks. The attacks are launched by the Houthis in Yemen, but Iran is enabling them."
49,49_1,1,"If a US warship is struck, Joe Biden would be under intense pressure to deliver a decisive response, as he enters an election year with his tenure hanging in the balance and Republicans looking to focus on any trace of weakness. On Thursday, a former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, wrote a commentary in a US newspaper expressing the view of many on the hawkish end of the security establishments in both the Israel and the US that they are doomed to fight Iranian proxies indefinitely until Iran is taken on directly. “The evil empire of Iran must be brought down,” Bennett argued in the Wall Street Journal. “The US and Israel must set the clear goal of bringing down Iran’s evil regime. Not only is this possible. It is vital for the safety and security of the Middle East – and the entire civilised world.” On Friday, the UN security council convened to discuss violence on the West Bank, but the session was quickly drawn into a discussion of a regional war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, dismissed the issue of settler violence in the West Bank as a distraction from the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon. “The situation in northern Israel is reaching a point of no return,” Erdan said, echoing an increasingly frequent warning from Israeli officials that their country would take matters into its own hands, possibly by carving out a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. “If these attacks continue, I reiterate the situation will escalate and may lead to a full-scale war. Lebanon must be held accountable for the aggression carried out from its territory,” the Israeli envoy said. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, a UN assistant secretary-general, told security council members that, while most of the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been around the border, some strikes were going deeper into each other’s territory, “raising the spectre of an uncontained conflict with devastating consequences for the people of both countries”. Khiari added that “the risk of miscalculation and further escalation is increasing as the conflict in Gaza continues”.","If a US ship is attacked, President Biden will have a problem. People will want him to react strongly. It is an election year. His job could be at risk. Republicans will try to show he is weak.

Naftali Bennett, a former leader of Israel, wrote an article. He said that Israel and the US must fight groups that Iran supports. He thinks this fight will never end unless they fight Iran directly.

Bennett said that Iran is a bad country. He said the US and Israel need to stop Iran from being so powerful. He said this is important for safety in the Middle East and the world.

The UN talked about violence in the West Bank. But the talk quickly changed to a bigger war in the area.

The Israeli ambassador said that the violence in the West Bank is not the real problem. He said that Hezbollah in Lebanon is the bigger danger. He said the situation in northern Israel is getting very bad.

Israeli officials often say they might take action themselves. They might create a safe area in southern Lebanon. The ambassador said that if the attacks continue, there could be a big war. He said Lebanon is responsible for the attacks from its land.

A UN leader, Mohamed Khaled Khiari, spoke to the UN. He said that Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting near the border. But some attacks are going further into each country. He said this could lead to a big war. This war would be very bad for both countries.

Khiari said that the war in Gaza makes things more dangerous. He said that mistakes could happen and the fighting could get worse."
49,49_2,2,"Lana Nusseibeh, the envoy of the United Arab Emirates, expressed the uneasiness of the Arab world that in the absence of “bold and perhaps uncomfortable decisions” to reverse the drift towards regional conflict, “the alternative is the hellscape of Gaza expanded into the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other parts of the Middle East”. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, the UN estimates that 304 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including 79 children, along with four Israelis, three of them soldiers. Four more Israelis were killed in West Jerusalem in an attack by Palestinian gunmen on 30 November. One of the dead was mistakenly shot by an Israeli soldier. The disproportionate number of Palestinian dead showed that Israeli forces have been conducting an overkill campaign in an effort to deter an uprising in the West Bank in solidarity with Gaza, argued Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “The Israeli mindset is that they think they are preventing a third Intifada,” Elgindy said. “But I think the way they’re operating, they’re probably more like causing one.” He pointed to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as a particularly volatile element in the combustible state of the region. Overwhelmingly blamed by Israelis for the security lapses that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, Netanyahu faces a fall from power, but only when the fighting ends, or at least lessens in intensity. An escalation, on the other hand, could keep him in his post. “It is Netanyahu, frankly, who is dictating the terms on all fronts – in Gaza, on the Lebanon border, across the region – for Netanyahu’s reasons. This is his war,” Elgindy said. He added: “ I think every day that this goes on, you get closer to regional expansion of this whole mess.”","Lana Nusseibeh is from the United Arab Emirates. She talked about the problems in the Arab world. She said that leaders need to make important decisions. These decisions might be hard, but they are needed. If they don't make these decisions, the problems will get worse. The problems in Gaza could spread to other places. This includes the West Bank, Israel, and Lebanon. It could affect other countries in the Middle East too.

Since October 7th, Hamas attacked Israel. After this attack, many people have died. The United Nations says that 304 Palestinians have died in the West Bank. 79 of them were children. Also, four Israelis have died. Three of them were soldiers. On November 30th, four more Israelis died in Jerusalem. Palestinian men with guns attacked them. One of the Israelis was killed by mistake. An Israeli soldier shot him.

Khaled Elgindy works at the Middle East Institute. He said that many more Palestinians have died than Israelis. He thinks Israeli soldiers are using too much force. They are trying to stop Palestinians in the West Bank from fighting. The Palestinians might want to help people in Gaza.

Elgindy said that Israel wants to stop a new Intifada. An Intifada is when Palestinians fight against Israel. But Elgindy thinks Israel's actions are making things worse. He believes they might cause a new Intifada.

Elgindy also talked about Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu is the leader of Israel. Elgindy thinks Netanyahu is making the area more dangerous. Many Israelis think Netanyahu made mistakes. They think he did not protect Israel well enough before the Hamas attack. Because of this, he might lose his job. But he will only lose his job after the fighting stops or gets better. If the fighting gets worse, he might stay in charge.

Elgindy said that Netanyahu is in control of everything. He is in control in Gaza, on the border with Lebanon, and in other places. Elgindy said that this is ""Netanyahu's war.""

Elgindy also said that every day the fighting continues, the problems get closer to spreading to other countries in the area."

The corruption investigation office confirmed that a court in Seoul had approved the warrant, but it was not clear if police would be able to execute it. “The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol … were issued this morning,” the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for Yoon, condemned the move. “The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid,” he said in a statement. Soon after investigators said they had raided the army’s counterintelligence offices as part of the growing martial law probe. “The emergency martial law investigation team of the Corruption Investigation Office is conducting a search and seizure operation at the Counterintelligence Command this afternoon,” investigators said in a statement. Yoon has so far refused to cooperate with the investigation into his martial law order. He has failed to report to investigators for questioning over allegations of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion, and his presidential security service has prevented court-ordered searches of his office and residence. Yoon also faces charges of insurrection – a crime that can carry life imprisonment or the death penalty and one of the few charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. An official from the corruption investigation office said Yoon’s refusal to be questioned had prompted the warrant request. “The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime,” the official said. The warrant is valid until 6 January, he said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.","A court in South Korea said yes to arresting the country's president. The president is Yoon Suk Yeol. He was stopped from doing his job before because of a problem.

Investigators said that Yoon made a bad choice. He wanted to use the army to control the country earlier this month. This is called martial law.

Yoon said he wanted martial law on December 3. This made things very bad for South Korea. It is a big country in Asia. It caused problems with other countries too, like the United States.

Yoon had to stop the martial law. He only used it for six hours. Members of parliament went into the building. They voted against it.

The corruption office said the court in Seoul agreed to the arrest. But it is not sure if the police can arrest him.

The investigation team said the court gave them permission to arrest President Yoon. They also can search his things.

Yoon's lawyer, Yoon Kab-keun, is angry. He said the arrest is wrong. He said they cannot arrest him because the group asking for it does not have the power to investigate.

Investigators also said they searched the army's offices. This is because of the investigation into the martial law.

The investigators are looking into the emergency martial law. They searched the Counterintelligence Command office this afternoon.

Yoon has not helped with the investigation. He has not answered questions about the martial law. He did not go to the investigators when they asked him. They wanted to ask about using his power wrongly. They also wanted to ask about planning a rebellion. His security stopped the court from searching his office and home.

Yoon might be charged with rebellion. This is a very serious crime. He could go to jail for life or be killed. Presidents in South Korea usually cannot be charged with crimes, but this is one crime they can be charged with.

An official from the corruption office said Yoon did not answer questions. That is why they asked for the arrest warrant.

The official said they think Yoon will not come when they ask him. They think he did something wrong.

The arrest warrant is good until January 6. Yoon could be held at a police station or a jail in Seoul."
50,50_1,1,"Media reports said an imminent arrest or search of the presidential residence was unlikely, as investigators would seek to coordinate with the presidential security service. Technically, anyone obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant could be arrested. But under South Korean law, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it is unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces arrest. It is the first time an arrest warrant has been issued for an incumbent president in South Korea, according to local media. Police were deployed early on Tuesday outside Yoon’s residence in central Seoul in an attempt to prevent unrest. Yoon’s supporters and protesters calling for his removal have staked out his residence, with local media showing images of altercations between the two camps overnight. “Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?” Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon’s residence to show they were doing their work diligently and fairly. Park Sung-min, president of the Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant was probably an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with the investigation. The acting leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power party, Kweon Seong-dong, said on Tuesday that attempting to detain a sitting president was inappropriate, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the national assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December over his imposition of martial law. The constitutional court has 180 days from that date to decide whether to confirm the impeachment or reinstate Yoon, whose two-and-a-half years in office have been marred by scandal and policy deadlock. The martial law order triggered weeks of political and market turmoil. Yoon’s replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week for refusing to approve bills to facilitate the investigation into his predecessor.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

News reports say that the president will probably not be arrested soon. His house will probably not be searched now. Investigators want to talk to the president's security team first.

It is against the law to stop someone from being arrested. But, some places have special rules in South Korea. If a place has military secrets, it cannot be searched without permission. The person in charge must agree to the search. It is not likely that President Yoon will leave his house if he might be arrested.

This is the first time a president in South Korea might be arrested. Police officers were outside President Yoon's house on Tuesday. They wanted to stop any problems.

People who support President Yoon were there. Other people who want him to leave office were also there. News pictures show they were fighting during the night.

Choi Jin is the head of a group in Seoul. He studies presidents. He said that President Yoon must agree to be arrested. If he does not agree, there is no way to arrest him. Choi Jin asked if the investigators will fight with the security team.

Choi Jin thinks the investigators will visit President Yoon's house. They want to show they are doing their job. They want to show they are being fair.

Park Sung-min works for a company that gives advice about politics. He thinks the arrest warrant is to make President Yoon work with the investigation.

Kweon Seong-dong is a leader in President Yoon's party. He said that trying to arrest a president is not right.

President Yoon's power has been stopped for now. The National Assembly voted to impeach him on December 14. This was because he ordered martial law.

The Constitutional Court has 180 days to decide what to do. They can agree with the impeachment. Or, they can let President Yoon be president again. President Yoon has been president for two and a half years. There have been problems during this time. There have been scandals and problems with making new laws.

The martial law order made problems for weeks. The stock market was also not stable. Han Duck-soo is now the acting president. He was also impeached last week. This was because he did not approve bills to help the investigation of President Yoon."
50,50_2,2,"Han’s successor as interim president, Choi Sang-mok, had been in office for just two days when he was confronted with the fatal plane crash at Muan international airport, the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil. On Tuesday Choi called for national harmony and unity and for trust in the government in a New Year’s address. “The Republic of Korea is in an unprecedentedly serious situation,” Choi said in a written statement, citing changes around global trade, diplomacy and security, as well as domestic political uncertainty. “The government will do its best to run state affairs stably in all areas of defence, diplomacy, economy and society for the people to feel relieved,” he added. Agencies contributed reporting","Choi Sang-mok became the new president. He replaced Han. Choi had only been president for two days. Then, something bad happened.

A plane crashed at Muan airport. Many people died. It was the worst plane crash in South Korea. This happened very soon after Choi became president.

On Tuesday, Choi spoke to the country. It was a New Year’s message. He said that everyone in South Korea should work together. He also said people should trust the government.

Choi said South Korea is facing big problems. He wrote a statement about this. He talked about changes in how countries trade and work together. He also mentioned problems with safety and security. He also said there were political problems in South Korea.

Choi said the government will work hard. They will try to keep the country stable. This includes things like defense, talking to other countries, the economy, and taking care of people. He wants people to feel safe and calm."
51,51_0,0,"In the wake of the April 2019 fire that devastated Notre Dame, the French president Emmanuel Macron promised that the monument would be rebuilt with a “contemporary gesture”. There followed all manner of madcap ideas: a glass spire; a 300ft carbon-fibre flame; a swimming pool on the roof; a covered garden. In the end, Notre Dame was restored to its original former glory and ceremonially reopened this month. Now, however, the planned “contemporary gesture” has been revealed – and has sparked a bitter row. The French artist Claire Tabouret has been chosen to design new stained glass windows depicting Pentecostal scenes, to be installed in the chapels on the south side of the medieval church. Tabouret was among 100 artists who took part in a competition to replace the existing six windows installed by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in 1844 – even though the windows were not damaged in the 2019 fire. Designs submitted by Tabouret, 43, a figurative artist whose work featured in the Vatican pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year and who now lives in Los Angeles, show scenes of people in prayer in shades of red, turquoise, yellow and pink. She will work with master glassmakers at the Atelier Simon-Marq, a glass workshop founded in Reims in 1640, to recreate the drawings in glass. The plan to replace the 19th-century chapel windows, which feature geometric designs described as having more historic than aesthetic value, has enraged critics. The 1964 Venice Charter, which codifies guidelines for preserving French buildings, states: “Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation,” and that “the valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected”. In July, the national committee for heritage and architecture at France’s ministry of culture unanimously opposed the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows, prompting one artist to withdraw his designs from the competition. The Académie des Beaux-Arts has also opposed the replacing of the windows.","In April 2019, there was a big fire at Notre Dame. The fire caused a lot of damage. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the building would be fixed. He also wanted to add something new and modern.

People had many ideas for this new part. Some wanted a glass tower. Others wanted a big flame made of special material. Someone even suggested a swimming pool on the roof! Another idea was a garden with a roof.

In the end, Notre Dame was fixed to look like it did before. It opened again this month. Now, we know what the ""new and modern"" part will be. It is causing a lot of arguments.

A French artist named Claire Tabouret will design new windows. These windows will show scenes from Pentecost. They will be put in the small rooms on the south side of the church. This part of the church is very old.

Tabouret was one of many artists. They all entered a contest to design the new windows. The old windows were made in 1844 by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. These windows were not broken in the fire.

Tabouret is 43 years old. She makes art that shows people and things. Her art was shown at the Vatican in Venice. She lives in Los Angeles now. Her window designs show people praying. The colors are red, blue-green, yellow, and pink.

Tabouret will work with skilled glassmakers. They work at a place called Atelier Simon-Marq. This workshop started in 1640. They will make the drawings into real glass windows.

Some people are angry about the plan. They do not want to replace the old windows. These windows were made in the 1800s. They have shapes, not pictures. Some say they are important for history, but not very beautiful.

There are rules for taking care of old buildings in France. These rules say that things like sculptures or paintings should only be removed if it is the only way to save them. The rules also say we should respect all the things that were added to a building over time.

In July, a group of experts said no to the plan. They did not want to remove the old windows. One artist even took his designs out of the contest because of this. The Académie des Beaux-Arts also does not want to replace the windows."
51,51_1,1,"In a statement last year, it wrote: “[The members of the academy] are concerned that the announcement of a competition for the creation of contemporary stained glass windows, which they support in principle, involves replacing the non-figurative windows ... The fire spared these windows. “The Académie des Beaux-Arts hopes that other locations, starting with the North Tower, will be considered for this commission for contemporary stained glass.” However, the plan, expected to cost more than €4m (£3.3m), has the approval of the president, the archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, and the church authorities. At a press conference after the announcement of her selection, Tabouret, a graduate of Paris’s prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, said she was “excited” by the challenge but aware of the controversy. “I’ve read about the different opinions of people because I want to understand their arguments and also to take an approach that is open and two-way. I find it a fascinating debate,” she said. She wanted to create stained glass windows that would have “the right presence … without imposing themselves on visitors”. Didier Rykner, a French journalist, art historian and founder of La Tribune de l’Art, a magazine dedicated to preserving France’s heritage, has described the idea of replacing the windows as “totally ludicrous”. He has launched a petition against the plan that has almost 250,000 signatures. “The president of the republic has decided on his own, without any regard for the heritage law or Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, to replace the stained glass windows in six out of the seven chapels on the south aisle with contemporary creations, after organising a competition,” it reads. “The stained glass windows in Notre Dame designed by Viollet-le-Duc were created as a coherent whole. It is a genuine creation that the architect wanted to be faithful to the cathedral’s gothic origins. Who gave the head of state a mandate to alter a cathedral that does not belong to him, but to everyone? “Emmanuel Macron wants to put the stamp of the 21st century on Notre Dame de Paris.","The Académie des Beaux-Arts said something last year. They talked about a new contest. The contest is for new stained glass windows. The academy likes the idea of new windows. But they are worried.

The new windows might replace old ones. These old windows are not pictures of people. The fire did not damage these windows.

The Académie wants the new windows somewhere else. They think the North Tower would be a good place.

This plan will cost a lot of money. It will cost more than 4 million euros. The president agrees with the plan. The archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, agrees too. The church leaders also agree.

A woman named Tabouret won the contest. She went to a good school in Paris. It is called École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. She is happy about the challenge.

But she knows some people do not like the idea. She said she wants to understand everyone's opinion. She wants to talk to people about it. She thinks it is an interesting discussion.

She wants to make windows that are good. She wants them to be there, but not too noticeable. She does not want them to bother people who visit.

Didier Rykner is a journalist. He studies art history. He has a magazine about French history. It is called La Tribune de l’Art. He thinks the idea of replacing the windows is very bad.

He started a petition against the plan. Almost 250,000 people have signed it.

The petition says the president made this decision alone. He did not think about the rules about old buildings. He wants to replace the windows in six chapels. These chapels are on the south side. He wants new, modern windows.

The old windows were made by Viollet-le-Duc. He made them to fit together. They were made to look like the cathedral's old style.

The petition asks who gave the president permission. The cathedral belongs to everyone, not just him.

Emmanuel Macron wants to make Notre Dame look like it belongs in the 21st century."
51,51_2,2,"Perhaps a little modesty would be preferable.” The French heritage association Sites &amp; Monuments has threatened legal action if the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows goes ahead. Rykner told the Observer: “To remove windows that survived the fire undamaged and replace them with others is just absurd. I am not against contemporary windows per se but there is just no reason to replace these windows. Besides, money donated by people to renovate Notre Dame has already been spent on cleaning them. “It’s absolutely ridiculous. We’ve been told they will put the Viollet-le-Duc windows on display in a museum. They don’t belong in a museum – they belong in Notre Dame. It makes no sense for them to be on display anywhere other than the cathedral. Their only interest is in situ.” He added: “I don’t see why Macron has such a say over what happens to a heritage building. This is just a vanity project. “As for the church authorities approving this – we should remember that the greatest vandalism done to French churches and religious buildings in the 60s and 70s was carried out … by the church. They have no taste.” Stéphane Bern, Macron’s former heritage tsar, voiced his opposition to the plan in an interview with Ouest France newspaper. “I have nothing against Claire Tabouret or contemporary stained glass ... But I am in favour of them when the old ones are destroyed or damaged. You can’t remove stained glass windows that are listed as historic monuments,” Bern said. “Why does the state set itself free from the rules it imposes on others? Just because the president wants it that way?” Simon-Marq will make the six new windows, which will reach 7m high and cover a total surface area of 121 sq metres, and are expected to be installed in 2026. Tabouret said she would be incorporating motifs from Viollet-le-Duc’s windows in the stained glass.","Some people think the plan is not good. A group called Sites & Monuments is angry. They might take legal action. This is because the plan is to remove some windows.

Rykner spoke to a newspaper. He said it is silly to remove the windows. The windows were not broken in the fire. New windows will replace them. Rykner is not against new windows. But he thinks these old windows should stay. People gave money to fix Notre Dame. Some of that money was used to clean these windows.

Rykner thinks it is ridiculous. He heard the old windows will go to a museum. But he thinks they should stay in Notre Dame. They belong in the cathedral. He believes the only right place for them is in their original location.

He also said Macron has too much control. Macron is making it about himself, not the building. Rykner does not understand why Macron can decide about a very old building.

The church leaders agreed to the plan. But Rykner remembers something. In the past, the church damaged many old buildings. They did this in the 1960s and 1970s. He thinks they don't have good taste.

Stéphane Bern used to be in charge of old buildings for Macron. He also disagrees with the plan. He spoke to a newspaper called Ouest France.

Bern said he likes new stained glass. But only when the old ones are broken. These old windows are historical. You cannot just remove them. The government makes rules for everyone. But the government is breaking its own rules. Is it just because the President wants it?

Simon-Marq will make the new windows. The windows will be very big, 7 meters tall. They will cover 121 square meters. They should be ready in 2026.

Tabouret is the artist. She said she will use designs from the old windows. She will put these designs in the new stained glass."
52,52_0,0,"I was drawn to Jonathan Freedland’s article (‘How do we live in this terrible world?’ a reader asked me. Here’s the only answer I have, 20 December), as it is a question that’s continually on my mind. There’s much substance in his well-informed piece, though the ending’s quite simple and resonates with my own take: “Perhaps by accepting that it’s the only one we have and that it’s not always so terrible – that sometimes, even quite often, it can be rather beautiful.” One of my responses to this ever-present question is to have gratitude for what I call “magic moments” in nature – like this morning catching sight of the heron, almost invisible, being so amazingly camouflaged among the reeds by a stream; I said “good morning, heron” softly, but didn’t linger because I’ve come to realise that they don’t like being looked at for long. A few years ago, I made a book of Marvellous Mundane Magic for my then 10-year-old granddaughter, to demonstrate to her that magic wasn’t solely the property of wizards. She loved it and now she’s noting her own and giving them to me to make a new book. Even a short early-morning walk offers magic if your eyes and ears are open, even if it’s just hearing a winter robin or seeing herb robert still flowering by a path. Margaret Turner Exeter • Jonathan Freedland gave us “a few reasons to be hopeful” about living in this terrible world. Thank you – they are good reasons: drawing strength from those who “dare to swim against even the bleakest tides”, celebrating what is good, and remembering that this is the only world we have, and that it is often beautiful. These reasons all involve looking outwards, observing. A complementary way of being hopeful – and happy – is looking inwards and acting on our values. Alone, or with the help of activist citizen groups. Thinking back, that is what the suffragettes did, the anti-apartheid activists and many others who have made the world a better place.","I read an article by Jonathan Freedland. It was called ""How do we live in this terrible world?"" This question is always in my thoughts.

His article had good information. The end was simple. It said we should accept that this world is the only one we have. It also said the world is not always terrible. Sometimes, it is beautiful. I agree with this.

I often think about this question. I try to be thankful for ""magic moments"" in nature. For example, this morning I saw a heron. It was hiding in the reeds by a stream. It was hard to see. I said ""good morning"" to the heron. But I did not stay long. I know they do not like to be watched.

A few years ago, I made a book for my granddaughter. She was ten years old then. The book was about ""Marvellous Mundane Magic."" I wanted to show her that magic is not only for wizards. She liked the book very much. Now she finds her own magic moments. She gives them to me so I can make a new book.

Even a short walk in the morning can be magic. You just need to open your eyes and ears. You might hear a robin in winter. Or you might see a flower by the path.

Margaret Turner from Exeter wrote about Jonathan Freedland's article. She said he gave us reasons to be hopeful. He talked about living in this bad world. Thank you, Jonathan! His reasons were good. We can be strong by learning from people who fight against bad things. We can also celebrate good things. We should remember this is the only world we have. And it is often beautiful.

These reasons ask us to look outside ourselves. We need to watch the world. Another way to be hopeful is to look inside ourselves. We can act on what we believe is right. We can do this alone. Or we can join groups that help people.

I think about the women who fought for the right to vote. I also think about people who fought against apartheid. Many people have made the world a better place."

53,53_0,0,"As families in Taiwan prepare to gather for lunar new year celebrations in January, a game that will be released that month promises to offer some war-themed fun over the festive period. The board game 2045, developed by the Taiwanese company Mizo Games, invites players to participate in an imaginary Chinese invasion 20 years in the future. Players are given roles that include Taiwanese army officers, Chinese sleeper agents and volunteer citizen fighters. “We can’t predict the future, but if a conflict is unavoidable I hope this game gives people a chance to experience war on the tabletop before it reaches us,” KJ Chang, the founder of Mizo Games, told the Wall Street Journal. The game is being released at a time when China has increased its military pressure around the self-governing island. Taiwan has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China but Beijing regards it as part of its territory and has promised to “unify” it with China, using force if necessary. Observers do not know when, if ever, China will launch a military operation against Taiwan. But some analysts have pointed to the years around 2050 as a possible risk period. Xi Jinping, China’s leader and military commander-in-chief, has pledged to build a “world-class army” by the middle of the century, and 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic of China, is the date by which Beijing wants to achieve “national rejuvenation”. Mizo Games launched a crowdfunding campaign for their new product in August. Within months, it had raised NTD$4.1m (£99,468), surpassing its original target by more than 4,000%. 2045 is the latest in a series of entertainment products in Taiwan that focus on the threat of an attempted Chinese annexation. This year also saw the release of Zero Day, a Taiwanese government-funded television series that depicts a Chinese invasion. It also received support from Robert Tsao, a Taiwanese tech billionaire and supporter of Taiwan’s civil defence efforts. As well as receiving the first copies of the game, VIP backers of the crowdfunding campaign will receive extra Taiwan-themed products.","In January, families in Taiwan will celebrate the Lunar New Year. A new game will also come out that month. It is about war.

The game is called 2045. A company in Taiwan, Mizo Games, made it. In the game, players pretend there is a Chinese invasion in 20 years.

Players can be different people. They can be soldiers from Taiwan. They can be Chinese spies. Or they can be regular people who want to fight.

KJ Chang started Mizo Games. He said we don't know what will happen in the future. But he hopes the game lets people understand war. They can experience it in a game before it happens in real life.

China is putting more military pressure on Taiwan now. Taiwan governs itself. But China thinks Taiwan is part of China. China wants to join Taiwan to China. They might even use force.

People are not sure when China will attack Taiwan. Some people think it could happen around the year 2050.

The leader of China, Xi Jinping, wants a very strong army by then. In 2049, China will celebrate 100 years. China wants to be strong and successful by then.

Mizo Games asked people for money to make the game. They started in August. In a few months, they got a lot of money. They got more than they asked for.

2045 is not the only thing in Taiwan about a possible Chinese invasion. This year, there was also a TV show called Zero Day. The government helped pay for it. It showed a Chinese invasion.

Robert Tsao also helped. He is a rich person who supports Taiwan.

People who gave a lot of money to the game will get the game first. They will also get other gifts about Taiwan."

54,54_0,0,"The tech entrepreneur and close adviser to Donald Trump Elon Musk has taken a stunning new public step in his support for the far-right German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), publishing a supportive guest opinion piece for the country’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that has prompted the commentary editor to resign in protest. The commentary piece in German was launched online on Saturday before being published on Sunday in the flagship paper of the Axel Springer media group, which also owns the US politics news site Politico. Musk uses populist and personal language to try to deny AfD’s extremist bent, and the essay expands on his post on his social media platform, X, on which he last week claimed that “only the AfD can save Germany”. Translated, Musk’s piece said: “The portrayal of the AfD as rightwing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has classified the AfD at the national level as a suspected extremism case since 2021. Shortly after the piece was published online, the editor of the opinion section, Eva Marie Kogel, used the US tech mogul’s own platform to post on X that she had submitted her resignation. “I always enjoyed heading the opinion department at Welt and Wams. Today a text by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. Yesterday I submitted my resignation after printing,” she posted. She included a link to the Musk commentary article. The AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance and, like incoming president Donald Trump in relation to the US, is calling for mass deportations from Germany. Earlier in December, Musk not only posted in favor of AfD but the party’s hard line on immigration appeared to resonate with the incoming US vice-president, JD Vance, MSNBC reported. Senior Welt Group figures weighed in on Saturday. “Democracy and journalism thrive on freedom of expression.","Elon Musk is a tech businessman and helps Donald Trump. He has now shown support for a German political party called AfD. This is a big surprise.

Musk wrote an article for a German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag. The editor of the newspaper's opinion section quit because of this.

The newspaper is important in Germany. It is owned by a company that also owns Politico in the USA.

Musk's article tries to say AfD is not extreme. He uses simple words to do this. He wrote something similar on his social media site, X. He said that only AfD can help Germany.

In the article, Musk said that AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, has a partner who is from Sri Lanka and is the same sex. He asks if this sounds like Hitler.

Germany's intelligence agency thinks AfD might be extremist. They have been watching them since 2021.

The editor who quit, Eva Marie Kogel, wrote on X that she resigned after Musk's article was printed. She linked to the article.

AfD does not want many immigrants in Germany. They want to send people out of Germany. Donald Trump wants to do the same in the USA.

Before, Musk wrote that he liked AfD. JD Vance, who might be the next vice-president of the US, also seemed to agree with AfD's ideas about immigration.

People at Welt newspaper talked about this. They said that freedom of speech is important for democracy and journalism."
54,54_1,1,"This includes dealing with polarising positions and classifying them journalistically,” the newspaper’s editor-in-chief designate, Jan Philipp Burgard, and Ulf Poschardt, who takes over as publisher on 1 January, told Reuters. They said discussion about Musk’s piece, which had about 340 comments several hours after it was published, was “very revealing”. Underneath Musk’s commentary, the newspaper published a response by Burgard. “Musk’s diagnosis is correct, but his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally false,” he wrote, referencing the AfD’s desire to leave the European Union and seek rapprochement with Russia as well as appease China. Musk and Weidel both later posted a link to the article on X. The AfD backing from Musk, who also defended his right to weigh in on German politics due to his “significant investments”, comes as Germans are set to vote on 23 February after a coalition government led by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed late this fall. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a centre-right or centre-left majority, but Germany’s mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level.","The new head of the newspaper and the new boss said something to Reuters. The head is Jan Philipp Burgard. The boss is Ulf Poschardt. They will start their jobs on January 1st.

They talked about a piece written by Elon Musk. People were talking about Musk's piece a lot. There were about 340 comments after a few hours. The newspaper people said this was important to see.

The newspaper also wrote a response to Musk's piece. Burgard wrote the response. He said Musk was right about the problem. But he said Musk's solution was wrong. Musk thinks the AfD party can save Germany. Burgard thinks this is a bad idea. The AfD wants to leave the European Union. They also want to be friendly with Russia and China.

Musk and Weidel shared a link to the article on X. Weidel is a leader in the AfD party.

Musk supports the AfD. He said he can talk about German politics because he has put a lot of money into Germany.

Germany will vote on February 23rd. The government of Olaf Scholz fell apart. He is the German leader. The AfD party is doing well in the polls. They might stop other parties from winning. But other parties have said they will not work with the AfD."
55,55_0,0,"Dominique Pelicot will not appeal against his conviction for drugging and raping his wife and inviting strangers to rape her, his lawyer has said. Béatrice Zavarro said the former electrician, 72, who was jailed for the maximum 20 years this month, wished to spare his now ex-wife, Gisèle Pelicot, a new ordeal but admitted there was also the risk a new trial in front of a public jury could mean a longer prison sentence. Pelicot and the 50 others who were all found guilty of rape or sexual assault after a three-and-a-half-month trial have until midnight on Monday to lodge an appeal. A statement from public prosecutor confirmed that 17 people had so far appealed against their convictions, adding that a new trial would be held in Nîmes towards the end of next year. Gisèle Pelicot, 72, a retired logistics manager, believes she may have been raped more than 200 times by her husband and other men between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after filming up the skirts of female shoppers in a supermarket near the couple’s home in the Provençal town of Mazan. Detectives subsequently found tens of thousands of videos of the abuse on his phone and a hard drive. On Monday, Zavarro said Dominique Pelicot had decided not to appeal against his conviction because to do so would “force Gisèle into a new ordeal and new confrontations, which [he] rejects”. Appealing against the guilty judgment, when Pelicot admitted the charges, would involve “running an unnecessary risk”, she added, as the accusations could be made more serious in the appeal court, where the case would be held in front of a public jury, potentially leading to a longer prison term. “It is time to put an end to this judicially,” Zavarro said on Monday. The marathon rape trial in Avignon was heard by a panel of five professional magistrates. The appeal court, which sits in the southern city of Nîmes, will require a new full trial within the next year. Gisèle Pelicot is not required to attend the appeal hearing but her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, indicated she was ready to do so.","Dominique Pelicot was found guilty. He was guilty of giving drugs to his wife and raping her. He also invited other men to rape her.

His lawyer said he will not ask for another trial. The lawyer is Béatrice Zavarro. Dominique Pelicot is 72 years old. He used to be an electrician. He will stay in prison for 20 years. This is the longest time allowed.

Béatrice Zavarro said that Dominique Pelicot wants to protect his ex-wife. Her name is Gisèle Pelicot. He does not want her to go through another difficult time.

She also said that there is a risk. If there is a new trial, he could get a longer prison sentence. The new trial would be in front of many people.

Fifty other people were also found guilty. They were guilty of rape or sexual assault. They have until Monday to ask for another trial.

The public prosecutor said that 17 people have asked for another trial. The new trial will be in Nîmes next year.

Gisèle Pelicot is 72 years old. She used to manage things for a company. She thinks she was raped more than 200 times. This happened between 2011 and 2020.

Dominique Pelicot was caught when he was filming women in a store. He was filming under their skirts. This was in a town called Mazan. It is near where they lived.

The police found many videos on his phone and computer. The videos showed the abuse.

On Monday, Béatrice Zavarro said Dominique Pelicot will not ask for a new trial. He does not want Gisèle Pelicot to suffer again. He does not want her to face new problems.

He admitted he did the things he was accused of. If he asks for a new trial, the situation could become worse. The court could decide to give him an even longer time in prison.

Béatrice Zavarro said it is time for this to end.

The trial in Avignon lasted a long time. Five judges listened to the case.

The appeal court is in Nîmes. There will be a new trial there within the next year.

Gisèle Pelicot does not have to go to the new trial. But her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, said she is ready to go if needed."
55,55_1,1,"“She has told us she will be there. Maybe not every day but she says she will go,” he said. She became an international feminist figurehead after insisting the trial be held in open court and the videos of her abuse shown in order that “shame changes sides”. The trial has caused much soul-searcing in France and calls to tighten French rape laws, including introducing the concept of “consent”, which is absent. The trial also threw a spotlight on attitudes towards the rape and sexual abuse of women in France, where 94% of reported rape cases are dropped without any action. “From Gisèle Pelicot’s point of view, there is no sentence that will give her back what she has lost,” Babonneau said. “All Gisèle Pelicot wanted is to have the accused convicted for what they did to her. As for the personal sentences, she respects the decision of the court and finds no solace in them.”","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR B2 level English:

He said, ""She told us she will be there."" He added, ""Maybe she will not be there every day."" But she said she will go to the trial.

She became a famous feminist around the world. This happened after she wanted her trial to be public. She also wanted the videos of her abuse to be shown. She wanted this so that people who should be ashamed would feel ashamed.

The trial has made people in France think deeply. People are talking about making the rape laws stronger. They want to add the idea of ""consent"" to the laws. Now, the laws do not mention ""consent.""

The trial also showed how people in France think about rape and abuse of women. It showed that many rape cases are not taken seriously. In fact, 94% of reported rape cases are stopped. Nothing happens in these cases.

Babonneau said, ""Gisèle Pelicot thinks no sentence can give her back what she lost."" He added, ""Gisèle Pelicot only wanted the accused people to be found guilty for what they did to her.""

He continued, ""She respects the court's decision about the sentences. But the sentences do not make her feel better."""
56,56_0,0,"Work has begun to conserve and digitise one of the oldest paper documents still in existence on the island of Ireland. The ecclesiastical register, which dates back to the medieval period, is about 650 years old. It belonged to the former archbishop of Armagh Milo Sweteman. Its delicate pages are being repaired by experts at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni) as part of an initiative to rejuvenate and preserve some of the island of Ireland’s most important historical texts. Ecclesiastical registers contain copies or drafts of documents created by the archbishops’ administration work, including legal papers, official letters, correspondence, receipts and wills. The register belonging to Sweteman dates to his time in the senior clerical role from 1361 to 1380. Conservation work on the register of archbishop John Swayne, dated from 1418 to 1438, has already been completed and a digitised copy, along with a translated summary, are now available online. The conservation work on the Swayne books involved carefully detaching bindings dating from the 17th century, gently washing all the paper folios and then consolidating each piece of paper with a weak gelatine solution. Tears and losses in the paper were infilled with Japanese kozo paper before the books were rebound using 17th-century binding material. The work now under way on the Sweteman register involves the need to repair damage that resulted from previous conservation efforts dating back to the start of the 20th century when tracing paper was placed on the pages in an attempt to preserve them. The tracing paper was acidic and actually accelerated the corrosion of the ink and paper. It is now being removed using a specialist gel before being subjected to a low-pressure washing process. The same kozo paper and wheat starch paste repairs used for Swayne’s register are then being undertaken. Similar work is being carried out on a third register, dated between 1400 and 1418, that belonged to former archbishop Nicholas Fleming. Sarah Graham, head of conservation at Proni, explained that paper was extremely rare on the island of Ireland when the registers were compiled.","Work has started on an old paper document. It is one of the oldest in Ireland.

The document is a church record. It is about 650 years old. This means it is from the Middle Ages.

It belonged to Milo Sweteman. He was an archbishop in Armagh.

Experts are fixing the old book. They work at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni).

They want to save important old books from Ireland.

Church records have copies of documents. These documents were made by the archbishop's office.

They include legal papers, letters, and receipts. They also have wills.

Sweteman's record is from 1361 to 1380. This was when he was a leader in the church.

They already fixed the record of John Swayne. He was also an archbishop. His record is from 1418 to 1438.

You can now see a copy of it online. There is also a summary that is easy to read.

To fix Swayne's book, they took it apart. They washed the paper carefully.

Then, they made the paper stronger. They used a weak gel.

They fixed tears in the paper. They used special Japanese paper.

Then, they put the book back together. They used old materials from the 1600s.

Now, they are working on Sweteman's book. It was damaged before. People tried to fix it in the past.

They put thin paper on the pages to protect them. This was in the early 1900s.

But the thin paper was bad for the book. It made the ink and paper break down faster.

Now, they are taking off the thin paper. They are using a special gel. Then, they will wash the pages carefully.

They will use the same Japanese paper to fix it. They will also use wheat paste. This is how they fixed Swayne's book.

They are also working on another record. It belonged to Nicholas Fleming. He was an archbishop too. His record is from 1400 to 1418.

Sarah Graham works at Proni. She said paper was rare in Ireland. This was when these records were made."
56,56_1,1,"It was a period that just predated the invention of the printing press when parchment from animal skins was still the preferred writing material. “Paper that pre-dates 1450 is particularly rare, it didn’t occur in Ireland for a couple of centuries after the register of Milo Sweteman or the register of John Swayne were completed,” said Graham. “We’ve done some research into the watermarks and know that the paper came from Italy and from Spain.” Graham said it was likely the archbishops imported the paper to Ireland during their travels around Europe. The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland is an effort to partially recreate the rich historical archive that was destroyed when the Public Record Office of Ireland in Dublin was set alight in June 1922 in the beginning of the Irish civil war. Graham emphasised the importance of preserving the centuries-old documents that do still exist. “The work that we do in conservation more broadly is really important to stabilise the collections so that they’re available to the public now, but they’re also available for generations to come, so that future generations are able to understand where they come from, what their history is, and the primary source of material is here and available to them,” she said.","Here is the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level:

Before printing was invented, people wrote on animal skin. This skin was called parchment. Paper from before 1450 is very rare.

Graham said this kind of paper was not in Ireland for a long time. This was after the registers of Milo Sweteman and John Swayne were written.

""We looked at the marks on the paper,"" Graham said. ""We know the paper came from Italy and Spain.""

Graham thinks the archbishops brought the paper to Ireland. They probably got it when they traveled in Europe.

The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland is trying to rebuild a lost archive. This archive was destroyed in a fire. The Public Record Office of Ireland burned down in Dublin in 1922. This happened at the start of the Irish civil war.

Graham said it is important to keep old papers safe.

""We need to protect these old collections,"" she said. ""This way, people can see them now. And people in the future can see them too.""

She added, ""Future generations can learn about their history. They can see the original papers for themselves."""
57,57_0,0,"South Korea’s intelligence agency has reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine has died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces. Seoul’s spy agency earlier on Friday confirmed Ukrainian reports that an injured North Korean soldier had been captured by Ukrainian forces, in what was likely to have been the first capture of its kind since Pyongyang sent combat forces to bolster Russian forces in the war. The South Korean national intelligence service said in a statement: “Through real-time information sharing with an allied country’s intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured.” The agency later said the captured soldier had died from his injuries. A photo of the soldier, who looked gaunt and appeared to have been injured, circulated on the Telegram messaging app, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. In his nightly video address on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said North Korean troops fighting in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s president said Russian troops were doing everything to ensure that North Korean soldiers were not taken prisoner by Kyiv. He said some North Korean soldiers had been captured by Ukrainian forces, but were hurt so badly they could not be saved. Earlier the Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that special forces had captured the soldier in the Kursk region, where Ukraine has seized and held some territory. The outlet did not say when the capture took place, and there has been no confirmation from officials in Ukraine or North Korea, where the state media have not referred to the deployment of the country’s troops. Militarnyi said that if it was confirmed, the soldier would be the first North Korean combatant to have been taken by Ukrainian forces. As many as 11,000 soldiers from North Korea have been deployed to help Russia, months after Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defence pact that committed each country to come to the other’s aid if attacked. While the North could gain valuable battlefield experience, its poorly trained soldiers, fighting in unfamiliar territory, have quickly been exposed to the dangers of combat.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

South Korea's spy agency said something happened in Ukraine. A North Korean soldier was fighting there for Russia. Ukrainian soldiers caught him.

This was probably the first time a North Korean soldier was captured. North Korea sent soldiers to help Russia in the war.

The South Korean agency said they knew about the soldier. They got information from another country's spy agency. The North Korean soldier was hurt when he was captured.

Later, the agency said the soldier died. He died because of his injuries.

A picture of the soldier was on a messaging app. He looked thin and hurt. This information came from a South Korean news agency.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the leader of Ukraine. He said something in a video. He said North Korean soldiers are fighting in Russia. They are in the Kursk area. They are losing many soldiers. Russia is not protecting them well.

The Ukrainian president said Russian soldiers don't want North Korean soldiers to be captured. He said some North Korean soldiers were captured. But they were too badly hurt to save.

A Ukrainian news source said special forces captured the soldier. They captured him in the Kursk area. Ukraine has taken some land there. The news source did not say when this happened.

No one from Ukraine or North Korea has confirmed this. North Korean news has not talked about sending soldiers.

The Ukrainian news source said this might be the first time a North Korean soldier was captured.

About 11,000 North Korean soldiers are helping Russia. This happened after Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin signed an agreement. The agreement says each country will help the other if attacked.

North Korea might learn from the war. But their soldiers are not well trained. They are fighting in a place they don't know. So, they are in danger."
57,57_1,1,"Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, known as the GUR, said on Thursday that North Korean troops were suffering heavy losses in the fighting in Kursk and facing logistical difficulties as a result of Ukrainian attacks. The GUR said Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka had inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units and that North Korean troops also faced supply issues, including shortages of drinking water. This week Zelenskyy claimed that more than 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in the Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties. On Friday a White House spokesperson said 1,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the past week alone. “It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences,” John Kirby said. He described the North Korean troops’ offensive as “massed, dismounted assaults” and said Joe Biden was likely to approve another security assistance package for Ukraine in coming days. The deployment of North Korean soldiers marked a dramatic escalation in the war, which began almost three years ago, as the Kremlin turned to its ally to boost its forces. It was also seen as an attempt by Putin to broaden the conflict through the direct involvement in fighting of a third country. Slovakia, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that it would host peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, despite Ukraine’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Putin. On Thursday the Russian president said it was “acceptable” for the country to become a “platform” for dialogue over the conflict, which the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said he could end after he takes office in January. That prospect has raised concerns in Kyiv that a settlement could be imposed on terms favourable to Moscow, as Ukraine struggles on the battlefield.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

Ukraine has a military spy group called GUR. On Thursday, GUR said North Korean soldiers are dying a lot in Kursk. They also have problems getting supplies because Ukraine is attacking them.

GUR said Ukrainian attacks near Novoivanovka hurt North Korean soldiers a lot. The North Korean soldiers also do not have enough water and other things.

This week, Zelenskyy said over 3,000 North Korean soldiers died or were hurt in Kursk. This is the first time Ukraine has given a big number for North Korean losses.

On Friday, a person from the White House said 1,000 North Korean soldiers died or were hurt in Kursk just last week.

John Kirby said Russia and North Korea do not care about these soldiers. They are sending them to attack Ukrainian defenses, even though it is hopeless.

He said the North Korean soldiers are attacking in big groups on foot. He also said that Joe Biden will probably send more help to Ukraine soon.

North Korea sending soldiers is a big change in the war. The war started almost three years ago. Russia is asking North Korea for help to make its army stronger.

People think Putin wants to make the war bigger by getting another country to fight.

Slovakia said on Friday that it will have peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine thinks Slovakia is helping Putin.

On Thursday, the Russian president said it is okay for Slovakia to be a place for talks about the war. Donald Trump said he can stop the war after he becomes president in January.

This makes Ukraine worried. They think they might have to agree to a deal that helps Russia because Ukraine is having problems in the war."
58,58_0,0,"At first, there seemed nothing to be afraid of. Joe Giardina, his wife, Evanna, and their 16-year-old son, Paul, were taking in the picture-perfect waters of Patong bay as they ate breakfast in their Phuket beachfront hotel on Boxing Day morning in 2004. “We were admiring the view and all of a sudden the water disappeared,” says Giardina, 67, speaking from his home in Rosanna, Victoria. The water level had dropped so quickly that fish were floundering on the exposed seabed. But rather than sensing any threat, curious onlookers made their way to the beach. “The locals thought, ‘This is fantastic.’ They were running around picking the fish up.” Now Giardina knows it’s a sign to flee to higher ground. About 550km to the south-west, a magnitude 9.15 earthquake had struck 30km below the Andaman Sea, triggering what would become the most devastating tsunami in history. Paul was one of 26 Australians among more than 230,000 people whose lives were lost across 14 countries – in some impact zones, the waves reached up to 3o metres above sea level. Twenty years on, Giardina’s memories of the disaster are as vivid as they were in its immediate aftermath. “It really feels like it was only yesterday,” he says of that initially deceptive morning. Within about half an hour the sea had returned to its normal level and settled, then it began to swirl, gently stirring up the sand below. Almost simultaneously, the nearby pier started to float away. A small amount of water – no more than 20cm – washed on to the road bordering the restaurant. “It didn’t look dangerous – we said, ‘We’re going to get wet,’” Giardina remembers. But when a car was washed towards the hotel, he began to run, leading Paul by the hand and then attempting to protect his son by holding him against a pillar inside the hotel. Seconds later, a waist-high wall of water hit them from behind, throwing them over an internal wall and ripping Giardina’s clothes from his body.","Joe Giardina, his wife Evanna, and their son Paul were on vacation. Paul was 16 years old. It was December 26, 2004. They were eating breakfast at their hotel in Phuket, Thailand. The hotel was near the beach.

Joe looked at the sea. He thought it was a beautiful morning. Suddenly, the water went away. The water level dropped very fast. Fish were left on the sand.

People were surprised. They did not think it was dangerous. They went to the beach to catch the fish. Joe Giardina now knows this was a warning. It meant they should go to higher ground.

There had been a big earthquake. It was about 550 kilometers away. The earthquake caused a tsunami. A tsunami is a very big wave. This tsunami was the worst in history.

Paul was one of many people who died. More than 230,000 people died in 14 countries. The waves were very high in some places. They were 30 meters tall.

It has been twenty years since the tsunami. Joe Giardina remembers everything clearly. He says it feels like it happened yesterday.

After the water went away, it came back. The sea went back to normal for a short time. Then, the water started to move in circles. The sand on the bottom moved around. A pier near the hotel started to float away.

Some water came onto the road. It was not very high. It was only about 20 centimeters. Joe thought they would only get a little wet.

Then, a car was pushed towards the hotel by the water. Joe knew it was dangerous. He started to run. He held Paul's hand. He tried to keep Paul safe by holding him against a wall inside the hotel.

A big wave hit them. The water was up to their waists. It pushed them over a wall. The water tore Joe's clothes off."
58,58_1,1,"Cars and tables slammed into the building as everything in the path of the 800km/h wave was lifted and flung high. Something hit Giardina on the back of the head and he went under, losing hold of Paul. Giardina found himself pushed horizontally against the outer corner of the hotel when a large object – a car, a fridge, he’ll never know – pinned his left arm to the wall. “I’m trying with my right hand to get out, get around the corner, to push away whatever was holding me. And I just couldn’t get there. I was underwater and I held my breath for as long as I could. The last thing I recall is just opening my mouth and that was it. The lights went off.” Today, he still finds consolation in the thought that Paul, whose body was found in a makeshift morgue by Joe’s brothers-in-law three days later, might have experienced something similar. “I can only hope – and it’s terrible – but I can only hope that Paul went through the same experience,” he says. “There was no suffering.” The Giardinas had weighed up whether to visit Thailand or Bali for Paul’s first overseas trip. Paul had Down’s syndrome and, while physically high-functioning, was unable to care for himself. Phuket seemed a safer option two years after Bali’s terrorist attacks and the family – Paul’s sister, two years his senior, stayed in Australia – chose to celebrate Christmas at Patong’s Seaview hotel, where Paul played ball in the swimming pool and was photographed smiling with Santa. Joe and Evanna called their affectionate son the “love machine”. “Twice in his short life, he had open heart surgery. The second time, he’d had a valve replaced in his heart, and when he’s woken up from the surgery, what was his first comment? It wasn’t tears and crying and screaming, it was ‘What happened?’ There wouldn’t be too many of us behaving that way,” Joe Giardina says, laughing. Giardina was found inside the hotel, lying prone and headfirst down a flight of steps on the third storey.","The big wave was very strong. It moved at 800 kilometers per hour. It picked up cars and tables. It threw them into buildings.

Something hit Giardina's head. He fell under the water. He lost his grip on Paul.

Giardina was pushed against the corner of the hotel. A big thing held his arm against the wall. He did not know if it was a car or a fridge.

He tried to move away with his other hand. But he could not. He was underwater. He held his breath for a long time. Then he opened his mouth. That was the last thing he remembered. Everything went dark.

Paul's body was found three days later. It was in a temporary place for dead people. Giardina hopes Paul did not suffer. He hopes Paul's experience was similar to his own. He hopes Paul did not feel pain.

The Giardina family wanted to take Paul on a trip. They thought about Thailand or Bali. Paul had Down's syndrome. He needed help taking care of himself.

They chose Phuket because it seemed safer. It was two years after the Bali attacks. The family stayed at the Seaview hotel in Patong. Paul played with a ball in the pool. He had his picture taken with Santa. His parents called him ""love machine"".

Paul had heart surgery twice. The second time, they fixed a part of his heart. When he woke up, he asked, ""What happened?"" He did not cry or scream. His father thinks that was very brave.

Giardina was found inside the hotel. He was lying on the third floor. His head was pointing down the stairs."
58,58_2,2,"His position saved his life: water drained out of his body. Initially deemed unlikely to survive, he was eventually taken to Bangkok hospital in Phuket, where the pain from his extensive injuries was numbed by the fear that he had lost Paul and Evanna. His wife was found unhurt and later reunited with him – she had ridden the wave to the hotel, grabbed hold of a balcony and miraculously avoided being sucked back out to sea. When Giardina was medevaced to Melbourne, the doctors’ first job was to flush the sand out of his lungs. “The one thing that it has taught me is how quickly it can all come to an end. You appreciate every day when you go through something like that,” he says, describing the speed at which the morning went from one of tropical calm to earth-shattering calamity. He and Evanna are grateful to have found Paul’s body among Thailand’s 5,400 victims, “because if we hadn’t, I know that there would be a sense of ‘He could be out there still’. And where do you start? We would have been walking the streets looking for him. And that would have been …” He pauses. “How do you cope with that?” It’s not accidental that when visitors to the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial take in the wave-shaped sculpture on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, they are also facing the water. Giardina instigated the memorial and requested that its aspect include water. Its unveiling in December 2015 was the first time Joe and Evanna had met all 25 of the other Australian victims’ families, after a 10-year process involving three governments. It’s given them a place where they can remember Paul, and this 26 December they plan to be there again, with their son in spirit. But part of Paul will always remain in Phuket. Joe and Evanna returned to Patong in October 2005 and again on the first anniversary of the disaster, and Joe has visited Thailand many times since, partly so that the tsunami does not dictate how he lives. “It’s part of the healing. I feel like part of Paul is there. If I didn’t go back, the tsunami would win.","He was lucky because of how he was lying. Water went out of his body. At first, people thought he would die. But he was taken to a hospital in Bangkok, in Phuket. He was in a lot of pain from his injuries. But he was more worried about Paul and Evanna. He thought he might have lost them.

His wife was okay. She was not hurt. She found him later. She was on the wave and it took her to the hotel. She held onto a balcony. It was a miracle she did not get pulled back into the sea.

Giardina was flown to Melbourne for more help. The doctors had to clean the sand out of his lungs. He said that this event showed him how fast life can change. He said you should be thankful for every day after something like this. He talked about how the morning went from peaceful to terrible so quickly.

He and Evanna are thankful they found Paul's body. Many people died in Thailand, about 5,400. They are glad they found Paul. If they had not, they would always wonder if he was still alive. They would not know where to look for him. This would be very hard. He stopped talking for a moment. He said, ""How do you deal with that?""

There is a special place to remember the tsunami. It is by a lake in Canberra. It has a statue that looks like a wave. When people look at the statue, they also see the water. Giardina helped to make this memorial. He wanted it to include water.

The memorial was opened in December 2015. It was the first time Joe and Evanna met the families of other Australians who died. There were 25 families. It took 10 years to build the memorial. Three different governments helped.

The memorial is a place where they can remember Paul. They plan to go there again on December 26. They will remember their son Paul. But a part of Paul will always be in Phuket.

Joe and Evanna went back to Patong in October 2005. They also went back on the first anniversary of the tsunami. Joe has been to Thailand many times since then. He does not want the tsunami to control his life. He said going back helps him heal. He feels like a part of Paul is still there. He said if he did not go back, the tsunami would win."

59,59_0,0,"The United Nations chief has denounced the “escalation” in hostilities between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Israel, calling IDF strikes on targets including at the airport in Sana’a “especially alarming” after it came under attack while the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane. Israel struck multiple targets linked to the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen on Thursday, including the international airport in the capital, Sana’a. Houthi media said at least six people were killed. A spokesperson for UN secretary general, António Guterres, said in a statement: “The secretary general condemns the escalation between Yemen and Israel. Israeli airstrikes today on Sana’a international airport, the Red Sea ports and power stations in Yemen are especially alarming … “Today’s airstrikes follow around a year of escalatory actions by the Houthis in the Red Sea and the region that threaten civilians, regional stability and freedom of maritime navigation.” The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a social media post on Thursday that he was about to board a plane at the airport when it came under aerial attack. A crew member on the plane was injured, he said, and at least two people were reported killed at the airport. “The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave. My UN and @WHO colleagues and I are safe. Our heartfelt condolences to the families whose loved ones lost their lives in the attack.” Tedros said he had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of UN staff detained by the Houthis and assess the humanitarian situation. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Agence France-Presse on whether they were aware of Tedros’ presence at the time. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Thursday afternoon that Israel’s air force attacked Houthi targets on the coastline and in Sanaa, adding: “We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran’s evil axis.","The leader of the United Nations is worried. Fighting between the Houthis in Yemen and Israel is getting worse.

The Houthis are a group fighting in Yemen. Israel is attacking places in Yemen. The UN leader thinks these attacks are very bad.

The airport in Sana'a, Yemen was attacked. This is especially worrying. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) was at the airport. He was about to get on a plane.

Israel attacked many places in Yemen on Thursday. These places were connected to the Houthis. The Houthis have support from Iran. The Sana'a airport was one of the places attacked.

Houthi news said that at least six people died.

The UN leader, António Guterres, said something about this. He said he does not like the fighting between Yemen and Israel. He thinks the attacks on the airport, ports, and power plants are very worrying.

The Houthis have been doing things that make the area more dangerous for a year. These actions put people in danger. They also make it hard for ships to travel safely.

The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wrote about the attack. He said he was at the airport when it was attacked. A person working on the plane was hurt. He said at least two people died at the airport.

The airport control tower and waiting area were damaged. These places were very close to where he was. He needs to wait for the airport to be fixed before he can leave. He and his UN and WHO friends are safe. He feels sad for the families who lost people in the attack.

Tedros was in Yemen to talk about getting UN workers released. The Houthis were holding them. He was also there to see how people in Yemen were doing.

Someone asked the Israeli military if they knew Tedros was at the airport. They did not answer right away.

The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, said something. He said Israel attacked Houthi places on the coast and in Sana'a. He wants to stop the Houthis because they are connected to Iran. He thinks Iran is evil."
59,59_1,1,"We will persist in this until we complete the task.” Netanyahu said in an interview with Channel 14 that Israel was only at the beginning of its campaign against the Houthis. “We are just getting started with them,” he said. Houthis have repeatedly fired drones and missiles towards Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli military said that in addition to striking the airport, it also hit military infrastructure at the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib on Yemen’s west coast. It also attacked the country’s Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations. The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency said that three people were killed in the strikes on the airport and three were killed in Hodeidah, while 40 others were wounded in the attacks. Later on Thursday, the Houthis said they were ready to respond quickly to the attack and meet “escalation with escalation”, Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported. The Houthi transport minister told Saba that both the airport and Hodeidah port would resume normal operations from Friday. More than a year of Houthi attacks has disrupted international shipping routes, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys that have in turn stoked fears over global inflation. The UN security council is due to meet on Monday over the Houthi attacks on Israel, Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel’s military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse","""We will keep going until we finish this work,"" said Netanyahu. He spoke to Channel 14. He said Israel has only just started fighting the Houthis. ""We are just beginning with them,"" he said.

The Houthis have sent many drones and missiles to Israel. They say they are helping the Palestinians in Gaza.

The Israeli army said they attacked the airport. They also attacked military places in Hodeidah, Salif, and Ras Kanatib. These places are on the west coast of Yemen. They also attacked the Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations in Yemen.

The Saba news agency is controlled by the Houthis. They said three people died in the airport attacks. They also said three people died in Hodeidah. Forty other people were hurt in the attacks.

Later on Thursday, the Houthis said they are ready to fight back quickly. They said they will ""escalate with escalation,"" according to Al Masirah TV, which is run by the Houthis.

The Houthi transport minister told Saba that the airport and Hodeidah port will open again on Friday.

The Houthis have been attacking for over a year. This has made problems for ships traveling around the world. Companies have to use longer and more costly routes. This has caused worry about prices going up all over the world.

The UN Security Council will meet on Monday. They will talk about the Houthi attacks on Israel. Danny Danon, Israel's UN ambassador, said this on Wednesday.

On Saturday, Israel's army could not stop a missile from Yemen. The missile hit the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area. Fourteen people were hurt.

60,60_0,0,"Paul Volcker, who has died aged 92, was the most eminent financial statesman of his generation, the sworn enemy of the abuse of finance in any of its manifestations. That could be indulging inflation as the financial outcome of governments and society living beyond their means, or investment banks deluding themselves they had uncovered the alchemy of risk-free lending through the issuance of ever more complex financial derivatives. His twin mantras were that finance should be the servant not the master of economy and society. And that good government is an indispensable component of a good society, in particular keeping the temptations of clever-clever finance at bay. Sound money and good government went hand in hand. He practised what he preached, seizing the opportunity to embody his beliefs when the moment arrived. Standing over 6ft 7in, and a lover of over-sized cigars and fly-fishing, he represented the best of New England liberalism – genial, good humoured and steely. From August 1979 to August 1987 he was chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the US’s central bank, appointed by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and and reappointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. In the early part of that period he crushed inflation out of the US economy. Just 18 months after he was appointed he had the courage to raise interest rates to 20% – a rate never seen before – prompting mass protests as the US economy plunged into recession. But he held firm and succeeded, inflation peaking at 14.8% before falling back to 3% by 1983. The foundations had been laid for sustained economic recovery and in the process warranting the principle that central bank independence is a crucial precondition for robust monetary policy. It was one of the defining moments in US monetary policy history, winning him plaudits not only for his resilience in the face of near universal criticism but also from the small but fast growing influential band of free market, “monetarist” economists who believed that control of the money supply using high interest rates was the sole means to curb inflation – not any kind of government interference into the market processes for setting wages and prices. Volcker temporarily was their hero. But they misjudged the man.","Paul Volcker has died. He was 92 years old. He was a very important person in the world of money. He did not like it when people used money in the wrong way.

He thought that governments and people should not spend more money than they have. He also thought that banks should not trick themselves into thinking they can lend money without any risk. They did this by creating complicated financial products.

Volcker believed two important things. First, money should help the economy and people, not control them. Second, good government is needed for a good society. The government should stop people from misusing money. He believed that good money management and good government work together.

He showed what he believed by his actions. He was a tall man, over 6 feet 7 inches. He liked big cigars and fishing. He was a kind and strong person.

From 1979 to 1987, he was in charge of the US Federal Reserve. This is the central bank of the United States. President Jimmy Carter chose him, and President Ronald Reagan chose him again.

At that time, the US economy had a big problem with inflation. Inflation means that prices were going up quickly. Volcker stopped this.

Only one and a half years after he started, he made a brave decision. He raised interest rates to 20%. This was very high, and people protested. The US economy got worse for a while.

But Volcker did not change his mind. He kept the interest rates high. Finally, inflation went down. It had been almost 15%, but it went down to 3% by 1983.

This helped the economy get better. It also showed that central banks need to be independent. This means they need to make their own decisions about money. This is important for a healthy economy.

It was a very important moment in US money history. People praised Volcker for being strong even when almost everyone disagreed with him. Some economists who believed in free markets also liked what he did. They thought that raising interest rates was the best way to stop inflation. They did not want the government to control prices or wages. Volcker was their hero for a short time.

But they were wrong about him."
60,60_1,1,"Volcker never bought the proposition that the market was magical or that there could be a systematic relationship between the growth of the money supply and inflation. Rather he was intuitively suspicious of the short term and predatory instincts of most financial market participants, which lead to volatile and unpredictable market movements, and intuitively suspicious of the mania for dismantling the New Deal rules and regulations that restrained their worst types of behaviours that “free market“ economists said were inhibiting the efficiency of the US financial system. His willingness to be austere in raising interest rates so high was because he knew dear money worked reliably in squeezing inflation – not because he was an advocate of a hyper-free-market economy. He would be equally austere in resisting the siren calls to deregulate finance in the name of freeing up the market. It would come to no good. Nor did it. Volcker was a critic of successive rounds of financial deregulation after he left office, saying that the only useful financial innovation he had encountered was the invention of the ATM – cash dispensing machines. Even before the 2008-09 financial crisis he was warning that the invention of mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps were inherently unstable, in effect transferring risk to the Federal Reserve, which would be compelled to underwrite the financial system if the markets ever lost confidence in them. So it proved as the financial crisis broke for precisely the reasons about which he had warned – unlike his successor Alan Greenspan, who had enthusiastically and uncritically embraced financial deregulation. President Obama appointed him head of the president’s economic advisory board in 2009 in the midst of the crisis. There he argued that the emergence of banks that were too big to fail, so forcing central bank rescues, was morally and economically insupportable and they should be broken up. If that was politically impossible then at least commercial banks who took deposits from the ordinary public should be banned from trading in high-risk financial derivatives on their own account – the so-called Volcker rule. Obama adopted the proposal and it became section 619 of the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act; banks cannot own, invest in or sponsor hedge funds, private equity funds or other trading operations for their own use.","Paul Volcker did not believe the market was perfect. He did not think the amount of money and inflation were always linked.

He did not trust the short-term goals of people in the market. He thought they could cause the market to change quickly and unexpectedly.

Volcker did not like getting rid of rules from the New Deal. These rules stopped bad behavior in the market. Some economists said these rules stopped the US financial system from working well.

Volcker raised interest rates very high. He did this because he knew it would stop inflation. It was not because he wanted a completely free market.

He also did not want to remove rules from the financial system. He thought it would cause problems. And it did.

After he left his job, Volcker criticized the removal of financial rules. He said the only good financial invention was the ATM.

Before the 2008 financial crisis, he warned about mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps. He thought they were dangerous. He said they moved risk to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve would have to support the financial system if people lost trust in these things.

This happened during the financial crisis. It was just as he had warned. Alan Greenspan, who came after Volcker, liked the removal of financial rules. He did not see the problems.

In 2009, President Obama made Volcker head of his economic advisory board. This was during the crisis.

Volcker said banks that were ""too big to fail"" were a problem. They forced the central bank to help them. He thought this was not fair or good for the economy. He said these banks should be broken up.

If that was not possible, he said banks that take money from the public should not be allowed to trade in risky financial things. This was called the Volcker rule.

Obama agreed with this idea. It became part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act. Banks cannot own or invest in hedge funds or other trading things for their own profit."
60,60_2,2,"Volcker had once again made an indelible mark on the US financial system, and influenced British thinking in the legal obligation to ringfence commercial and investment bank operations. Born in Cape May, on the southern tip of New Jersey, Paul Jr was the son of Paul Volcker, a civil engineer, and his wife, Alma (nee Klippel); his grandparents were all German immigrants. He grew up in the conventional world of 1930s and 40s America – going to high school, attending the local Lutheran church, but already showing an interest in public affairs and a precocious intelligence . He gained a degree in history, economics and political science at Princeton University (1949), and went on to do a master’s in political economy and government at Harvard, and to study at the London school of Economics. In 1952 he joined the New York Federal Reserve as an economist. A career alternating between Wall Street and the US Treasury in ever more responsible jobs then followed before fatefully he caught the eye of President Carter in 1979. He was a convinced believer in international collaboration, helping to fashion the Plaza accords in 1986 when Germany and Japan agreed to allow their currencies to appreciate, so limiting their trade imbalances with the US. This vital adjustment, he knew, would not come from market forces spontaneously but from intergovernmental collaboration. He was a founder of the Trilateral Commission, to foster relations between Japan, western Europe and north America, and regular attender at the Bilderberg meetings of leaders and experts from Europe and north America, believing that the key international players had to understand each other better. Towards the end of his life this believer in the power, capacity and importance of good government became increasingly concerned about the collapse of trust in government, founding the Volcker Alliance to advance the understanding of – and education for – careers in public service. In 1954 he married Barbara Bahnson; she died in 1998. In 2010 he married Anke Dening, and she survives him, along with James and Janice, the children of his first marriage. • Paul Adolph Volcker, central banker and economist, born 5 September 1927; died 8 December 2019","Paul Volcker changed the US financial system a lot. He also influenced how British banks worked. Banks in Britain had to separate their commercial and investment activities because of his ideas.

Paul Volcker was born in Cape May, New Jersey. His father, Paul Volcker, was an engineer. His mother was Alma. His grandparents came from Germany.

He grew up like many American children in the 1930s and 1940s. He went to high school and church. He was interested in government and very smart.

He studied history, economics, and politics at Princeton University. Then, he studied political economy and government at Harvard. He also studied at the London School of Economics.

In 1952, he started working at the New York Federal Reserve as an economist. He worked on Wall Street and for the US government. He got more important jobs over time. In 1979, President Carter noticed him.

He believed that countries should work together. In 1986, he helped create the Plaza Accords. Germany and Japan agreed to make their money worth more. This helped to fix trade problems with the US. He knew that this change would not happen without countries working together.

He helped start the Trilateral Commission. This group helped Japan, Europe, and North America work together. He also went to Bilderberg meetings. These meetings brought together leaders and experts from Europe and North America. He thought that important people from different countries needed to understand each other.

Later in his life, he worried that people did not trust the government. He started the Volcker Alliance. This group helped people learn about and work in government jobs. He thought good government was important.

He married Barbara Bahnson in 1954. She died in 1998. In 2010, he married Anke Dening. She is still alive. He also had two children, James and Janice, from his first marriage.

61,61_0,0,"High street sales slumped in November in the weakest period for consumer spending for more than a year, as shoppers reined in their spending in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales across Britain fell by 0.6% when compared with the previous month, with only household goods stores reporting growth. In a sign of the stress facing retailers, the quantity of goods bought dropped by 0.4% in the three months to November compared with the previous three months, the first decline since April 2018. Annual growth in sales also slowed to 1%, mainly because of a slump in spending in non-food stores. The latest figures from the high street and online suggest heavy discounting around Black Friday failed to tempt consumers to part with their cash in one of the worst periods for retailers in recent decades. Analysts said unsettled weather, political and economic uncertainty over Brexit and the snap election, and consumers leaving their shopping to the last minute in hope of bigger discounts, all had an impact last month. High street retailers are also struggling with rising wage bills and the cost of business rates, as well as tough competition as consumers switch to online shopping. Recognising the difficulties on the high street, the government said it was committed to a “fundamental review” of business rates and announced new measures to help independent retailers in the Queen’s speech on Thursday. The measures include a 50% discount on business rates for small to medium-sized high street properties including shops, pubs and restaurants with a rateable value of less than £51,000, up from a 33% discount at present. The discount is also being extended to cinemas and music venues. The plans are unlikely to do much to help troubled major retailers such as House of Fraser or Debenhams as retail chains are not eligible for the discount and neither are large department stores. November was the fourth month in a row without growth in retail spending – the longest stretch since the mid-90s. The ONS said Black Friday was not included in the figures, as the US-inspired day of shopping discounts fell late in the month, on 29 November. It said its seasonally adjusted estimates accounted for this shift in timing. However, analysts said the timing of Black Friday could have had an impact and probably distorted November’s spending figures. The ONS said Black Friday spending patterns would probably influence its December release, with only early promotions captured in the November estimates.","Shops sold less in November. It was the worst time for shops in over a year. People did not spend as much money before Christmas.

The Office for National Statistics said that shop sales in Britain went down by 0.6%. This means shops sold less than the month before. Only shops that sell things for the house sold more.

Shops are having problems. The amount of things people bought went down by 0.4%. This was from August to November. It is the first time this has happened since April 2018.

The amount of sales also grew slower. It only grew by 1%. This is because people did not buy as much from shops that sell things other than food.

The shops and websites had big sales for Black Friday. But people still did not spend much money. This was one of the worst times for shops in many years.

Experts say that bad weather made things worse. Also, people were not sure what would happen with Brexit and the election. People also waited to shop until the last minute to get better deals. These things all made sales go down in November.

Shops are also having problems with paying their workers more. They also have to pay high business rates. It is also hard for shops to compete with online shopping.

The government knows that shops are having problems. They said they will look at the business rates. They also said they will help small shops. This was said in the Queen’s speech.

The government will give small shops a discount of 50% on their business rates. This is for shops, pubs, and restaurants that are not very big. Right now, the discount is 33%. Cinemas and music places will also get this discount.

But this might not help big shops that are having problems. Shops like House of Fraser and Debenhams are too big to get the discount.

Sales have not grown for four months in a row. This is the longest time since the 1990s.

The Office for National Statistics said that Black Friday is not included in the numbers. Black Friday was late in November, on the 29th. The numbers take this into account.

But experts say that Black Friday might have made a difference. It might have made the numbers for November not show the real story.

The Office for National Statistics said that Black Friday will probably change the numbers for December. Only the sales before Black Friday are included in the November numbers."
61,61_1,1,"Duncan Brewer, a retail partner at the consultancy Oliver Wyman, said political uncertainty had lifted since the election and unemployment remained low, in a positive signal for consumer spending. However, he warned that at least two high street shopping chains were likely to go bust next year and about 100,000 jobs were likely to be cut across the sector. He said: “The slump in retail sales over November goes to show that despite the momentous shopping holiday of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, discounting periods are not an effective way of getting people into the shops.”","Okay, here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level:

Duncan Brewer works for a company called Oliver Wyman. He helps shops. He said some good things about shopping.

The election is over. Things are more sure now. Also, not many people are out of work. This is good for shops because people can spend money.

But, Duncan Brewer also said some bad things. He thinks some big shops will close next year. Maybe two big shops will fail.

This means about 100,000 people could lose their jobs. This is in the shopping business.

He also talked about sales. Shops have sales like Black Friday. This is when things are cheaper.

Duncan Brewer said sales do not always help. Even with sales, people did not buy much in November. So, sales are not always a good way to get people to shop."
62,62_0,0,"No one has dug into the vaults of the Bank of England and pilfered a gold bar, but security breaches for a central bank in the 21st-century age of information do not come much worse than this. Hedge funds have managed to gain access to an audio feed of the governor’s press conferences, thereby securing for themselves an advantage of a few seconds over viewers of the slightly delayed TV broadcast. In modern frantic markets, seconds can matter. The misuse of the audio feed by an unnamed third-party supplier is “wholly unacceptable”, said the Bank after the report by the Times. The governor, Mark Carney, will be squirming with embarrassment. He arrived in 2013 on a mission to modernise the Bank’s operations and information security was top of the list. Now Threadneedle Street stands accused of gross naivety. The audio feed was designed as a back-up in case the TV system failed, but the potential for mischief should have been obvious. The Bank left a back door, if not wide open, then significantly ajar. The call for somebody’s resignation will be loud. No hedge fund or trader, it should be said, had advance knowledge of the Bank’s actual policy decisions, which are the main event on these stage-managed occasions. Interest rate decisions, for example, are announced to the world on the stroke of midday, and the full set of accompanying documents is published simultaneously. Journalists are allowed to read the contents in advance only if they are locked in the bowels of the Bank until midday in a secure room with no wifi or mobile phone signal. The security breach concerns only the press conferences, which start at 12.30pm. A consolation for the Bank, one could argue, is that Carney’s press conferences tend to be spectacularly dull. He’s in the business of explaining reports that are in the public domain by the time he speaks and he tends not to stray far from his mental script. For ordinary mortals, a five-second informational advantage might be useless. Even five minutes to wade through Carney’s sub-clauses might not yield nuggets to indicate if the pound should be moving up, down or sideways.","It is very hard to steal gold from the Bank of England. But something bad happened with the Bank's security. This happened in the time of computers and information.

Some groups that manage money, called hedge funds, got secret access. They could listen to the Bank governor's talks before everyone else. They heard the talks a few seconds before people watching TV.

In today's fast markets, even a few seconds can be important. A company gave the hedge funds this secret audio feed. The Bank of England said this was ""not okay.""

The Bank governor, Mark Carney, may feel bad. He came to the Bank to make things better. He wanted to improve how the Bank keeps information safe. Now, people think the Bank was not careful enough.

The audio feed was meant to be a backup. It was for times when the TV system did not work. But the Bank should have known this could cause problems. The Bank left a small way for people to get secret information.

People may ask someone to leave their job because of this. It is important to know that the hedge funds did not know the Bank's plans ahead of time. The Bank makes important decisions at these talks. For example, they talk about interest rates.

These decisions are announced at 12:00. All the important papers are shared at the same time. Reporters can read these papers early. But they must stay in a safe room at the Bank. They cannot use phones or the internet until 12:00.

The security problem was only with the press talks. These talks start at 12:30. The Bank may be happy about one thing. The governor's talks are often boring. He talks about reports that everyone can already read. He usually says what he planned to say.

For most people, getting information five seconds early is not helpful. Even having five minutes to read what the governor says might not help. It might not tell you if the British money will go up or down."
62,62_1,1,"The trouble is, there is a breed of hedge funds that does not operate like ordinary mortals do. They’re pursuing fast action and even the possibility of morsels of information count in their world. Some even run artificial intelligence computer programmes to alight on specific words or phrases and then trade instantly, and perhaps only for a brief second, on what they learn. This type of hedge fund may also be interested in what Carney doesn’t say, as much as what he does, in response to a question. Such strategies seek only marginal gains, and success is clearly not guaranteed, but a central bank simply cannot give anybody any theoretical opportunity to get ahead of the market. The fallout from this affair will be fascinating. The Financial Conduct Authority will have to decide if the third-party supplier (which surely won’t remain unidentified for long) has merely breached its contract with the Bank or has committed market abuse, which is a serious regulatory matter. The market abuse question also applies to the hedge funds, though the FCA will face an obvious difficulty in proving that a trade was placed because of access to the audio feed rather than something unrelated. This could be groundbreaking territory. The judgment on the Bank of England, by contrast, is already clear. It looks amateurish.","Some hedge funds are different. They do not work like normal people. They want to act very fast. Even small pieces of information are important to them.

Some use computers with artificial intelligence. These computers look for certain words or phrases. When they find them, they trade quickly. They might only trade for a very short time.

These hedge funds might watch what someone *doesn't* say. They pay attention to what someone does and doesn't say in response to a question.

These funds want to make small profits. They might not always succeed. But a central bank should not give anyone a chance to get ahead in the market.

What happens next will be interesting. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will look into what happened. They will decide if the company that gave the information broke its contract with the Bank of England.

They will also see if the company did something illegal called ""market abuse."" Market abuse is a serious problem.

The FCA will also look at the hedge funds. It will be hard to prove that a trade happened because of the information. It might have happened for another reason.

This could be a new situation for the FCA.

We already know what we think about the Bank of England. They look like they made a mistake. It looks unprofessional."
63,63_0,0,"Saturday was not so super for retailers last weekend, as numbers visiting high streets and shopping centres fell by nearly 8% compared with the previous year. With some retailers accepting online orders as late as Christmas Eve, shoppers now have many more choices about the way they shop and often hang on for last-minute bargains. More than a third (36%) of Brits have left gift-buying until the last few days before Christmas, according to Argos. It said 10% more men than women leave gift-buying until very late, with the most popular gift bought in its stores on Christmas Eve last year being an electric toothbrush. John Lewis expected novelty socks and gadgets such as airpods and smart speakers to be its most popular last-minute items. Monday was expected to be the busiest day for food retailers with Waitrose expecting to sell 214,000kg of sprouts in the final days before Christmas and 250% more quails eggs than usual. The lower turnout recorded by shopper monitoring firm Springboard on Saturday –traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year – came despite a flurry of discounts from retailers in an effort to tempt bargain hunters after a difficult trading year. Industry experts said the plethora of promotions on offer since November, and particularly over the Black Friday discount period at the end of November, meant many had spent their money early or were underwhelmed by further price cuts. Late last week Topshop and Miss Selfridge increased their discounts to up to 60%, from 40% and 50% respectively earlier in the week, while Jigsaw, Peacocks and House of Fraser increased their price cuts to 50%, matching Debenhams, Hobbs and Oasis, which had deepened their discounts. Marks &amp; Spencer also added knitwear to its price-cutting pile, offering 40% off its key seasonal category, as well as a half-price on beauty gifts offer. The difficult trading is expected to bring further distress for retailers in early 2020 after numerous administrations and store closures this year. The number of retailers in financial distress in the final quarter of the year has risen 1.4% on the same period last year to 27,000, according to data from the corporate recovery firm Begbies Traynor. Fashion chains are among the worst affected, with the number in distress increasing by 21% in the past three years to 3,355.","Last Saturday was not a good day for shops. Fewer people went to the shops compared to last year. About 8% fewer people visited the streets and shopping centers.

Shops now take orders online until Christmas Eve. So, people have more ways to shop. They often wait for the last-minute sales.

Argos says that more than one third of British people buy gifts just before Christmas. That is about 36%. Men are more likely than women to wait until the last minute. Last year, the most popular gift at Argos on Christmas Eve was an electric toothbrush.

John Lewis thought that fun socks and gadgets would be popular. Gadgets like airpods and smart speakers.

Monday was expected to be very busy for food shops. Waitrose thought they would sell a lot of sprouts. About 214,000 kg of sprouts! They also thought they would sell more quails eggs. About 250% more than usual.

Springboard watches how many people go to shops. They said fewer people went shopping on Saturday. Saturday is usually a very busy shopping day. Shops offered many discounts to try to get people to buy things. They wanted to attract people after a hard year for sales.

Experts said that shops had many sales since November. Black Friday was at the end of November. Because of these sales, people had already spent their money. Or they were not interested in more sales.

Last week, some shops had bigger discounts. Topshop and Miss Selfridge had discounts of up to 60%. Before, they were 40% and 50%. Other shops like Jigsaw, Peacocks, and House of Fraser also had bigger discounts. They offered 50% off, like Debenhams, Hobbs, and Oasis.

Marks & Spencer also had sales. They offered 40% off knitwear. This is an important thing to sell at this time of year. They also had half-price beauty gifts.

Shops have not been doing well. This could cause problems for shops in 2020. Some shops may close.

Begbies Traynor is a company that helps businesses. They say that many shops are having financial problems. The number of shops in trouble has increased by 1.4% compared to last year. About 27,000 shops are in trouble.

Fashion shops are having the most problems. The number of fashion shops in trouble has increased by 21% in the last three years. About 3,355 fashion shops are struggling."

64,64_0,0,"The Bank of England restructured its security department and lost multiple senior employees in charge of protecting some of Britain’s most critical financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal. After the central bank admitted that hedge funds had gained early access to its market-moving press conferences via a backup audio feed, multiple former employees contacted the Observer to warn that the Bank was struggling with the departure of key staff responsible for protecting it against external threats. The sources said at least 20 of the Bank’s staff tasked with information security had left or been reassigned elsewhere within the bank within the past year, raising questions over the protection of the nation’s payment systems and other critical infrastructure vital for the British financial system. The Observer was able to verify 13 of these departures using information from social media and other sources. The revelations come at a sensitive time for the Bank as it prepares for the handover of power in March from Mark Carney, the outgoing governor, to Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Threadneedle Street has also played a central role in efforts to improve the safety and integrity of the financial system since the 2008 banking collapse, including warning the industry to improve its cyber and information security operations. It is responsible for key parts of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including the payments systems that carry every bank transfer made in Britain, the wages of millions of people, cheques, and payments between businesses of all sizes. On an average day in 2018, the Bank’s real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) settled transactions worth £651bn. According to the former employees, the Bank’s chief information security officer and two deputies have left in the past year. Multiple former employees described the organisation as beset by budget cuts before Carney’s departure, against a backdrop of concerns over cost efficiency. They said there were problems with staffing given the departures and low staff morale. Much of the disquiet stemmed from a move to dismantle the Bank’s “security and privacy” directorate, the people said. The team, part of the central services division, previously had oversight over cyber, personnel and physical security matters, as well as privacy. Staff and responsibilities were instead spread across other parts of the organisation.","The Bank of England changed its security team. Some important people who protected Britain's money systems left their jobs. This happened before a big problem at the Bank.

The Bank said that some hedge funds got important news early. They heard press conferences before everyone else. This happened because of a copy of the sound.

After this, some people who used to work at the Bank spoke to a newspaper called the Observer. They said the Bank was having problems because important security people were leaving. These people were in charge of keeping the Bank safe from outside dangers.

The people said that at least 20 security staff left or moved to other jobs in the Bank. This happened in the last year. This makes people worry about the safety of Britain's money systems. These systems are very important for the British economy.

The Observer checked and found that 13 people had left. They used information from social media and other places.

This news is happening at an important time. The head of the Bank, Mark Carney, is leaving in March. Andrew Bailey will take over from him.

The Bank of England has been working to make the money system safer since 2008. They have told banks to improve their computer security.

The Bank is in charge of important things like the system that moves money between banks. This system pays wages, processes checks, and pays businesses.

In 2018, this system moved about £651 billion every day.

The people who used to work at the Bank said that the head of security and two helpers left in the last year.

They said the Bank had less money to spend before Mark Carney left. They were worried about saving money. They also said there were not enough people working there, and the staff were not happy.

A lot of the problem was because the Bank changed its ""security and privacy"" team. This team used to look after computer security, staff security, building security, and privacy. Now, the people and their jobs are spread out in other parts of the Bank."
64,64_1,1,"It is understood that many of the people now sit under the Bank’s technology, security and risk directorates, in a move designed to make the organisation safer. The Bank has about 70 cybersecurity professionals. A Bank of England spokeswoman said: “The Bank operates the highest standard of information security and is confident in our ability to recognise cyber threats and defend our systems appropriately. Earlier this year, the Bank completed a review of its central services target operating model and, as part of that, reinforced the arrangements for first- and second-line information security. This change was fully supported by the Bank’s audit and risk committee.” The Bank admitted late on Wednesday night that it had suffered a security breach, with a provider of a backup audio feed of the governor’s market-sensitive press conferences selling early access to unnamed investors without its knowledge. Those investors could have used the few seconds’ advantage to profit. It was alerted to the breach by the Times newspaper, conducted a rapid internal investigation and passed the matter to the FCA. The City watchdog has confirmed it is investigating the issue, and it is understood that Bailey will recuse himself from all discussions of the matter to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest. The Bank’s chief operating officer, Joanna Place, is the most senior manager responsible for physical and information security, and faced calls to resign from a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, Danny Blanchflower, following the breach. Place, who was appointed in July 2017, reports directly to the governor, and has an equal status to the Bank’s deputy governors. Multiple sources said the Bank was under pressure to cut the budget of the central services division, which was managed by Place. They said the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned in December 2018 that the Bank needed to deliver better value for money. Place told the Commons’ public accounts committee in January that the Bank did not “have any gaps in cybersecurity”. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, resigned little over a month later. Multiple other security experts followed him. A spokeswoman for the Bank said Rogers resigned on 23 February and that Place was not aware he was going to quit when she gave evidence on 21 January.","Many people who work with technology, security, and risk now work together. This is to make the Bank safer. The Bank has about 70 people who work on computer security.

A person from the Bank of England said that the Bank has very good information security. They are sure they can find computer threats and protect their systems.

Earlier this year, the Bank checked how its services work. They made the information security stronger. The Bank's audit group agreed with this change.

The Bank said on Wednesday night that there was a security problem. A company that gave a backup of the Governor's speeches sold early access to some investors. The Bank did not know about this. The speeches could change the market.

These investors could have used this early information to make money. They had a few seconds advantage.

The Times newspaper told the Bank about the problem. The Bank quickly checked what happened. Then they told the FCA about it. The FCA is a group that watches over the City.

The FCA said they are looking into the problem. The head of the Bank, Bailey, will not talk about this. This is to avoid any problems with fairness.

Joanna Place is in charge of security at the Bank. She is the most important manager for physical and information security. Danny Blanchflower, who used to work at the Bank, said she should leave her job after the security problem.

Place started her job in July 2017. She reports to the Governor. She has the same level of power as the Deputy Governors.

Some people said the Bank had to spend less money on the central services division. Place managed this division.

In December 2018, the National Audit Office said the Bank needed to spend money better. The National Audit Office watches how the government spends money.

In January, Place said that the Bank was good at computer security. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, left his job a little later.

Other security experts also left.

A person from the Bank said that Rogers left on February 23. Place did not know he was leaving when she spoke in January."
64,64_2,2,"At the hearing, Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, expressed surprise at Place’s answer, given the difficulties other public-sector organisations had with recruiting and retaining cyber security staff, and asked again if there were any vacancies. Place responded: “Offhand, I do not know whether we have any vacancies, but we do not have a problem with recruiting and we do not have a problem with retention in cyber, either.” There was widespread unease within the Bank following her testimony, multiple sources said, and in the months after her appearance the cybersecurity function suffered the outflow of staff. The public sector struggles to retain staff in cybersecurity roles because of intense competition from the higher-paying private sector. However, the reputation of the Bank and its important role in protecting financial stability are attractive for potential candidates, and the sources said they believed it was in the public interest to shed light on the problems it was facing. A Bank of England spokesperson said: “The incident relating to the misuse of a backup audio feed from the Bank’s press conferences by a third-party supplier, which the Bank has referred to the Financial Conduct Authority for further investigation, was not a cyber security issue.”","Here's the rewritten text at a B2 CEFR level:

Meg Hillier was the leader of a group called the committee. She was surprised by what Place said at a meeting.

Other groups that work for the government have problems finding and keeping cyber security workers. Meg Hillier asked Place if there were any jobs open.

Place said she didn't know if there were open jobs. She said they were able to find and keep cyber security workers easily.

But some people in the Bank were worried after she spoke. They said many cyber security workers left the Bank in the months after.

It is hard for government groups to keep cyber security workers. This is because private companies pay more money.

The Bank is known for its important work. It helps keep the financial system safe. Some people thought it was important to talk about the problems at the Bank. They hoped it would help.

A person from the Bank of England said something happened with a company that recorded sound. This company used a backup recording from the Bank's press events in a wrong way. The Bank told the Financial Conduct Authority to look into this. The Bank said this was not a cyber security problem."
65,65_0,0,"UK high streets have shed more than 140,000 jobs this year as store closures and retail failures made 2019 one of the most challenging years in a generation. More than 2,750 jobs were lost every week, according to a detailed analysis by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) published today. It predicts the picture will worsen in 2020, unless the government intervenes, with high business rates one of the factors blamed for accelerating chain store closures. Prof Joshua Bamfield, the CRR’s director, said retail was in crisis owing to high costs, low levels of profitability and sales moving online. “These problems are felt by most businesses operating from physical stores in high streets or shopping malls,” Bamfield said. “The low growth in consumer spending since 2015 has meant that the growth in online sales has come at the expense of the high street.” The CRR said 38,100 of the jobs lost this year were down to retail chains going bust with Karen Millen and Coast among 2019’s high profile casualties. Another 26,500 roles were shed through company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a controversial insolvency procedure that has been used by the likes of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group and Debenhams to shed loss-making stores. Another 78,600 jobs were axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small shops simply shutting for good. Marks &amp; Spencer is among the big names closing stores while House of Fraser, which is part of Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, has also been shutting outlets. A total of 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019, according to CRR’s calculations, up by more than a fifth on 2018’s 117,400. The CRR also calculated that 16,073 shops closed around the UK in 2019, or around 61 every working day. That was an increase on the 14,583 shops which closed in 2018. A separate study looking at how the UK labour market had changed over the past decade said the rise of online shopping had eliminated 289,000 “traditional” high street roles. Eight out of 10 of these entry-level retail jobs – positions like sales assistant and checkout operator – were held by women, according to the RSA Future Work Centre.","In the UK, many shops in town centers are closing. This is causing people to lose their jobs.

This year, more than 140,000 people have lost their jobs because shops are closing. 2019 has been a very difficult year for shops.

A group called the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) looked at this problem. They found that about 2,750 jobs were lost each week.

The CRR thinks things will get worse in 2020. They say the government needs to help. One problem is that shops have to pay high business rates. This makes it hard for them to stay open.

Prof Joshua Bamfield is the director of the CRR. He said that shops are in trouble. They have to pay a lot of money, but they do not make much profit. Also, more people are shopping online.

Mr. Bamfield said that many shops in town centers and shopping malls are having problems. People are not spending much money in shops. Instead, they are buying things online. This hurts the shops.

The CRR said that 38,100 jobs were lost because some big shops closed down. Karen Millen and Coast were two of these shops.

Also, some companies used a special plan to close shops that were losing money. This plan is called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group and Debenhams used this plan. This caused another 26,500 people to lose their jobs.

Another 78,600 jobs were lost because shops cut costs. Some big shops closed stores. Other small shops closed down completely. Marks & Spencer is one big shop that is closing stores. House of Fraser is also closing stores.

In total, 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019. This is more than in 2018. In 2018, 117,400 jobs were lost.

The CRR also said that 16,073 shops closed in the UK in 2019. This is about 61 shops every working day. This is more than in 2018. In 2018, 14,583 shops closed.

Another study looked at how the job market in the UK has changed in the last 10 years. It said that online shopping has caused 289,000 ""traditional"" jobs in town centers to disappear.

These jobs include jobs like sales assistant and checkout operator. Most of these jobs were done by women. A group called the RSA Future Work Centre found that women held eight out of ten of these jobs."
65,65_1,1,"The thinktank is part of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the charity run by Matthew Taylor who authored a gig economy review for Theresa May when she was prime minister. Alan Lockey, who heads the thinktank, said: “The carnage on the high street has hollowed out many jobs traditionally held by women, but areas of growth related to e-commerce, such as van driving, are going more to men. This is having a profound effect on individuals, families and society.” Today one in every five pounds spent at the shops is online – more than double the level at the start of the decade. The resulting shift in labour markets are stark. There are now 166,000 fewer check-out staff, shelf fillers and sales assistants than at the start of the 2010s, according to RSA’s analysis of official employment data, while the pool of bank and post office clerks has shrunk by 65,000 as branches closed. By comparison there are 102,000 more van drivers and 161,000 more administration roles. Lockey said the decline of the high street was the most dramatic factor affecting the UK’s jobs landscape, even though austerity, which had eliminated 109,000 public sector administrators, also loomed large. Despite the reckoning taking place the retail sector remains the UK’s biggest private sector employer with a workforce of around 3 million. Its decline contrasts with a wider picture showing record levels of employment as former shop workers find alternative work in restaurants, hotels and as care workers. The RSA study showed a near 78,000 rise in the number of care workers. “The employment figures show that over the last decade the economy has been good at creating jobs but low skilled workers in the retail sector have been pushed from pillar to post. The alternative jobs they are getting are often low paid and do not provide good security, leading to working poverty,” Lockey added. The important Christmas trading period appears to have brought little respite for struggling retail chains. Trading during November and December was marred by heavy discounting as stores sought to tempt out shoppers put off by the uncertainty around Brexit and the 12 December general election. The post-Christmas sales got off to a disappointing start too, attracting smaller crowds than in previous years.","This group does research. It is part of a bigger organization called the Royal Society for the Arts. Matthew Taylor leads this organization. He wrote a report about the ""gig economy"" for Theresa May when she was the leader of the country.

Alan Lockey is in charge of the research group. He said that many shops are closing. This means women are losing jobs. But new jobs are being created because of online shopping. These jobs, like driving vans, are often going to men. This change is bad for people, families, and the whole country.

Now, people spend more money online. They spend twice as much as they did ten years ago. This has changed the job market a lot.

There are now fewer people working as check-out staff and sales assistants. About 166,000 jobs are gone since 2010. Also, many banks and post offices have closed. This means 65,000 fewer people work there.

But there are more van drivers. About 102,000 more. And there are 161,000 more jobs in offices.

Alan Lockey said that the closing of shops is a big problem for jobs in the UK. The government also cut spending. This caused 109,000 jobs to be lost in government offices.

Even though many shops are closing, the retail business is still big in the UK. About 3 million people work in shops.

The number of jobs in shops is going down. But in general, there are many jobs in the UK. People who used to work in shops are now working in restaurants, hotels, or as care workers. The research showed that there are almost 78,000 more care workers.

Alan Lockey said that the UK has created many jobs in the last ten years. But people who had simple jobs in shops are losing them. The new jobs they get often do not pay well. These jobs are not secure. This means people can be poor even when they are working.

The time around Christmas is important for shops. But this year, shops did not do very well. They had big sales in November and December. They hoped to get people to shop because people were worried about Brexit and the election. The sales after Christmas also did not go well. Fewer people went shopping than in other years."
66,66_0,0,"The embattled US aircraft maker Boeing has reportedly sent US regulators “troubling communications” related to the development of the 737 MAX – on the same day that the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was forced to step aside. According to a senior Boeing executive, the documents include new messages from Mark Forkner, a senior company test pilot who complained of “egregious” erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of Boeing’s MCAS anti-stall system, and referred to “Jedi mind tricks” to persuade regulators to approve the plane. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Seattle Times that the Forkner communications contain the same kind of “trash talking” about Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulators as the earlier messages released in October. The release is likely to deepen the sense of crisis enveloping Boeing, which has taken more than $8bn in costs and lost more than 20% of its market value since the 737 variant was grounded in March following two crashes. Last week, the company said it would temporarily halt production of the troubled jet. Forkner, meanwhile, has reportedly hired his own criminal defense lawyers and invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid turning over records to the US Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal inquiry into the company’s handling of the 737 Max’s development. It was Forkner who requested that information about MCAS be omitted from flight manuals and pilot training, rendering the pilots of both the doomed Lion Air and Ethiopian flights helpless when the system kicked in, pushing the plane’s nose down repeatedly until they ultimately lost control. But the timing of the latest information release is likely to increase anger surrounding Boeing’s handling of the crisis, even as a new CEO, David Calhoun, takes the reins early next year. In a statement released on Monday, Boeing said that under the “new leadership”, Boeing “will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA, other global regulators and its customers”. But the latest drop of documents could complicate those intentions, and further challenge its relationship with regulators.","Boeing is a company that makes airplanes. They are having problems with one of their planes, the 737 MAX.

Boeing sent some messages to the people who check if planes are safe. These messages were not good. They were about how the 737 MAX was made.

At the same time, the boss of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, had to leave his job.

A person who works at Boeing said that the messages were from Mark Forkner. Mark Forkner is a pilot who tests planes.

Mark Forkner said that the plane did not work well in tests. He talked about a system on the plane called MCAS. This system is supposed to stop the plane from going up too high.

Forkner also talked about using ""Jedi mind tricks"" to get the people who check planes to say the plane was okay.

The person who works at Boeing did not want to give their name. They said that Forkner's messages were like bad talk about the people who check planes.

This news makes the problems for Boeing even worse. The problems started when the 737 MAX had two crashes. Many people died in these crashes.

Because of the crashes, the 737 MAX planes are not allowed to fly. This has cost Boeing a lot of money. The company has also lost some of its value.

Last week, Boeing said they will stop making the 737 MAX for a while.

Mark Forkner has hired lawyers. He does not want to give information to the government. The government is checking if Boeing did anything wrong when they made the 737 MAX.

Forkner asked for information about MCAS to be left out of the books that pilots use. This means the pilots did not know about the system. When the system turned on in the two planes that crashed, the pilots could not control the planes.

Now, these new messages have come out. This will make people even more angry at Boeing.

A new boss, David Calhoun, will start at Boeing next year.

Boeing said that with the new boss, they will be open and honest. They will talk to the people who check planes and their customers.

But these new messages might make things difficult for Boeing. It might be harder for them to work with the people who check planes."
66,66_1,1,"The aerospace giant already angered the FAA by failing to turn over the Forkner messages for eight months because of the criminal investigation into how the plane was originally approved for service. “The FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery,” the regulator said in a statement on 18 October. The regulator was also reportedly further vexed by Muilenburg’s predictions that the 737 Max would imminently be cleared to return to service, which it regarded as placing pressure on the agency to approve Boeing’s MCAS software fix even as it was taking a hit to its reputation for being too cozy with the plane maker. Last month, Muilenburg was reportedly called to a meeting in Washington with the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, and dressed down for applying perceived pressure on the regulator. An internal FAA memo written by Dickson and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, said the FAA would not work to any schedule. Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020. Muilenburg’s efforts to take responsibility for the 737 debacle, and to apologize for its tragic consequences, fell flat with lawmakers, the public and grieving families, costing him his job. During congressional testimony, Muilenburg offered muddled responses to lawmaker’s demands for clarity on the development and approval of the 737 Max, and why it had not been immediately grounded after the first crash in Indonesia. “You’re not trying to Jedi mind-trick us here today on this committee?” the Democrat Dina Titus challenged. Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to receive $26.5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package. His payout could reach as high as $58.5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 annually and Boeing stock worth another $13.3m. In a statement on Monday, Boeing’s board said it had decided that “a change in leadership” was necessary to restore confidence. But it chose not to fire the executive, allowing him to keep his pay package and saving Boeing from the impression its most senior executive had done something wrong.","Boeing is a very big company that makes airplanes. Boeing made the FAA (a government group) angry. This happened because Boeing did not give the FAA some messages for eight months. These messages were about how the 737 Max plane was first approved. The FAA said they were not happy that Boeing did not show them the messages right away.

The head of Boeing, Mr. Muilenburg, said the 737 Max would fly again soon. The FAA did not like this. They thought Mr. Muilenburg was trying to make them approve the plane's new software quickly. The FAA did not want to seem like they were too friendly with Boeing.

Mr. Muilenburg met with the head of the FAA in Washington. He was told not to put pressure on the FAA. The FAA said they would not let the 737 Max fly until 2020. They would not follow any schedule.

Mr. Muilenburg tried to say he was sorry for the problems with the 737 Max. He also apologized for the people who died. But many people were still not happy. These included politicians, the public, and the families of the people who died. He lost his job because of this.

Politicians asked Mr. Muilenburg many questions about the 737 Max. They wanted to know why it was not stopped from flying after the first crash. One politician asked him if he was trying to trick them.

Mr. Muilenburg is 55 years old. He will get $26.5 million when he leaves Boeing. He could get even more money, maybe $58.5 million. This includes money for retirement and stocks.

Boeing said they needed a new leader to make people trust them again. They did not fire Mr. Muilenburg. This means he gets to keep his money. Boeing did not want it to look like he did something wrong."
66,66_2,2,"But according to subsequent reports, it was not just the handling of 737 Max crisis or squabbles with the FAA that ultimately doomed Muilenburg. Last week, a high-profile launch of Boeing’s space capsule went awry.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at CEFR B2 level:

The reports came later. They said more than just the 737 Max problems caused problems for Muilenburg. It wasn't only arguments with the FAA either. Something else went wrong. Last week, Boeing launched a new space capsule. This launch was very important. But it did not go as planned."

I make no apology for having devoted so many columns to what on Thursday became the lost cause of Remain. The pro-European cause in this country has, alas, suffered from a colossal failure of leadership. The failure to make the case for our EU membership goes back a long way, as does the drip-drip of the vile anti-European campaign in the Murdoch press, and the obvious suspects in other sections of the media. The sequence of events was well brought out in Denis MacShane’s prophetic book Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe in 2015. (What lies in store is outlined both in MacShane’s latest volume, Brexiternity, and Sir Ivan Rogers’s recent magisterial lecture at Glasgow University.) As MacShane wrote in 2015: “The referendum on Europe is not on the benefits or cost of EU membership, but a wider protest about economic and social change which appears inside Britain to produce as many losers as winners.” It was always easy to blame “Brussels” for policies that became controversial, even when those policies were initiated by successive UK governments themselves. One of the leading perpetrators of lies about Europe was, of course, the Telegraph’s former Brussels correspondent himself: Boris Johnson. Johnson is such a master of what his putative hero Winston Churchill called “terminological inexactitudes” that nothing he claimed during the campaign or the morning of his victory can be taken at face value. “One-nation Conservatism”? Governing for the interests of those northerners who have “lent him their votes”? Pull the other one! How does that compare with his plans for deregulation, closer alignment with Trump’s America, and the opportunities for profiting from Brexit to which his financial backers look forward? As Rogers said in his Glasgow lecture, Johnson’s claim that we will “not suffer any downside in terms of market access into easily our biggest market for goods and services … is clearly untrue. It does not get any truer through endless repetition.” The nation has been the victim of a gigantic con trick on the part of the Leave campaign.","The Chinese have a saying: ""Be careful what you wish for."" I have a similar saying: ""Be careful who you vote for.""

I wrote a lot about why Britain should stay in the EU. On Thursday, it seemed like we lost. The people who wanted Britain to stay in the EU did not lead very well.

For a long time, they did not explain why being in the EU was good. Also, some newspapers and other media wrote bad things about the EU.

Denis MacShane wrote a book in 2015. It was called ""Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe."" The book said what would happen if Britain left the EU. MacShane also wrote another book called ""Brexiternity."" Ivan Rogers also gave a speech about Brexit at Glasgow University. These books and speeches tell us what to expect.

MacShane wrote that the vote about the EU was not just about money. It was also about people being unhappy with changes in Britain. Some people felt they were losing because of these changes.

It was easy to blame the EU for things people did not like. But sometimes, the British government started those things.

Boris Johnson used to write about the EU for a newspaper. He told lies about the EU. He is good at saying things that are not completely true. So, you cannot believe everything he said during the campaign or after he won.

He says he wants to help everyone in Britain. He says he wants to help people in the north who voted for him. But that might not be true. He wants to change the rules. He wants to be closer to America. He wants his rich friends to make money from Brexit.

Rogers said that Johnson is wrong to say Britain will not lose anything by leaving the EU. He said that Britain will lose access to the EU market. The EU is where Britain sells most of its goods and services. Saying something over and over does not make it true.

The Leave campaign tricked the nation. They did not tell the truth about what would happen."
67,67_1,1,"The nonsensical propaganda about “getting Brexit done” was finally too much for the counsellor in the British embassy in Washington who resigned recently because she could no longer face peddling a misleading line. But back to failures of leadership: Jeremy Corbyn’s failure was on an epic scale. Reputedly a Leaver himself, he made a huge mistake in thinking that, by equivocating over the referendum, he could somehow please those supposedly natural Labour voters in the Midlands and the north who had voted Leave in the referendum. The election showed that too many of them merely laughed in his face. It seems that the election was also a referendum on Corbyn. There has been, and will continue to be, endless speculation about the reasons why the electorate distrusted him even more than Johnson. But historically there seems to me a simple, fundamental cause, whatever the deficiencies in Corbyn personally. In the early 1980s the sensible centre of the Labour party fought the extreme left – then known as the Militant Tendency, not Momentum – and saw them off. The late Denis Healey played a crucial role, as did Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley. And the moderate left in Britain and continental Europe watched the failure of President Mitterrand’s experiment with “socialism in one country” between 1981 and 1983 and learned the lesson. Among those who learned the lesson was Mitterrand himself. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also took note. Alas, this time the extreme left captured the Labour party, with the results we now see. For reasons that I fail to understand, Corbyn and his allies, such as Seumas Milne, believe that the EU is some kind of capitalist conspiracy. Despite the many doubts about Corbyn himself, if he had not equivocated and campaigned vigorously in favour of Remain and a referendum with no ifs or buts, there might well have been a hung parliament and deals which could have contained Corbyn’s wilder plans. Also, the hapless Jo Swinson should not have made the strategic mistake of ruling out the second referendum her party had previously espoused. However, we are where we are.","A British diplomat in Washington quit her job. She could not tell lies about ""Brexit"" anymore. She thought it was wrong to say Brexit was ""done.""

There were other problems with leaders. Jeremy Corbyn made a big mistake. He was the leader of the Labour party. Some people thought he wanted Brexit. He did not clearly say what he believed about Brexit.

He thought he could please everyone. Some Labour voters in the middle and north of England voted for Brexit. Corbyn thought he could keep them happy by not taking a clear side. But these voters did not trust him.

The election was also about Corbyn himself. People did not trust him as much as they did Boris Johnson.

There is a historical reason for this. In the 1980s, the Labour party fought against the far-left group. This group was called the Militant Tendency. People like Denis Healey, Neil Kinnock, and Roy Hattersley helped the Labour party win.

At the same time, people in Europe saw that socialism did not work in France. The French president, Mitterrand, tried it. He learned from his mistake. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also learned from this.

But this time, the far-left took over the Labour party. We can see the bad results now. Corbyn and his friends thought the EU was a trick by rich people. I do not understand why.

If Corbyn had supported staying in the EU, things might have been different. He could have asked for a second vote on Brexit. If he had done this clearly, there might have been no clear winner in the election. This could have stopped Corbyn's worst ideas.

Jo Swinson also made a mistake. She was the leader of another party. She said she would not have a second vote on Brexit. This was a bad choice. Her party had wanted a second vote before.

But now, we are where we are. Things have already happened."
67,67_2,2,"The Brexit and Conservative party is going to “deliver” Brexit. But so far from “getting Brexit done”, the election result means that Brexit has only just begun. Is the British public bored by Brexit talk? I am sorry, but there is a lot more boredom in store, and goodness knows how much economic damage from leaving the single market – the creation of which was, ironically, considered by Kenneth Clarke as Margaret Thatcher’s greatest achievement. Happy Christmas!","The Brexit party wants to finish Brexit. They say they will ""deliver"" it. But the election result means Brexit is not finished yet. It has only just started.

Are British people tired of hearing about Brexit? I think they are. But there will be much more talk about Brexit.

Leaving the single market will hurt the economy. We do not know how much it will hurt. Kenneth Clarke thought creating the single market was Margaret Thatcher's best thing. That is funny because now they want to leave it.

Happy Christmas!"
68,68_0,0,"As we wrap up the year, I thought it would be fun to look back at all the columns I have written for the Guardian and pull out the five stories that were my favorites. Why are these my favorites? Mostly because these stories captured the best and worst aspects of running a small business this year. Female-owned businesses: the US economy’s quiet success story A report earlier this year found that 42% of all firms are female-owned and women started 1,817 businesses a day in the past year. My daughter is currently watching Mad Men for the first time and was shocked at how women were treated in the workplace a mere 50 years ago. To me, that just shows how much things have changed. Unfortunately – as I also wrote here – the out-of-date attitudes of some men in positions of power continue to challenge female advancement and opportunities in the workplace. But, there’s still been a lot of progress. As I wrote: “The fact is that women have made significant gains not only in the workplace but in entrepreneurship. Of course there is still a long way to go to achieve equality. But, compared with the data from 10 or 20 years before, there’s no dispute that the environment continues to improve.” Unlimited vacation isn’t as crazy as it sounds – and it can save you money I like reporting on small business news, but I also enjoy sharing good tactics that can help small business owners grow. One of these tactics involves unlimited vacation. 2019 was a year of very tight unemployment and just about every small business owner I know struggled to find and keep good employees. So what about unlimited vacation? Don’t laugh. My report found that unlimited vacation plans can be a potential great benefit and not as costly or as risky as they may seem. As I wrote: “... the vacation benefits you offer should best suit the interests of your employees and your company’s culture. An unlimited paid time-off plan may not be the right thing for your business. But considering some of the potential financial benefits, you should at least be seriously considering it.” Could this be the worst cafe in the world? I know I’m supposed to cover American businesses, but this little restaurant in an out-of-the-way place in New Zealand was too irresistible to ignore. “Just how bad is the customer service at the Springfield Store and Cafe?” I wrote.","The year is ending. I want to talk about my favorite stories from my articles in the Guardian.

These stories are special to me. They show the good and bad parts of having a small business this year.

One story is about businesses owned by women. These businesses are doing well in the US. A report said that women own 42% of all businesses. Women started many new businesses every day last year.

My daughter is watching a TV show called Mad Men. It shows how women were treated at work 50 years ago. My daughter was surprised. This shows how much things have changed for women.

But, some men in power still have old ideas. This makes it hard for women to get better jobs. However, women have made progress.

I wrote that women have done well at work and in business. We still need to work towards equality. But things are better than 10 or 20 years ago.

Another story is about unlimited vacation. This might sound strange, but it can save money. I like to write about news for small businesses. I also like to share ideas that can help them grow.

One idea is to offer unlimited vacation. In 2019, it was hard to find workers. Many small businesses could not find or keep good employees.

Unlimited vacation can be a good thing. It might not be as expensive or risky as you think.

I wrote that the vacation benefits should fit your workers and your business. Unlimited vacation might not be right for everyone. But you should think about it because it can save money.

Another story is about a bad cafe. I usually write about American businesses. But this cafe in New Zealand was too interesting to ignore.

I wrote, ""How bad is the customer service at the Springfield Store and Cafe?"""
68,68_1,1,"“So bad that people have been reportedly chased out of the cafe and others were forced to leave in tears after being abused by staff members. So bad that the police have actually been called and so bad that some of the local residents boycott the restaurant. ‘It’s an embarrassment to our community,’ one resident said. ‘You don’t have to talk to too many people before you come across somebody who’s had a bad experience there. I want them gone – the whole town wants them gone.’” But what’s interesting is that the cafe continues to thrive. Why? It has decent food and its owner’s behavior draws curiosity. Sometimes even poorly run businesses can succeed, despite their best efforts to fail. Why ‘Slutty Vegan’ became a hit in Atlanta – a city known for its barbecue Speaking of peculiar businesses, this one caught my attention last January because what kind of crazy person sells vegan food in the epicenter of barbecue, Atlanta, Georgia? And kills it! It’s a smart entrepreneur named Pinky Cole, a food truck owner who opened her first brick-and-mortar vegan eatery called Slutty Vegan at the beginning of the year and saw more than 1,200 people line up outside its doors on its very first day. Combining great food with an even better name, Cole’s restaurant has been a hit in 2019, attracting celebrities such as Shaquille O’Neal. She’s also laying the plans for more locations in 2020. No, she will never get me to stop eating meat – but I have to admit it will be tough to resist a Fussy Hussy (it consists of a plant-based patty with vegan cheese, shredded lettuce, onion, pickle and vegan mayo on a Hawaiian bun) the next time I’m in town. What’s the dynamic demographic running America’s small businesses? Older people OK Boomer, you’re still in charge. I’m thrilled for all the female entrepreneurs who are finally making their mark, but can we still give a small shoutout to us old people? The fact is that America’s small businesses are still dominated by people in their 50s and 60s, and if you’re marketing to small businesses, you best not ignore this demographic.","This cafe is very bad. Some people say staff were mean to them.
Some people had to leave the cafe crying. Other people say they were chased out.
The police were called to the cafe. Some people who live nearby do not go there anymore.

One person said the cafe is bad for the town. They said many people have had bad experiences there. This person wants the cafe to close. Many people in the town agree.

But the cafe is still doing well. This is interesting. The food is okay. The owner acts in a way that makes people curious. Sometimes, even bad businesses can do well.

Another interesting business is called ""Slutty Vegan."" It is in Atlanta. Atlanta is famous for its barbecue. So, why would someone sell vegan food there?

Pinky Cole is a smart business owner. She had a food truck. Then, she opened a restaurant called Slutty Vegan. On the first day, over 1,200 people waited in line to eat there.

The food is good, and the name is interesting. Celebrities like Shaquille O'Neal have eaten there. She plans to open more restaurants soon.

I will still eat meat. But the ""Fussy Hussy"" sandwich sounds good. It has vegan cheese, lettuce, onion, pickle, and vegan mayo on a sweet bun. I might try it next time I am in Atlanta.

Who owns most of the small businesses in America? It is mostly older people. People in their 50s and 60s own most small businesses. If you want to sell things to small businesses, remember this group of people."
68,68_2,2,"According to a survey, 57% of small business owners were born between 1946 and 1964. Sure, millennials are taking over the workplace and will very soon (thank goodness) take over the world. But that’s not going to happen right away and in the meantime it’s the boomers who are still running the majority of our country’s small businesses. I wish I had the time to include more, but there’s eggnog to consume. So for now, have a great new year and see you in 2020 with more stories about and for small business owners. It’s going to be a busy and interesting year for us all.","Here's the rewritten text in CEFR B2 level English, following your instructions:

A survey says something interesting. It says that many small business owners are from an older group. This group was born between 1946 and 1964.

Younger people, called millennials, are becoming more important at work. Soon, they might even be in charge of everything. But this will not happen very fast.

For now, the older group still runs most of the small businesses in our country.

I want to tell you more about this. But I don't have much time right now. I need to go and enjoy some eggnog!

I hope you have a good new year! I will see you in 2020. I will have more stories about small business owners then.

2020 will be a busy year for everyone. It will also be a very interesting year."
69,69_0,0,"In a parallel political universe, Ofwat’s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was announced on Monday. Incoming Labour ministers would instead be inspecting their soon-to-be nationalised assets. None of that will now happen, so the key issue in a still-privatised world is different. Will any of the companies that have bleated behind the scenes about a “politicised” regulatory process dare to allege unreasonable harshness on the part of Ofwat? Will any appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)? We’ll have to wait eight weeks – the permitted period for an appeal – to find out, but the likely suspects would be well advised to swallow their medicine. First, Ofwat’s review is pitched as the “toughest ever”, but so it had to be. Shareholders since privatisation in 1989 have enjoyed a dividend bonanza so this was always going to be a moment to lean in the opposite direction. That’s not evidence of politicisation; it’s just a recognition that regulation has been too lax. Ofwat’s new demands will strike most bill-payers as reasonable: lower returns on capital; a reduction in bills by £50 on average, ignoring inflation, over the next five years; and a 16% cut in leaks. Second, Ofwat has given some ground between its “draft” and “final” calculations. Companies, in aggregate, will be allowed about £1.5bn of extra expenditure to meet performance targets. The concession is not huge in the context of a £51bn spending programme, but it’s a softening. Third, the new regime will only look “tough” to the laggards, judged by efficiency. Note how the share price of Severn Trent, one of three companies that got top-of-the-class “fast track” status during Ofwat’s review, is within pennies of its all-time high. Its shareholders see little to frighten them. Fourth, an appeal to the CMA is not a one-way bet. The competition regulator is allowed to conclude that Ofwat should have been harder.","In another world, things might be different for water companies in England and Wales. The rules about how much they can charge customers would not matter. The Labour party would be in charge. They would be checking the water companies because they would own them.

But this did not happen. So, the important question is this: Will the water companies complain? They have said that the rules are unfair. Will they say that Ofwat, the water regulator, is too strict? Will they ask the CMA to look at the rules again? The CMA is another group that can check these things.

We must wait eight weeks to know for sure. The water companies have that much time to complain. But maybe it is better for them to accept the rules.

First, Ofwat says these new rules are the ""toughest ever."" They had to be strict. Since 1989, the people who own the water companies have made a lot of money. Now, things need to change. This is not unfair. It just means the rules were not strict enough before.

Most people who pay water bills will think the new rules are fair. The water companies will make less money. Bills will be about £50 lower each year for the next five years. This does not include changes because of inflation. Also, the companies must fix 16% more leaks.

Second, Ofwat has changed some things from their first plans. They will let the water companies spend about £1.5 billion more. This will help them meet the goals. This is not a lot of money compared to the £51 billion they will spend overall. But it is a small improvement for the companies.

Third, the new rules will only seem ""tough"" to the companies that are not doing well. The companies that are efficient will be fine. For example, Severn Trent is a good company. Ofwat said they were one of the best. Their stock price is very high. The people who own Severn Trent are not worried.

Fourth, asking the CMA for help is not a sure thing. The CMA could decide that Ofwat should have made even stricter rules."
69,69_1,1,"That thought ought to concentrate minds in the boardrooms of the four companies – Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames and Yorkshire – that are thought most likely to appeal. It’s time for them to accept that, in a privatised but regulated system, owners have to take a hit sometimes. On – then off – the buses It’s hard to keep up with transport firm FirstGroup’s view of its best strategy. Back in May, the “future emphasis” for the group was going to be First Student and First Transit, its two North American bus contractors, since they had “the greatest potential to generate sustainable value and growth over time”. Now both operations may be sold. What’s prompted the U-turn? One can point to the arrival of David Martin as chairman in August but, since he seemed to endorse the May vision only last month, the latest development looks to be a lobbying triumph for activist investor Coast Capital, aided these days by fellow investor Robert Tchenguiz. The duo demanded a sale of all US assets, not just the Greyhound coaching business, a few weeks ago; now they may get it. A UK-only future would be a mighty come-down for FirstGroup, which can currently call itself one of the world’s largest transport companies with 100,000 employees. Indeed, even within the UK, the future of the bus division is unclear, as FirstGroup is exploring what form of “separation” is possible while meeting pension obligations. If the buses were also to exit along with the US assets, all that would be left would be the UK rail business, from which FirstGroup seemed to be contemplating an orderly retreat only a year ago. Then it won the West Coast Partnership franchise and all is now apparently right with rail. One can view this strategic soul-searching as an exercise in “rationalisation”, the polite term for a break-up. It’s hard, though, to escape the feeling that there’s a simpler alternative to uncertain deal-making: just run the businesses better. Going up … ? Mike Ashley has been banging on about his “elevation” strategy for years and now he has something to show for it: a share price that elevated by 31% in a day. Context is everything, however.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

**Water Companies Need to Think**

Four water companies should think carefully. These companies are Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames, and Yorkshire. People think these companies are good choices to buy.

These companies need to understand something. They are private companies, but the government controls them. So, the owners may lose money sometimes. This is normal in this kind of system.

**FirstGroup Changes Its Mind**

It is difficult to understand what FirstGroup wants to do. FirstGroup is a transport company. In May, they said they would focus on two things. These were First Student and First Transit. They are bus companies in North America. FirstGroup thought these companies would make a lot of money. They thought they would grow.

Now, FirstGroup might sell both of these companies. Why did they change their minds?

David Martin became the chairman in August. Maybe this is why. But he seemed to agree with the old plan last month. So, something else might be happening.

An investor named Coast Capital wanted FirstGroup to sell its US companies. Another investor, Robert Tchenguiz, helped them. Now, it looks like they will get what they want.

If FirstGroup only has UK businesses, it will be much smaller. Now, it is one of the biggest transport companies in the world. It has 100,000 workers.

Even the UK bus business is not safe. FirstGroup is thinking about what to do with it. They need to pay their workers' pensions. It is not clear what will happen.

If the buses are sold too, FirstGroup will only have the UK train business. A year ago, FirstGroup wanted to leave the train business. Then, they won a contract for the West Coast Partnership. Now, the train business seems okay.

You could say FirstGroup is ""rationalizing."" This is a nice way of saying they are breaking up the company. But maybe there is an easier way. Maybe they should just run the businesses better. It is better than selling things.

**Mike Ashley's Strategy is Working**

Mike Ashley has talked about his ""elevation"" strategy for years. Now, it seems to be working. His company's share price went up a lot in one day. It went up 31%. But you need to understand why this happened."
69,69_2,2,"The improvement to 472p merely took the shares back to where they stood at the start of 2016, which is roughly when Ashley adopted his other obsession – diversification. House of Fraser, the main product of that ambition, clearly isn’t getting worse, which was why the shares jumped on Monday. But the eventual returns from the HoF deal remain a mystery. Ashley runs a tighter ship than the old management (no surprise there) but the long-term investment demands in the department store business are anyone’s guess.","Here's the rewritten text, simplified to approximately CEFR B2 level:

The price of the shares went up to 472p. This just brought them back to the price they were at in 2016. At that time, Ashley started trying new things for the company. He wanted to try diversification.

House of Fraser was the main result of this plan. It looks like House of Fraser is not getting worse. This is why the shares increased on Monday.

But we don't know what will happen with the House of Fraser deal in the future. It is still a mystery. Ashley manages the company better than the old managers. That is not surprising. But it's hard to know how much money will be needed to invest in department stores in the long term. Nobody knows for sure."
70,70_0,0,"With its army of perfectly groomed and manicured shop assistants, the department store beauty hall has traditionally been the backbone of a £2.5bn trade in expensive lipsticks, face creams or perfumes. But cosmetics sales have plummeted this year as high street shutdowns, coupled with the shift to home-working, has prompted many people to ditch their makeup bags. Sales of the designer brands sold via glossy counters in department stores are down by more than 40% this year, a decrease worth almost £500m, according to the market researcher NPD. The decline is even bigger if you throw in the £180m hit to sales of cheaper lipsticks and eyeshadows bought alongside groceries in supermarkets. Women are simply wearing less makeup, said Alexia Inge, the co-founder of the Cult Beauty website. “The lockdown expedited trends that were already happening. People were already starting to take a different approach to makeup from the Insta-glam layer-upon-layer [look].” The so-called “lipstick index” is often used as a barometer of consumer confidence during periods of economic turmoil. The term, which was coined by the former Estée Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder in the early 2000s, refers to the usual resiliency of cosmetics with makeup seen as an affordable indulgence when bigger purchases are out of reach. But the index never saw Covid-19 coming, with its mandatory face-coverings that mean no one can even see your lips, let alone what colour they are. During the lockdown, demand for products many would once have considered an essential part of their daily beauty routine – such as foundation and lipstick – was down by more than 70%. “Everyone likes to roll out Lauder’s lipstick effect … but lipstick sales are probably the worst of any category right now,” said Inge. Instead, she added, we should look at skincare, which is the “makeup equivalent” of the leisurewear people have been wearing at home during the pandemic. While Cult Beauty’s lipstick sales were down 8%, its skincare sales have more than doubled. This dramatic shift in spending priorities is borne out in figures from the department store chain John Lewis.","The beauty section in big stores used to be very important. They sold expensive makeup, like lipstick and creams. This business was worth a lot of money.

But now, things have changed. Many stores had to close. People started working from home. Because of this, many people stopped using makeup.

The sales of expensive makeup in big stores are much lower. They are down by more than 40%. This means they lost almost £500 million. A company called NPD found this out.

Even cheaper makeup is not selling well. The sales of cheap lipsticks and eyeshadows are down by £180 million. These are the ones people buy in supermarkets.

Alexia Inge is the boss of a website called Cult Beauty. She said that women are wearing less makeup. The lockdown made this happen faster. People were already changing how they used makeup. They were using less than before.

There is something called the ""lipstick index."" It shows how confident people are during bad economic times. If people buy lipstick, it means they are still spending money. It is like a small treat when they cannot buy big things.

But the ""lipstick index"" did not predict Covid-19. Now, people have to wear masks. You cannot see their lips, or the color of their lipstick.

During the lockdown, people bought much less makeup. They did not buy things like foundation and lipstick as much. The sales were down by more than 70%.

Alexia Inge said that lipstick sales are the worst right now.

Instead, people are buying skincare products. Skincare is like comfortable clothes for your face. People wear comfortable clothes when they stay home.

Cult Beauty sold less lipstick, but they sold much more skincare. Their lipstick sales went down by 8%. But their skincare sales more than doubled.

The store John Lewis also saw this change in what people are buying."
70,70_1,1,"Its sales of skincare, body and hair products are up 234% this year, as people opt to spend time caring for their skin rather than applying makeup. John Lewis predicts some of the changes seen this year will stay around and that cosmetics bags will get smaller as women abandon lip pencils and contouring sticks – a hard-to-do blending technique popularised by Kim Kardashian – and switch to easy to use multipurpose products, such as tinted moisturiser and lip balm. Long periods at home have driven shoppers into the arms of Cult Beauty and its discount-driven Lookfantastic, which is part of The Hut Group founded by the billionaire Matthew Moulding. In common with other retail markets such as furniture, more than 40% of beauty sales will be online this year – almost double 2019’s level. The failure of a major player like Debenhams, with its 124 stores and 12,000 staff, is a fresh blow for the beauty industry left reeling by this year’s lengthy salon closures. Yes, times are tough for the high street, said June Jensen-Mills, the head of UK beauty at market researchers NPD, but store sales are likely to bounce back in 2021. “I believe that bricks and mortar will go back to being important,” she said. “People will want to meet up with friends, try things, have a coffee. Debenhams is an important player in the world of beauty but when a retailer closes customers shift to similar retailers where they feel at home.” There are also new powerful forces at work in the industry as the glitzy websites of blockbuster brands such as Charlotte Tilbury compete with the department stores that are also their business partners. For shoppers the joy of the beauty hall lies in the ability to discover new brands, trial out textures, test colours and sample scents, but coronavirus restrictions mean that is, in many cases, no longer possible. But department stores brands are fighting back with innovative new ways of selling, such as virtual masterclasses and compiling “discovery boxes” of sample-sized products. People seem to like it.","This year, the company's sales of skincare products are much higher. The sales are up 234%. People want to take care of their skin. They do not want to use makeup as much.

John Lewis thinks some changes will stay. Makeup bags may become smaller. Women may stop using some makeup, like lip pencils. They may not use contouring sticks. Contouring is a hard makeup method that Kim Kardashian made popular. Women may use easier products. For example, they may use tinted moisturizer and lip balm.

People have stayed home for a long time. Because of this, they shop at Cult Beauty and Lookfantastic. Lookfantastic sells products at low prices. It is part of The Hut Group. Matthew Moulding started this group.

Beauty sales are now mostly online. More than 40% of beauty products will be sold online this year. This is almost double the amount in 2019. Furniture sales are also mostly online.

Debenhams was a big store. It had 124 stores and 12,000 workers. It closed down. This is bad news for the beauty industry. Many beauty salons also closed this year.

June Jensen-Mills works for NPD. NPD studies the market. She said times are hard for stores. But she thinks store sales will get better in 2021.

She thinks stores will be important again. People will want to meet friends. They will want to try products and have coffee. Debenhams was important for beauty. Now that it is closed, customers will go to other stores that are similar.

Big beauty brands have websites. For example, Charlotte Tilbury has a website. These websites compete with department stores. But the brands also sell their products in department stores. So they are business partners with the department stores.

People like to find new brands in beauty halls. They like to try textures and colors. They also like to smell perfumes. But because of the coronavirus, people cannot do these things.

Consumers may be looking for “simplicity” now but their feelings may change in 2021. “I have a strong feeling that once we come out of lockdown, and the bars and discos are open again, things will pick up,” said Jensen-Mills. “People will think ‘I’ve had an awful year and I want to make myself feel and look great’. Let’s just slap on loads of foundation and lipstick.”","Okay, here's the rewritten text, simplified to around CEFR B2 level, based on your instructions:

Last week, something amazing happened with makeup. Two big companies, John Lewis and Charlotte Tilbury, did something special. They had a very big online makeup class.

A lot of people joined the class. Ten thousand people signed up! This was a new record for the UK. It was the biggest makeup class ever in the UK. This is according to Guinness World Records.

People learned how to do makeup at home. They followed along with the class. The makeup look was inspired by supermodels from the 1990s. It was a ""timeless"" look, meaning it will always be stylish.

Right now, some people want simple makeup. But this might change next year, in 2021. Someone named Jensen-Mills thinks so.

Jensen-Mills said something about the future. She thinks things will get better after the lockdown. She thinks bars and clubs will open again.

She believes people will want to look good after a bad year. They will want to feel good too. She thinks they will use a lot of makeup. For example, foundation and lipstick!"
71,71_0,0,"Toyota will stop production at its British and French plants earlier than scheduled before Christmas because of the chaos caused by Covid-19 border closures. The Japanese carmaker said it was expecting shortages of parts as a result of transport delays, after France’s 48-hour ban on accompanied freight or cargo from Britain led to queues of lorries miles long stuck near Dover. Toyota said it had decided to bring forward the “planned seasonal stop” at its engine plant in Deeside in north Wales and its factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire, where it makes the Corolla. About 3,000 people are employed at the two plants. The Deeside site will close for Christmas on Tuesday and the Burnaston plant on Wednesday. Its French site will also stop production two days earlier than planned. The European factories would ordinarily have closed for an annual shutdown on Christmas Eve and remained shut until 4 January. Toyota said it wanted to “help ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”. The car manufacturer said it had taken the decision “in light of the traffic bans that a growing number of countries have issued for travel from the UK and due to the uncertain nature of how long the borders will be closed for logistics activities”. The extended shutdown caps a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, which halted production in the spring as the first wave of the pandemic took hold. The French government is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday about reopening transport links with the UK. Paris failed to lift its 48-hour ban on freight and passengers from Britain over fears about the new coronavirus strain, despite a phone call on Monday evening between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. France is one of more than 40 countries that have suspended flights and trains from the UK, including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey and Canada. However, the suspension of cross-Channel transport has caused the most disruption in and around British ports, which were already struggling with increased workloads because of the arrival of Christmas goods, companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit and coronavirus restrictions.","Toyota will stop making cars in Britain and France. This will happen before Christmas. The reason is problems caused by Covid-19 and closed borders.

The car company thinks they will not have enough parts. This is because transport is slow. France stopped trucks from Britain for two days. This made long lines of trucks near Dover.

Toyota will stop work earlier at two factories. One is in Deeside in Wales. It makes engines. The other is in Burnaston in England. It makes Corolla cars. About 3,000 people work at these factories.

The factory in Deeside will close on Tuesday for Christmas. The factory in Burnaston will close on Wednesday. The factory in France will also stop working two days early.

Usually, the factories close for Christmas on December 24. They open again on January 4.

Toyota wants to keep its workers safe. They also want to help the companies that bring them parts. They are also thinking about what is best for everyone.

Toyota made this decision because many countries have stopped travel from the UK. They also do not know how long the borders will be closed for trucks.

This year has been hard for car companies. They stopped making cars in the spring because of the virus.

The French government may say something on Tuesday about opening the borders with the UK again.

France did not open the borders. They are worried about a new type of virus. The leaders of Britain and France talked on the phone on Monday, but the borders are still closed.

Many countries have stopped flights and trains from the UK. These countries include Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey, and Canada.

Stopping transport across the English Channel has caused big problems. The ports in Britain were already busy. They had more work because of Christmas, Brexit, and the virus."
72,72_0,0,"Shaftesbury, one of the biggest landlords in central London, has slumped to a £700m loss after slashing the value of its portfolio, as the West End braces for tougher Covid-19 restrictions. The company, which owns parts of Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden, has been hit by the sharp fall in the number of tourists and office workers coming into the capital. It said vacancies at its shops, restaurants and offices had nearly tripled to 10.2% in the year to 30 September. As tenants struggled to pay their rent, Shaftesbury’s net income fell by 24% to £74.3 . It collected only 53% of the rent due in the second half of the year. This resulted in an annual loss after tax of £699.5m, compared with a profit of £26m the previous year. Shaftesbury wrote down the value of its portfolio by 18.3% to £3.1bn, as the amount of empty space in the West End increased, rental income fell and physical distancing measures reduced demand from retail and office tenants for more space. Brian Bickell, the Shaftesbury chief executive, said: “Rarely in history has the world seen such widespread disruption to normal patterns of life. Only now are we seeing the first positive signs that conditions will begin to improve in the year ahead.” Shaftesbury said its leasing activity had declined sharply since February due to the pandemic and was below normal levels, although there had been a pickup in inquiries in recent weeks. The pandemic has also forced landlords to rewrite lease agreements to help tenants get through the crisis, and Shaftesbury moved permanently to monthly rents for most commercial tenants from October. The company said its rental and service charge support for tenants was likely to continue through 2021, “with our occupiers having reduced income in the important period leading up to Christmas and into the new year, which traditionally has provided them with liquidity buffers to withstand the normally slower quarter to March”. London is among the areas that enter tier 3 restrictions on Wednesday, which means hotels, pubs, bars and restaurants have to close again and can only do takeaways and deliver. Shaftesbury gave a gloomy outlook for next year, predicting that pandemic control measures were “likely for much of 2021”.","Here's a rewritten version of the text, simplified for CEFR B2 level:

Shaftesbury is a very big owner of buildings in London. They own buildings in the center of London. Recently, they lost a lot of money. They lost £700 million. This happened because their buildings are now worth less. The West End area of London is getting ready for tougher rules because of Covid-19.

Shaftesbury owns parts of Chinatown, Soho, and Covent Garden. Not many tourists or office workers are coming to London. This has hurt Shaftesbury. Many of their shops, restaurants, and offices are empty. The number of empty places has almost tripled. Now, 10.2% of their properties are empty. This was measured in the year ending September 30th.

The people who rent their buildings are having trouble paying. Because of this, Shaftesbury made less money. Their income fell by 24% to £74.3 million. They only received 53% of the rent they were owed in the last six months of the year.

Because of all this, they lost £699.5 million after tax. Last year, they made a profit of £26 million. The value of their buildings went down by 18.3%. Now, their buildings are worth £3.1 billion. There is more empty space in the West End. They also get less money from rent. Social distancing rules mean shops and offices don't need as much space.

Brian Bickell is the boss of Shaftesbury. He said the world has seen big problems that changed how people live. He said that things may start to get better soon.

Shaftesbury said they have been renting out fewer spaces since February. This is because of the pandemic. They are not renting as many places as usual. But more people have been asking about renting in recent weeks.

The pandemic has also made landlords change the rental agreements. This helps the people renting to get through the difficult time. Shaftesbury now lets most shops and offices pay rent every month, starting in October.

Shaftesbury will probably keep helping renters with rent and service charges in 2021. This is because businesses will make less money before Christmas and in the new year. Normally, they earn more money at that time, which helps them pay bills later.

London is going into Tier 3 restrictions soon. This means hotels, pubs, bars, and restaurants have to close again. They can only offer takeaway food and delivery.

Shaftesbury thinks next year will be difficult. They think rules to control the pandemic will continue for much of 2021."
72,72_1,1,"Even so, the firm was confident in the West End’s long-term ability to attract visitors. Bickell said: “In the year ahead, the widespread distribution of effective vaccines will bring a gradual return of confidence and activity across the West End and, a recovery in domestic footfall and spending to our villages. “At the present time, it is not possible to predict at what point conditions will improve but it is likely social distancing and other restrictions, with the risk of further lockdowns, will continue into the spring and possibly early summer, putting further financial strain on many of our occupiers.”","The company still believed in the West End. They thought it would bring people in the future.

Bickell said that vaccines would help. He said that when many people get vaccines, things will get better. People will feel safe and go to the West End again. People from the UK will visit and spend money in the small towns there.

We do not know when things will improve. But we think rules like social distancing will stay. There might be more lockdowns. This could last until spring, or maybe early summer. This will make it hard for businesses to make money."
73,73_0,0,"Britain’s economy is suffering increasing damage from the rapid growth in Covid infections, renewed lockdown measures, and turmoil over Brexit at the end of the worst year for growth in three centuries, according to a Guardian analysis. With negotiations going down to the wire amid vast tailbacks at Dover before the Brexit transition expires on New Year’s Eve, the latest figures from the UK economy show stalling growth, falling retail sales, and redundancies rising at the fastest rate since records began. In a month that started with a burst of optimism as a British woman became the first patient in the world to receive the coronavirus vaccine, December is ending with the pandemic surging to a fresh peak and Boris Johnson’s government imposing tougher lockdown measures before Christmas. To counter the emergence of a faster-spreading Covid variant in the UK, and as Brexit talks intensify, the French ban on freight movements has led to chaos in Kent days before a no-deal Brexit could trigger renewed turmoil. Official figures had shown the British economy recovered from lockdown this spring at a faster rate than first anticipated, amid hopes that a vaccine could bring an early end to the crisis. However, economists now forecast a double-dip recession and tougher lockdowns lasting into 2021 before the vaccine can be rolled out widely enough. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Brexit – with or without a trade deal with Brussels – would hit an already weak UK economy at the start of next year. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “It does seem to me to be the worst decision in peacetime any country in the world has made in a thousand years. Lines of lorries at Dover and Folkestone do not augur well for what is to come, even before Boris Johnson cancelled Christmas.” Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries.","The UK economy is having problems. This is because of more Covid infections and new lockdown rules. Brexit is also causing trouble. This year has been the worst for the economy in 300 years, said the Guardian newspaper.

Brexit talks are still happening. There are long lines of trucks in Dover because of Brexit. New data shows the UK economy is not growing very much. Shops are selling less, and many people are losing their jobs. This is the worst job loss rate ever recorded.

December started well. A British woman was the first person to get the Covid vaccine. But now, Covid cases are very high. The government has made lockdown rules stricter before Christmas.

A new, faster Covid virus is spreading in the UK. Brexit talks are also getting more intense. France stopped trucks from entering, which caused problems in Kent. This happened because a no-deal Brexit could cause even more trouble.

The UK economy grew quickly after the first lockdown in spring. People hoped a vaccine would end the crisis soon. But now, experts think there will be another recession. They think lockdowns will last into 2021 until enough people get the vaccine.

David Blanchflower used to work for the Bank of England. He said Brexit will hurt the UK economy, even with a trade deal with Brussels. He wrote in the Guardian that Brexit is a very bad decision. He said the truck lines in Dover are a bad sign for the future. Boris Johnson even canceled Christmas celebrations.

The Guardian newspaper is watching the economy. They are looking at eight things, like jobs and the FTSE 100 stock market. This helps them see how Covid-19 and the lockdown rules are affecting the economy.

The world is having a big recession because of Covid-19. The Guardian is also comparing the UK economy to other countries. They want to see how the UK is doing during this crisis."
73,73_1,1,"In the past month, there have been some bright spots for the economy, including a recovery in business activity in early December after the second national lockdown in England. Tougher restrictions in the autumn appear to have had less of an impact on growth and jobs than during the first wave of the pandemic. Official figures show Britain’s economy staged a faster recovery in the third quarter of the year than was first estimated, after a rapid return to work after the first lockdown. However, official growth figures also show the economy started sinking towards a double-dip recession even before Covid restrictions were reimposed in November. The Bank of England has warned the economy will shrink in the final months of 2020 and could remain weaker than expected at the start of 2021, as controls are kept in place to handle rising infections before the Covid vaccine can be rolled out widely. In response to the renewed period of economic pain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unexpectedly extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, a month longer than planned. Use of the flagship wage subsidy programme, which has cost the government almost £50bn so far, doubled in November to about 5 million workers, reflects the intense pressure facing companies. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of people being made redundant reached a record high in October, at a time when the government was winding down furlough before a last-minute U-turn to extend the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends. Blanchflower said: “The issue is whether these jobs – many in pubs, clubs and restaurants – return after the furlough payments stop. But many jobs won’t return, if there are long-run changes in behaviour after the pandemic as expected.”","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR B2 level English:

The economy had some good news in the last month. Businesses started to do better in early December. This was after England's second lockdown. The rules in autumn did not hurt the economy as much as the first lockdown.

The UK economy grew faster in the third part of the year than first thought. This happened after people went back to work quickly after the first lockdown. However, the economy started to get worse again before November. This was before the new rules for Covid. It looked like the economy might shrink again.

The Bank of England said the economy will get smaller at the end of 2020. It might stay weak at the start of 2021. This is because the rules will stay to stop the virus from spreading. The vaccine will need time to reach many people.

Because of this, the government is helping people more. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the furlough scheme will continue until the end of April. This is one month longer than planned. The furlough scheme helps people get paid even if they cannot work. It has cost the government almost £50 billion. In November, twice as many people used the scheme. About 5 million workers used it. This shows that companies are having a hard time.

Sunak said there will be a budget on March 3rd. This will show the government's next plan to help the economy. Business groups and the Labour party said more help is needed. They want to support companies and workers during the lockdown.

Many people lost their jobs in October. This was when the government was planning to stop the furlough scheme. But then, they changed their mind and continued the scheme. Unemployment might reach 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends.

Blanchflower said some jobs might not come back after the furlough ends. These are jobs in pubs, clubs, and restaurants. He thinks people might change how they live after the pandemic. This means some jobs will disappear forever."
74,74_0,0,"The former owner of Norton Motorcycles will be forced to pay back about £14m missing from the company’s employee retirement fund, after being refused permission to appeal against a pensions ombudsman’s ruling. Stuart Garner, who acquired the classic marque in 2008 and was feted for years by a series of UK government ministers, was told by the regulator in June to refund three retirement funds he controlled as trustee, following an ombudsman ruling that he had acted dishonestly. The ombudsman’s decision followed an investigation triggered by claims brought by 30 members that Garner had repeatedly failed to return their funds when they were due. The Pension Schemes Act requires trustees to transfer pensions within six months of an application. The court’s refusal to entertain Garner’s request to appeal is another blow for the businessman, who appears to have been pushed a step closer to personal bankruptcy. He is already the subject of a personal bankruptcy petition filed by Leicester city council. The repayment of the £14m to the pension holders, the vast majority of whom were never Norton employees, had been on hold while the court considered Garner’s request for permission to appeal. In an August order delaying the payment, Mr Justice Fancourt said: “The sum likely to be payable … is extremely large and it is readily understandable that [Garner] will not be able to pay it and that, as a result, he is liable to be made bankrupt.” In his latest judgment refusing an appeal, however, Fancourt stated: “There could have been no good reason to delay the payment of compensation unless there was compelling evidence that it would be provided by other means within the timescale specified by the ombudsman.” Garner has been granted permission to appeal against a further £180,000 in distress payments to 30 of the scheme’s 228 members, to whom he had repeatedly failed to return funds when they were due. The businessman’s law firm said: “Mr Garner has been granted permission to appeal the inconvenience award, and has renewed his application for permission to appeal in respect of the refusal.” Garner, who was the trustee of three Norton pension funds, invested all of the members’ savings into his own company, but Norton slumped into administration on 29 January.","The old owner of Norton Motorcycles must pay back money. He owes about £14 million. This money is missing from the company's retirement fund for workers.

The owner, Stuart Garner, asked if he could appeal the decision. But the court said no. He must pay the money back.

Stuart Garner bought Norton Motorcycles in 2008. He was praised by government leaders for many years.

In June, the group that watches over pensions told him to pay back the money. He controlled three retirement funds as a trustee. The group said he was not honest.

This decision came after an investigation. Thirty people said Garner did not return their money when he should have.

The law says that pension trustees must move pensions within six months of someone asking.

The court said no to Garner's appeal. This is bad news for him. He may now become bankrupt. This means he may not have enough money to pay his debts.

Leicester city council already asked the court to make him bankrupt.

Garner had to pay £14 million to the people who had pensions. Most of these people did not work for Norton. He did not have to pay while the court thought about his appeal.

In August, a judge said that Garner probably could not pay the money. The judge said this could lead to him becoming bankrupt.

But now the judge has refused the appeal. The judge said there was no good reason to wait to pay the money. He said Garner did not show that he could pay the money in another way.

Garner can still appeal another decision. He must pay £180,000 to 30 people. These people are part of the pension plan. He did not return their money when he should have.

Garner's lawyers said he can appeal the payment for the trouble he caused. He also wants to appeal the court's decision to refuse his first appeal.

Garner was in charge of three Norton pension funds. He put all the members' savings into his own company. But Norton had problems and went out of business on January 29."
74,74_1,1,"The ombudsman’s determination in the summer stated: “The trustee has acted dishonestly and in breach of his duty of no conflict, his duty not to profit and his duty to act with prudence.” The decision followed a Guardian and ITV News investigation in January that showed how 228 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares after they had been duped by a fraudster. Garner received the retirement savings during 2012 and 2013, after a scam that resulted in a promoter, Simon Colfer, being convicted of fraud in 2018 for the way he had sold the scheme. Two further Garner associates involved in setting up the Norton pensions schemes, Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley, were convicted of a separate tax fraud in 2013, when they reclaimed £5m of tax rebates from fictitious pension contributions. Court documents from that trial show that £990,000 of the fraud proceeds were loaned to Garner to acquire Norton in 2008. Garner denies wrongdoing and has said he considers himself a victim because he did not know he was dealing with fraudsters.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR B2 level English:

The ombudsman made a decision in the summer. He said the trustee did something wrong. The trustee was not honest. He did not do his job well. He did not avoid conflicts of interest. He made money when he should not have. He did not act carefully.

This decision came after an investigation. The Guardian and ITV News looked into the situation in January. They found that 228 people lost their pensions. These people were regular workers. Their pension money was used to buy shares in Norton. A dishonest person tricked them.

Someone named Garner received the pension money. This happened in 2012 and 2013. Before this, someone called Simon Colfer cheated people. He sold the pension plan in a bad way. He was found guilty of fraud in 2018.

Two other people were also involved. Their names are Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley. They helped set up the Norton pension plans. They did something illegal with taxes in 2013. They took back £5 million in tax money. This money was supposed to be for fake pension payments.

Documents from the court case showed something. £990,000 from the fraud was given to Garner. He used it to buy Norton in 2008.

Garner says he did nothing wrong. He says he is also a victim. He says he did not know he was working with dishonest people."
75,75_0,0,"Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are much more likely than white people to work in hospitality, one of the sectors hardest hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic as restaurants, bars and other venues have been shut for months during the lockdowns. About one in 12 (8%) workers from BAME backgrounds are employed in hospitality roles. That compares with about one in 20 (5%) white British workers, research from the Resolution Foundation shows. Overall, 300,000 people from BAME backgrounds work in hospitality. The thinktank’s report found that even before the pandemic hit, hospitality was one of the lowest paying sectors in the economy, with a typical hourly pay of £8.72. It said that 23% of hospitality workers were paid at or below the national living wage. The research found that BAME workers in the sector also faced “pay penalties” – pay gaps that account for workers’ age, qualifications, experience, and the kinds of jobs they do – relative to white British workers. “Crucially, these pay penalties are bigger than the raw pay gaps found in official earnings data – suggesting that the extent of disadvantage is bigger than previously thought,” the report said. BAME men were paid 65p an hour less than white British men on average, the report found. BAME women were also underpaid compared with white British women but the gap was less severe. The report found that while hospitality as a whole disproportionately employed young people – over a third of its workforce were aged 16-24 – this was not always the case for BAME workers. For example, the typical age of a Bangladeshi worker in hospitality was 42 – higher than the typical age for Bangladeshi workers across the whole economy (35), and higher than white British workers in hospitality (28). Indian workers in hospitality were among the highest paid ethnic group per hour (£8.96) and among the most likely to be in high-paying occupations (28%) such as hotel and restaurant managers. This corresponds with 41% of Indian hospitality workers holding a degree. In comparison, one in four Bangladeshi hospitality workers had no qualifications and typically earned 12% less than Indian hospitality workers, at £7.85 an hour.","People from Black, Asian, and other ethnic groups (BAME) often work in hospitality. Hospitality includes jobs in restaurants and hotels.

This industry has been hurt by the pandemic. Restaurants and bars had to close for a long time.

Many BAME people work in hospitality. About 8% of BAME workers have these jobs. Only 5% of white British workers work in hospitality.

About 300,000 BAME people work in hospitality.

A study shows that hospitality jobs did not pay much even before the pandemic. The average pay was about £8.72 per hour.

About 23% of hospitality workers were paid the lowest legal wage or less.

The study also found that BAME workers are paid less than white British workers. This is even when they have the same age, skills, and experience.

This means that BAME people are more disadvantaged than we thought.

BAME men earn 65p less per hour than white British men on average. BAME women also earn less than white British women, but the difference is smaller.

Many young people work in hospitality. More than one-third of workers are between 16 and 24 years old. But this is not always true for BAME workers.

For example, many Bangladeshi hospitality workers are older. The average age is 42. This is older than other Bangladeshi workers and white British workers in hospitality.

Indian hospitality workers earn more than other ethnic groups. They earn about £8.96 per hour. They are also more likely to have high-paying jobs like managers.

Many Indian workers in hospitality have a university degree (41%).

Bangladeshi workers often have less education. One in four have no qualifications. They earn about £7.85 per hour, which is 12% less than Indian workers."
75,75_1,1,"Nye Cominetti, the senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “As workers from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately likely to work in hospitality, a significant number of workers risk moving into unemployment when the furlough scheme ends in the spring. “The government should bear that in mind for the jobs support programmes it is providing.” A report by the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association and the consultancy Oxford Economics has previously warned that 291,000 jobs in the hospitality trade could be lost as a result of coronavirus restrictions. The forecast was based on industry data suggesting that 25% of pubs could close, with the remainder barely breaking even as they struggle to cope with reduced custom and limited opening hours. Oxford Economics said the worst-case scenario would reduce the sector’s economic output by £7.4bn and cut wages by £3.9bn.","Here is the rewritten text in B2 level English:

Nye Cominetti is an economist. He works for the Resolution Foundation. He said something important. Many workers from BAME groups work in hospitality. BAME means Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic. These workers might lose their jobs. This could happen when the furlough scheme ends. The furlough scheme is help from the government. It pays workers who cannot work. The scheme will end in the spring.

Mr. Cominetti thinks the government should remember this. They should help these workers. The government has job support programs. These programs should help people in hospitality.

A report said many jobs could be lost. The British Beer & Pubs Association made the report. Oxford Economics helped them. They said 291,000 jobs could be lost. This is because of the coronavirus rules.

The report thinks many pubs might close. About 25% of pubs could close. The other pubs might not make much money. They have fewer customers. They can only open for a short time.

Oxford Economics said things could be very bad. The economy could lose a lot of money. The hospitality sector could lose £7.4 billion. Workers could lose £3.9 billion in wages."
76,76_0,0,"Family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain &amp; Co has handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened their closure. Brains, whose pubs are mainly based in south and west Wales, said it had come “under significant financial pressure” during the pandemic, as restrictions mean pubs must remain closed except for takeaway and delivery. The company closed its entire pub estate on 4 December after the announcement of a ban on alcohol sales and enforced 6pm closing across Wales to try to contain a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Remaining open under those restrictions was “not a viable option”, Brains said. SA Brain &amp; Co was established in 1882 in Cardiff, and became Wales’s biggest brewer and pubs company while remaining under family ownership. John Rhys, the company chairman who oversaw the deal, is the great-grandson of founder Samuel Arthur Brain. Before the pandemic, the pubs included in the deal made £14m a year in core earnings. Marston’s will take over the pubs in February, mostly under 25-year leases from Brains. The annual rent on the pubs was £5.5m. The pubs will be run under the Brains brand, and will continue to sell its beer, which is brewed at a facility in Cardiff Bay that was opened in March 2019. Before that Brains was made in breweries in Cardiff’s city centre. Rhys said: “We know and trust Marston’s to be excellent custodians of our pubs and, while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we are confident that our pubs and our pubs teams will thrive under their stewardship. “Furthermore, this transaction enables Brains to recapitalise its balance sheet and continue its long heritage as an independent entity, preserving this great Welsh business for generations to come.” Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, runs about 1,400 pubs across the UK, including 106 in Wales. The 1,300 employees in Brains pubs will transfer to Marston’s, which employs a further 14,000 people across the UK.","A Welsh company called SA Brain & Co owns many pubs. They have had problems because of the coronavirus.

The coronavirus made it hard for pubs to stay open. Pubs could only sell takeaway food and drinks.

Brains had to close all their pubs in December. This was because Wales said pubs could not sell alcohol after 6 pm. It was too hard for Brains to stay open with these rules.

Brains decided to let another company run their pubs. This company is called Marston’s. This will save 1,300 jobs.

Brains is a family company. It started in 1882. It is the biggest beer and pub company in Wales.

John Rhys is the boss of Brains. He is the great-grandson of the person who started the company.

The pubs made a lot of money before the coronavirus. They made £14 million each year.

Marston’s will start running the pubs in February. They will rent the pubs from Brains for 25 years. They will pay £5.5 million each year to rent them.

The pubs will still be called Brains pubs. They will still sell Brains beer. Brains beer is made in Cardiff Bay. The beer factory opened in 2019. Before that, Brains beer was made in the city center of Cardiff.

He also said this deal will help Brains. It will help them to have more money. Brains can stay an independent company. This will keep the Welsh business going for a long time.

Marston’s used to be called Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries. They changed their name in 2007. Marston’s runs about 1,400 pubs in the UK. They have 106 pubs in Wales.

77,77_0,0,"Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite an overall drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home prompted consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres. Data from Barclaycard shows spending at independent food and drink shops, including off-licences, butchers and bakeries, jumped 28.6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, total consumer spending fell 7.1%, as social distancing rules left shoppers with fewer opportunities to spend on overseas holidays, hospitality and in city centres. Barclaycard, which covers nearly half of the UK’s credit and debit card transactions, found that while spending on essential goods such as groceries rose by 4.1% compared with 2019, non-essential spending fell 11.3%. Department stores were particularly hard hit, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. However, bricks and mortar discounters had a 25.4% increase, as Britons facing furlough and job cuts sought value for money deals. Consumers forced to spend more time at home turned to DIY projects to spruce up their living space. Pent-up demand after the reopening of non-essential shops in June pushed overall spending at DIY and home goods stores up 9.8% for the year. Furniture retailers reported a 5.3% rise, as consumers invested in big ticket items. Britons treated themselves – as well as friends and family they could not see – to flowers throughout the year, with spending at florists rising 22.7%. Crafts and hobby spending increased 9.8%, and pets were given extra attention with vet and pet retail increasing 10.7%. But the report also shows how much restaurants suffered despite Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” initiative over the summer. Restrictions throughout the rest of the year contributed to a 47% drop in restaurant spending, while bars and pubs took a 36.7% hit. However, Covid restrictions contributed to a 49.1% rise in spending on online takeaway orders, while meal subscription services jumped 62.4%. Demand for at-home entertainment pushed spending on digital subscriptions up 31.5%, while money spent on electronics including game consoles rose 10.8%.","In 2020, shops in Britain had a difficult time because of Covid. But some small, local shops did better than expected.

People could not travel easily. Many people worked from home. So, they shopped in their local areas instead of going to big cities.

Barclaycard has information about how people spent their money. They found that spending at small food shops increased a lot. These shops include butchers, bakers, and places that sell alcohol. Spending at these shops went up by about 29% compared to the year before.

But overall, people spent less money. Total spending went down by about 7%. This is because people could not go on holiday or spend money in restaurants and city centers.

Barclaycard also found that people spent more on important things like food. This spending went up by about 4%. But they spent less on things that were not important. This spending went down by about 11%.

Big department stores had a very hard time. Spending in these stores went down by about 17%. Shops that sold clothes also did badly. Their sales went down by about 16%. This caused problems for some big companies.

But discount shops that have physical stores did well. Their sales went up by about 25%. This is because many people lost their jobs or earned less money. So, they wanted to find good deals.

People spent more time at home. So, they started doing projects to improve their homes. After the shops opened again in June, people bought a lot of things for their homes. This made spending at DIY and home goods stores go up by about 10% for the whole year.

Shops that sold furniture also did well. Their sales went up by about 5%. People bought new furniture for their homes.

People also bought flowers for themselves and for their friends and family. Spending on flowers went up by about 23%.

People spent more money on crafts and hobbies. Spending on these things went up by about 10%. They also took care of their pets. Spending on vets and pet shops went up by about 11%.

But restaurants had a very hard time. The government tried to help them with a plan called ""eat out to help out"". But it was not enough. Because of Covid rules, spending in restaurants went down by about 47%. Bars and pubs also suffered. Their sales went down by about 37%.

However, people ordered more takeaway food online. Spending on online takeaways went up by about 49%. People also used meal subscription services more. Spending on these services went up by about 62%.

People wanted to be entertained at home. So, they spent more money on things like Netflix. Spending on these services went up by about 32%. They also spent more money on electronics like game consoles. Spending on electronics went up by about 11%."

E-commerce has seen huge growth, working from home has meant many are shopping more locally, and experiences within the home, such as virtual workouts, have become the norm.” Travel spending, including on airlines and travel agents, tumbled 61.1% in August and 63.1% in September, as coronavirus restrictions and quarantine rules took their toll. “Hopefully with a vaccine being rolled out in 2021 we will see green shoots for the most severely impacted sectors,” Ahmed said. “Having said that, some of the trends and changes we have seen in customer habits may be here to stay.”","Online shops that sell many different things did very well. People spent much more money there. The amount spent went up by 52.5%.

Raheel Ahmed works for Barclaycard. He said that 2020 changed many things very quickly.

Shopping online grew a lot. Many people worked from home. Because of this, they shopped more in their local areas. They also did things like exercise online at home. This became normal.

People did not spend as much money on travel. This includes flights and travel companies. Spending went down a lot in August (61.1%) and September (63.1%). This was because of the virus rules. People had to stay home or quarantine. This hurt the travel business.

Ahmed hopes things will get better in 2021. He said a vaccine might help. The businesses that were hurt the most could start to recover.

However, Ahmed also said that some changes might stay. The way people shop may have changed for good."
78,78_0,0,"The plus-size clothing brand Evans has been bought out of administration in a £23m deal that will result in the closure of all its stores and concessions with the potential loss of hundreds of jobs . The chain is the first part of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group to be sold off, marking the beginning of the breakup of his fashion empire, which also includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, plans to operate Evans, which made sales of £26m online and via wholesale last year, as an online-only brand. That will mean the closure of more than 100 Evans concessions and outlets within other Arcadia stores. Five standalone stores will permanently close with the loss of 25 jobs. The concessions and other outlets will not close immediately but hundreds of jobs are at risk at those outlets. Arcadia, which employs 13,000 people at about 500 outlets, collapsed into administration last month as high street lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic piled on pressure after years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. Bids for all the brands are due to be filed on Monday, with Topshop expected to attract offers of up to £200m. Bidders are thought to include the online specialist Boohoo, the fashion and homewares group Next, and Authentic Brands, the owner of the US department store Barneys. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, is also thought to be interested in the smaller Arcadia brands. Administrators from Deloitte said on Monday there had been “significant expressions of interest for all brands”. They said they did not expect to provide a further update on the process until January. City Chic Collective said it had bought Evans as part of a plan to extend its portfolio of plus-size brands, which include City Chic and Hips &amp; Curves, into Europe. It operates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it bought the Avenue brand last year. The company already had a relationship with Evans, which has sold City Chic products via its website for the past five years. “Our vision has always been to lead a world of curves,” said Phil Ryan, the chief executive of City Chic Collective.","Evans is a shop that sells clothes for bigger people. It has been sold for 23 million pounds. This means all of the Evans shops will close. Many people may lose their jobs.

Evans was part of a bigger group of shops called Arcadia. The Arcadia group belongs to Sir Philip Green. Arcadia also owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, and other shops. Selling Evans is the first step in breaking up the Arcadia group.

A company from Australia called City Chic Collective is buying Evans. City Chic Collective will only sell Evans clothes online. Last year, Evans sold 26 million pounds worth of clothes online. Because Evans will only sell online, over 100 Evans shops inside other Arcadia stores will close. Five Evans shops that are separate will also close. 25 people will lose their jobs at these shops.

The other Evans shops inside Arcadia are not closing right away. But many people who work at these shops may lose their jobs soon.

Arcadia has 13,000 workers in about 500 shops. Arcadia had problems and could not pay its bills. This is because many shops had to close because of the coronavirus. Before the coronavirus, Arcadia was already selling less because other shops like Boohoo and Primark were selling better.

Other companies want to buy the other shops in the Arcadia group. Topshop could be sold for 200 million pounds. Some companies that want to buy Topshop are Boohoo, Next, and Authentic Brands. Mike Ashley's company, Frasers Group, may also want to buy some of the smaller shops.

Deloitte is helping to sell the Arcadia shops. They said that many companies want to buy them. They will give more news about the sales in January.

City Chic Collective wants to buy Evans to sell more clothes for bigger people in Europe. They already sell clothes in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. They bought a brand called Avenue last year. City Chic Collective already worked with Evans. Evans sold City Chic clothes on its website for five years.

79,79_0,0,"Retail sales fell by 3.8% in November on the previous month as the coronavirus lockdown in England and restrictions elsewhere in the UK shut much of the high street. Ending a six-month run of rising sales, the figures revealed the impact of the pandemic on the sector as the infection rate increased across the country. A 19% fall in clothing sales followed the closure of most department stores and non-essential shops. A government message that workers should stay at home if they could caused car journeys to slump and petrol sales to follow suit, with a 16.6% decline. The only bright spot for retailers was an increase in the sale of household goods of 1.6% as shoppers went online to stock up for Christmas. Supermarkets and food stores increased sales by 3.1%. Analysts said it was no surprise the lockdown bolstered online shopping to a record total of 31.4% of all spending, after an increase of almost 75% since November 2019. The Office for National Statistics said 90% of businesses continued to trade in some form through the month, mostly via a click-and-collect service. But only 68.8% of department stores continued trading. Meanwhile, many online retailers reported a boom in sales, as they did during the UK-wide lockdown in spring, though heavy discounting helped to keep the tills ringing. The ONS said this week price-cutting by clothing retailers last month pushed UK inflation down to 0.3%, from 0.7% a month earlier. The Bank of England’s inflation target is 2%. Aled Patchett, the head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: “November’s sales highlight once again the polarising effect of Covid-19 on retail. Sectors like grocery and homeware perform well – and should be expected to have a strong finish to the year – while others including big-name high street brands fall foul of significantly reduced footfall. “Despite most shoppers having wrapped up their Covid Christmas shopping online this year, shops – particularly in smaller towns – will be hoping that the vaccine rollout inspires greater consumer confidence in the new year as people return to city centres for both work and play.” In October, a 6.4% increase in online sales spurred a 1.2% rise in the total volume of retail spending, mainly driven by shoppers rushing to buy early Christmas presents before the second lockdown in England.","Shops sold less in November. Sales went down by 3.8% compared to the month before. This happened because of the coronavirus lockdown in England. There were also rules in other parts of the UK. These rules closed many shops.

Sales had been going up for six months. But now, the pandemic is affecting shops. More people were getting sick across the country.

Clothes shops sold 19% less than before. This is because most big shops and non-essential shops closed.

The government told people to work from home if they could. Because of this, fewer people used their cars. Petrol sales went down by 16.6%.

But some shops did well. Shops that sell things for the house sold 1.6% more. People were buying things online for Christmas. Supermarkets and food shops sold 3.1% more.

Experts said it was not surprising that online shopping increased. People shopped online a lot because of the lockdown. Online shopping was 31.4% of all spending. This is a record. It has gone up almost 75% since November 2019.

The Office for National Statistics said that most businesses were still open in some way. About 90% of businesses were open. They were mostly using a service where people could order online and pick up their items. But only 68.8% of big shops were still open.

Many online shops sold a lot. This also happened during the lockdown in spring. They had sales to get people to buy things.

The Office for National Statistics said that clothes shops had sales last month. This made prices go down. The UK inflation went down to 0.3%. It was 0.7% the month before. The Bank of England wants inflation to be 2%.

Aled Patchett works at Lloyds Bank. He said that the sales in November show how the coronavirus is affecting shops in different ways. Shops that sell food and things for the house are doing well. They should have a good end to the year. But other shops, like big name shops, are not doing well. This is because fewer people are going to the shops.

Most people bought their Christmas presents online this year because of the coronavirus. Shops hope that the vaccine will make people feel more confident. They hope that people will go back to city centers to work and have fun.

In October, online sales went up by 6.4%. This made total sales go up by 1.2%. This happened because people were buying Christmas presents early. They wanted to buy them before the second lockdown in England."
79,79_1,1,"Lee Lucas, the chief executive of the Fashion Retail Academy, which has partnerships with some of Britain’s biggest retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Next, said he was not surprised the November lockdown triggered a fall in clothing sales. “November is one the busiest months of the year for retailers, so this emergency measure by the government will have been directly responsible for the unusually high level of discounting currently in stores, with shops fighting for every consumer in the briefest of run-ups to Christmas.”","Lee Lucas is in charge of the Fashion Retail Academy. This school works with big shops like Marks & Spencer and Next. He said he knew that closing shops in November would make clothing sales go down.

November is usually a very busy month for shops. The government made a rule to close shops quickly. This made shops lower their prices a lot. They were trying hard to get people to buy things before Christmas. The time before Christmas was very short. So, shops had to compete for customers."
80,80_0,0,"The UK public’s appetite for eating out has plunged to its weakest since the spring amid growing evidence of the impact of the Omicron variant on the hospitality sector during its crucial pre-Christmas period. The number of seated diners fell by 14 percentage points in the week ending 20 December to 88% of the level in the same period of 2019, before the start of the pandemic, according to the weekly digest of flash economic indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Using data from the online restaurant booking site OpenTable and other sources, the ONS said Britons were eating out less and working from home more in response to rising infection rates and the government’s plan B measures. Amid widespread reports of bookings being cancelled, the drop in the number of diners in the latest week was the sharpest since early September and the lowest level since restaurants reopened indoors in England, Scotland and Wales in May after last winter’s lockdown. It was also the first time the weekly comparison with 2019 has dropped below 100% since May. Restaurants in London have been especially hard hit by Omicron, with the number of diners in the latest week falling 18 points to 57% of the level in the same period of 2019. In Manchester, despite an eight-point drop on the week, the number of diners stood at 104% of the level in the run-up to Christmas 2019. The ONS said the number of firms reporting staff working from home in the latest two weeks had risen by two points to 14%, with a marked impact on businesses reliant on consumers. Transactions at Pret a Manger sandwich outlets were lower in the week ending 16 December than in January 2020 in six of seven urban locations, with London again the most affected city. While trade in regional towns remained above pre-pandemic levels, sales in the capital dropped by 29 points to barely 50% of the January 2020 level. The ONS report showed retailers doing less badly than restaurants, with footfall in the latest week 81% of its 2019 level – a drop of only one percentage point. Credit and debt card payment purchases were up 4% on a year ago. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced an emergency £1bn package to help businesses struggling with the impact of Omicron.","People in the UK are not eating out as much. This is because of the Omicron virus. It is affecting restaurants and cafes. This is especially true before Christmas.

The number of people eating in restaurants went down. It went down by 14% in one week. This was compared to the same week in 2019. 2019 was before the virus started.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) collects data. They use information from websites like OpenTable. The ONS said people are eating out less. They are also working from home more. This is because there are more virus cases. The government has also asked people to be careful.

Many people are cancelling their restaurant bookings. The drop in diners was the biggest since September. It was the lowest number since restaurants opened again. Restaurants had closed during the winter lockdown. This was in England, Scotland, and Wales. This is also the first time the number of diners is less than in 2019.

Restaurants in London are suffering the most. The number of diners went down a lot. Now, it is only 57% of what it was in 2019. In Manchester, the number of diners is higher than in 2019.

The ONS said more people are working from home. About 14% of companies said their staff are working from home. This is affecting businesses that need customers.

People are buying less from shops like Pret a Manger. In London, sales are much lower than before the virus. Sales in other towns are doing better. But London is affected the most.

Shops are doing better than restaurants. The number of people going to shops is 81% of what it was in 2019. People are using their credit and debit cards more than last year. It is up by 4%.

The government knows businesses are having problems. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced money to help them. He will give £1 billion to businesses that are struggling because of Omicron."

Andrew Goodwin, a UK economist at the consultancy firm Oxford Economics, said: “Though the government has opted to defer a decision on introducing further restrictions until after Christmas, it seems likely that a mix of greater consumer caution and reduced mobility will ensure that the UK’s GDP falls in December.”","Here's the rewritten text, focusing on simple language and B2 level comprehension:

Andrew Goodwin works for a company called Oxford Economics. He studies the UK economy. He said something important.

He thinks people will be more careful with their money. They may not go out as much. This means the UK's economy, which is called GDP, will likely go down in December.

The government has not decided if they will make new rules before Christmas. But even without new rules, the economy could still get worse. People being careful and not going out much can hurt the economy."
81,81_0,0,"Ikea has increased the price of its flat-pack furniture by up to 50%, blaming supply chain costs caused by Covid-19, in a move that will further stoke growing concern about the rising cost of living. After customers complained that prices appeared to have risen sharply after Christmas, the retailer said it was no longer able to absorb increased costs and was passing them on to consumers. An Ikea spokesperson tweeted: “Unfortunately, there has been a significant increase in costs across the supply chain, including in raw materials, transport and logistics. As this is still ongoing, it is necessary to increase prices across many of our products.” Archived versions of Ikea’s website from as recently as October showed significant price increases, including a Malm desk that has gone up from £99 to £150, a jump of more than 50%. A Jokkmokk table with four chairs is also up 50%, from £99 to £149, compared with earlier this year. A Hemnes daybed has gone up from £215 to £279, a 30% rise, while an Alex nine-drawer unit increased 35% from £85 to £115, according to archived versions of the Ikea website from earlier this year. A Kura children’s bed was up by 14% from £129 to £150, while Ikea’s Klippan sofa, one of the Swedish store’s most popular items, is £20 more expensive – a rise of 11% – at £199. Ikea confirmed that the company had raised prices across multiple countries and ranges. A spokesperson said: “Since the start of the pandemic, Ikea has managed to absorb the significant cost increases experienced across the supply chain while keeping prices as low and stable as we possibly can. Now, like many other retailers, we have had to raise our prices to mitigate the impact on our business. “Price increases vary but remain in line with what we are seeing globally at Ikea, which is approximately a 9% average increase across countries and the product range. Affordability remains at the heart of our business, and our focus will always be on continuing to offer quality, sustainable home furnishings at an affordable price for the many people.” Ikea warned earlier this year that prices would rise, citing factors including bottlenecks in shipping raw materials from Asia to Europe.","Ikea has made its furniture more expensive. Some items now cost up to 50% more. This is because of problems with getting materials and shipping them. These problems are linked to Covid-19. This makes people worry about the cost of things going up.

People noticed that prices at Ikea went up a lot after Christmas. Ikea said they could not pay for the extra costs themselves anymore. So, they are making customers pay more.

An Ikea person said that it costs more to get materials. It also costs more to move them around. Because of this, Ikea has to raise prices on many things.

Old versions of the Ikea website show that prices have gone up. For example, a Malm desk used to cost £99. Now it costs £150. That is a big increase.

A Jokkmokk table with four chairs also costs 50% more. It used to be £99, but now it is £149.

A Hemnes bed used to cost £215. Now it costs £279. That is a 30% increase. An Alex drawer unit went from £85 to £115.

A Kura bed for children now costs £150. It used to cost £129. The Klippan sofa is also more expensive. It now costs £199. It used to cost £20 less.

Ikea said that prices have gone up in many countries and on many products. They have tried to keep prices low during the Covid-19 pandemic. But now they have to raise prices. This is to protect their business.

The price increases are different for each item. But on average, prices have gone up about 9% across all countries and products. Ikea says they still want to sell good furniture at prices that people can afford.

Ikea said earlier that prices would probably go up. They said it was hard to get materials from Asia to Europe. This also made things more expensive."

It blamed a profit warning on factory shutdowns in Vietnam, clogged ports and extended shipping times. Rising prices at Ikea come amid broader concern about the cost of living, after UK inflation hit a 10-year high of 5.1% in November. Soaring energy bills and rising taxes prompted 2022 to be dubbed the “year of the squeeze” by a thinktank report published this week.","The furniture business has problems. Many things are late.

Made.com is a shop that sells furniture online. They said that orders worth 45 million pounds are late. This is because factories in Vietnam closed. Also, the ports are full and ships take a long time. This made them warn that they might not make as much money as they thought.

Ikea is also raising prices. This is happening because things are costing more in general. The cost of living in the UK has gone up a lot. In November, it was the highest it has been in 10 years. It went up by 5.1%.

Energy bills are going up a lot. Taxes are also increasing. A report said that 2022 will be a hard year for people because of these costs. They called it the “year of the squeeze.”"
82,82_0,0,"The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices. The energy industry believes the crisis, during which more than 26 energy suppliers have gone bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. Other interventions the industry would like to see considered include extending fuel grants and moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation. Trade body Energy UK said on Thursday that consumers could expect their bills to soar by as much as 50% from 1 April. While wholesale prices continue to climb steeply, the UK’s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers. The price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been at a record £1,277 Since 1 October. Ofgem is expected to raise the cap significantly on 1 April. EDF has said the cap could hit £2,000 by next October, when the cap is reviewed again. Analysts at Investec believe the expected bill increase in April would add 1.8 percentage points to inflation next year. On Thursday, the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the expected £600 rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up. One plan being formulated by the energy industry to would involve a government-administered loan scheme to spread the impact of the price increases over several years.","The government will have important meetings soon. They will talk to the leaders of the biggest energy companies in the UK. The energy companies said there is a big problem. This problem could make energy bills go up a lot. Bills might increase by more than 50%. This means some people could pay £2,000 each year.

Kwasi Kwarteng is in charge of business. He will talk to the energy companies online on Monday. The companies want the government to help. They want the government to stop the big increase in energy bills for people. The price of gas has gone up a lot. This is why bills are getting more expensive.

Many energy companies have closed. More than 26 companies have closed. This has cost £1.8 billion so far. The energy industry thinks the government could help. They want the government to stop charging VAT on energy bills. VAT is a tax of 5%. The UK had this tax when it was part of the European Union.

The energy industry has other ideas too. They want the government to give people more money to help with bills. They also want the government to pay for ""green things"" instead of people paying for them on their bills. ""Green things"" are things that help the environment.

Energy UK is a group that speaks for energy companies. They said that energy bills could go up a lot on April 1st. They could go up by 50%.

The price of gas is still going up. But there is a limit on how much energy companies can charge people. This limit is called a ""price cap."" The price cap stops companies from charging people too much right away. The price cap is set by Ofgem. Ofgem makes rules for the energy industry. The price cap has been £1,277 since October 1st. Ofgem will probably raise the price cap on April 1st.

EDF is an energy company. They think the price cap could be £2,000 by next October. The price cap is checked again in October.

Some experts think that the higher bills in April will make prices go up in general. This is called inflation. They think inflation will go up by 1.8% next year.

Ed Miliband is a politician. He wants the government to help families. He does not want families to pay much more for heating and electricity. He wants the government to stop charging VAT on energy bills for six months.

Spain has lowered taxes on energy. Germany has lowered the cost of ""green things"" on people's bills. These ""green things"" help make clean energy. But Energy UK said these changes would not save people much money. They would save less than £300. The average energy bill is expected to go up by £600.

The energy industry is thinking about a plan. In this plan, the government would give loans to energy companies. This would make the price increases happen slowly over several years."
82,82_1,1,"The plan would involve one or more commercial lenders – such as banks – covering the immediate cost of buying energy on wholesale markets at record prices, with a sum of at least £7bn. The loans would not require a government guarantee, but officials would be responsible for ensuring repayments. “We regularly engage with the energy industry and will continue to ensure that consumers are protected through the energy price cap, which is insulating millions from record global gas prices,” a government spokesperson said. “We also continue to support those most in need through our £500mhousehold support fund, the warm home discount and winter fuel payments.”","Here's the rewritten text at a B2 CEFR level:

Energy companies need money. They need to buy energy now. The price of energy is very high.

One idea is for banks to give them loans. These loans would help them buy energy. The amount of money needed is at least £7 billion.

The government would not promise to pay back the loans. But, government workers would make sure the banks get their money back.

A government person said they talk to energy companies often. They want to protect people from high energy prices. There is a limit on how much energy companies can charge. This helps many people.

The government also helps people who need money. They have a fund of £500 million. This fund helps people pay for heating. Some people also get money to help with heating in the winter."
83,83_0,0,"On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gave a mid-year economic update predicting a solid economic bounceback from Covid restrictions. We’ve looked under the hood to see what the treasury’s crystal ball says is in store for the economy, what might go wrong, and how government finances will fare if they’re right. Forecasts The budget papers project the Australian economy will grow in real terms by 3.75% in 2021-22 and 3.5% in 2022-23, before easing back to 2.25% and 2.5% in the final two years of the forward projections. The unemployment rate is tipped to fall to 4.25% in that time. The treasury thinks Australians will be ambitious with their pay demands and bosses generous in a bid to keep workers, because wages growth is supposed to take off from 2.25% in 2021-22 to 3.25% in 2024-25. Inflation is projected to reach and stay at the mid-point of the reserve bank’s target range (2.5%) in 2022-23. Assumptions The treasury has assumed that with more than 80% of Australians aged 16 and above now vaccinated, rates will climb to more than 90%. So far so good. But the rest of the assumptions are … a little rosy. The treasury assumed lockdowns will no longer be required, with “most domestic activity restrictions” lifted by the start of 2022 and only basic density restrictions in place. There may be “temporary strengthening of activity restrictions” to contain localised outbreaks – but these short, sharp lockdown-like restrictions are assumed to have no material impact on the outlook. Remaining state border restrictions are assumed to be lifted by early 2022 and the Omicron variant “is not assumed to significantly alter current reopening plans or require a reimposition of widespread health and activity restrictions”. Migrants will start returning from 2022, with international students ready to go for the first semester of next year. What could go wrong In a word: Covid. If a new variant of concern emerges (beyond Omicron) requiring more significant health responses, the international border could be closed for another six months and public health orders and precautionary behaviour could drive down spending.","On Thursday, Josh Frydenberg spoke about the economy. He is the treasurer. He said the economy will get better after the Covid rules.

We looked at what the government thinks about the economy. We wanted to know what could happen. We also wanted to know if the government's plans will work.

The government thinks the economy will grow. It will grow by 3.75% this year. Next year, it will grow by 3.5%. After that, it will grow slower. In the last two years, it will grow by 2.25% and 2.5%.

The government thinks the unemployment rate will go down. It will go down to 4.25%.

The government also thinks people will want more money. Bosses will give them more money to keep them working. Wages will grow from 2.25% to 3.25% in a few years.

The government thinks prices will go up. This is called inflation. It will reach 2.5% in 2022-23. This is the middle of what the Reserve Bank wants.

The government is making some guesses. They think that most people will get vaccinated. More than 80% of people over 16 have already had the vaccine. The government thinks it will go up to 90%. This is good so far.

But other guesses might not be right. The government thinks there will be no more lockdowns. They think most rules will be gone by the start of 2022. There might be some small rules about how many people can be in a place.

They think there might be some short lockdowns if there are small outbreaks. But they think these lockdowns will not hurt the economy much.

The government thinks state borders will open soon. They also think the Omicron virus will not change the plans to open up. They don't think it will make them put rules back in place.

The government thinks people will start coming to Australia again in 2022. International students will be ready to come to school next year.

What could go wrong? The biggest problem is Covid. If a new virus comes, it could be bad. The borders might close again for six months. People might be scared and not spend money."
83,83_1,1,"The treasury projects this could mean 1% is shaved off gross domestic product in 2021-22, and unemployment is about 1% higher. The rebound would instead come in the second half of 2022. The papers also note that revenue assumptions and nominal GDP are also sensitive to changes in the iron ore price, with a US$10 fall shaving $3.9bn off GDP this year and $0.9bn off tax receipts next financial year. If the government has to pay higher interest rates on bonds, then debt could blow out by a further 5.4% of GDP by 2032. $16bn of mystery spending The budget papers reveal that there is about $16bn of mystery spending over the next four years, consisting of decisions taken but not announced, or measures for which the cost is not-for-publication. That’s more than 10 times the size of mystery spending last year. The papers make it impossible to calculate the size of the war chest for announcements to be made before the election, by mixing in a bunch of commercially sensitive spending items like vaccine purchases. But a treasury official in the lockup suggested it was about half and half … so, an $8bn war chest for the election. There will also be $940m more revenue collected due to decisions taken but not announced or not for publication measures. Debt and deficit For a government previously concerned with the debt and deficit disaster, there is still red as far as the eye can see. The deficit is tipped to be $99.2bn in 2021-22, an improvement of $7.4bn since the budget despite the Delta lockdowns. The deficit will still be $57.5bn in 2024-25 (or 2.3% of GDP), and only shrinks to 1.8% of GDP in 2031-32. Net debt is projected to be 30.6% of GDP at June 2022, rising to a peak of 37.4% in 2025, then down to 35.5% in 2032. The papers say that despite the economic recovery the government is sticking with the first plank of its budget plan – strong and sustained recovery – so don’t expect austerity measures to try to cut the debt and deficit.","Okay, here's a B2 level rewrite of the text, following your instructions:

The government thinks things might not be so good. The economy might grow less. They think the economy could grow 1% less than expected in 2021 and 2022. Also, more people might lose their jobs. About 1% more people could be unemployed. The economy might get better again in the second half of 2022.

The government also makes money from iron ore. If the price of iron ore goes down, the government will have less money. If the price goes down by $10, the economy will lose $3.9 billion this year. Next year, the government will get $0.9 billion less in taxes.

The government borrows money by selling bonds. If the government has to pay more interest on these bonds, the country's debt could get much bigger. The debt could increase by 5.4% of the total economy by 2032.

The budget papers show some spending that is not explained. There is $16 billion of spending that is secret. This money is for things the government has decided to do, but they have not told anyone yet. Or, they do not want to say how much these things cost. This secret spending is much bigger than last year. It is more than ten times bigger.

It is hard to know how much money the government has for announcements before the election. This is because they have mixed secret spending with things that are private. For example, they are buying vaccines. However, someone from the government said that about half of the $16 billion is for the election. So, they might have $8 billion to spend before the election.

The government will also get more money. They will get $940 million more because of decisions they have made. But they have not told anyone about these decisions.

The government used to worry a lot about debt. But now, the country is still losing money. The government will lose $99.2 billion in 2021 and 2022. This is better than they thought, because of the Delta lockdowns. In 2024 and 2025, the government will still lose $57.5 billion. This is 2.3% of the total economy. In 2031 and 2032, they will still be losing 1.8% of the total economy.

The country's debt is also going up. It will be 30.6% of the total economy in June 2022. It will go up to 37.4% in 2025. Then, it will go down to 35.5% in 2032.

The government says the economy is getting better. But they will still follow their plan to help the economy grow. So, they will not cut spending to reduce the debt."
84,84_0,0,"Britons are many times more likely to have experienced shortages of food and fuel than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll. Global supply chain problems prompted by the pandemic have disrupted the international trade network since the summer, with transport backlogs combining with labour shortages to create scarcities of various goods around the world. The government has argued that the shortages are part of a worldwide pattern and no worse in the UK than elsewhere, although logistics experts and other professionals – particularly in the food sector - have said the problems are amplified in Britain by a shortage of east European workers, including drivers, since Brexit. The YouGov poll showed residents of the UK were multiple times more likely to have experienced, or to know people who have experienced, shortages of food and fuel than people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, and somewhat more likely to have experienced them than those in the US. Asked in early December whether they had personally experienced any scarcity of foodstuffs in recent weeks, 56% of respondents in the UK said yes, while 9% said they had not personally experienced any but knew people who had. The corresponding figures in the US were 49% and 10%, but in continental Europe, the proportion of people who said they had been personally affected was between three and nine times lower: 18% in Germany, 16% in France, 12% in Sweden, 8% in Denmark, 7% and 6% in Italy. The proportion saying they knew people who had experienced food shortages ranged from 13% in France to 8% in Denmark and Italy – where 58% of respondents said they were not even aware that supply chain problems had led to food shortages. The UK was also the only country where substantial numbers of people said they had experienced fuel shortages in recent weeks, since the crisis in September and October. One in three Britons (33%) said they had personally experienced a recent scarcity of fuel, compared with no more than 10% in any other country. Only 8% of German respondents, 7% of those in France and 5% of those in Italy said they had been personally experienced fuel scarcity, with 37%, 38% and 53% respectively saying they had not even heard of the issue – compared with just 11% of respondents in Britain.","A survey showed that people in the UK had more problems getting food and fuel. This was compared to people in some countries in Europe.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused problems with global trade. It was hard to move goods around the world. There were not enough workers, and things were delayed. This caused a shortage of some things.

The UK government said that other countries also had these shortages. But some experts said the UK had more problems. They said that after Brexit, there were not enough workers from Eastern Europe, like drivers.

The survey asked people if they had problems getting food and fuel. Many more people in the UK said yes, compared to people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark. More people in the UK also had problems compared to people in the US.

In the UK, 56% of people said they had trouble getting food. Another 9% said they did not, but they knew people who did.

In the US, 49% of people had problems, and 10% knew people who did.

But in Europe, fewer people had problems. Only 18% in Germany, 16% in France, 12% in Sweden, 8% in Denmark, 7% in Spain, and 6% in Italy had problems getting food.

Some people in Europe did not even know there was a problem. For example, 58% of people in Italy did not know about food shortages.

The UK also had problems with fuel. One in three people in the UK (33%) said they had trouble getting fuel. This happened after problems in September and October.

In other countries, much fewer people had problems. Only 8% in Germany, 7% in France, and 5% in Italy had trouble getting fuel. Many people in these countries did not even know about the fuel problem. 37% in Germany, 38% in France and 53% in Italy did not know about it. Only 11% of people in the UK did not know about the fuel problem."

From January, Just Eat customers will be able to add a range of products to their baskets starting with five Asda stores, with the exact locations to be announced in the new year. “We live in an on-demand world,” said Andrew Kenny, the UK managing director of Just Eat. “We want to make sure we are getting our customers the food they want, when they want, when they want it. Our tie-up with Asda means we can help people access everything from store cupboard essentials to fresh groceries in a matter of minutes.” Just Eat follows rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats, which already have fast delivery deals with some of the UK’s biggest supermarkets. Best-known for restaurant and fast food delivery, Just Eat said that up to 1,000 grocery items would be made available for customers to order seven days a week. The two companies anticipate the partnership to be extended to more Asda stores throughout next year. The partnership builds on an existing relationship, with Just Eat delivering pizzas and meal deals from Asda Kitchen, the grocer’s indoor cafe and diner, which operates at 42 locations nationwide. “We’re always looking for new ways to offer customers more choice and extend the number of delivery options available,” said Simon Gregg, the vice-president of online grocery at Asda. “The trial will also see Asda become more accessible to a wider customer base through Just Eat’s significant presence in the on-demand food delivery space.” Just Eat has more than 60,000 restaurant partners it offers a delivery service for, covering 95% of the UK. The food delivery service has more than 10,000 grocery and convenience store partners on its platform internationally, including brands such as Spar, Shell and 7-Eleven. Last month, Asda appointed Stuart Rose, the Conservative peer and former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, as chairman.","Just Eat will now deliver groceries. They are working with Asda, a big supermarket in the UK. This is the first time Just Eat has worked with a supermarket in the UK.

Starting in January, people can buy food from Asda on the Just Eat app. At first, only five Asda stores will be part of this. We will know which stores later.

Andrew Kenny works for Just Eat. He said people want things quickly. He wants Just Eat to give people the food they want, when they want it. Working with Asda means people can get food and other things from the store very fast.

Other companies like Deliveroo and Uber Eats already deliver groceries from supermarkets. Just Eat is now doing the same.

Just Eat is known for delivering food from restaurants. Now, they will also deliver up to 1,000 grocery items. People can order these items every day of the week.

Just Eat and Asda think they will add more Asda stores to the app later.

Just Eat already delivers food from Asda Kitchen. Asda Kitchen is a cafe inside some Asda stores. There are 42 Asda Kitchens in the UK.

Simon Gregg works for Asda. He said Asda wants to give customers more choices. This new delivery service will help more people buy from Asda. Just Eat delivers to many people.

Just Eat works with over 60,000 restaurants in the UK. They deliver to most of the country. Just Eat also works with many grocery stores in other countries, like Spar, Shell, and 7-Eleven.

Recently, Asda chose Stuart Rose to be their chairman. He used to work for another store called Marks & Spencer."

86,86_1,1,"The FTSE 100 is wavering around a 1.1% decline for the day - perhaps it is waiting for direction from the UK cabinet, which is about to meet. However, any leaks (or indeed official messages) are likely to come very near the end of the trading day, if not after. The Dax in Germany is down by 1.8% and France’s Cac 40 has lost 1.1%. The Stoxx 600, which combines all of the above and more, is down by 1.5%. Britain’s largest pub chain JD Wetherspoon has appointed two employees to its board in response to criticisms of its corporate governance. Four out of about 100 managers of Spoons pubs were chosen after shareholders and employees said it would “benefit from having more pub experience at board level”, the company said on Monday. Debbie Whittingham, a regional manager for the West Midlands, and Hudson Simmons, area manager for Sheffield, will join the board, while another two will be “associate employee directors”. Tim Martin, Wetherspoon’s founder and chairman, has previously lashed out at those who have criticised the company’s corporate governance in lengthy letters published on the stock market’s news service. However, he said: Pub and area managers, and other members of pub teams, have always participated in weekly decision-making meetings, which distil suggestions from the ‘front line’. The appointment of employee directors will extend this approach to board meetings and will help to preserve the culture of the company for the future. It was cautiously welcomed by the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance. Luke Hildyard, the High Pay Centre’s executive director, said: The perspectives workers directors can offer in terms of improvements to customer service and employee relations are obvious. The new Wetherspoons directors would have more credibility and independence if they’d been elected by colleagues rather than appointed by existing board members and it should also be remembered that boardroom representation is a complement not a substitute for full trade union rights and recognition. But this is a positive step by Wetherspoons that will benefit both workers and shareholders in the long term. One to watch on the UK politics front: the prime minister has called a cabinet meeting at 2pm.","The FTSE 100 is going down. It has lost about 1.1% today. Maybe it is waiting to see what the UK government will do. The government leaders will meet soon. But we might not know what they decide until the end of the day.

The Dax in Germany is also down. It has lost 1.8%. The Cac 40 in France is down too. It has lost 1.1%. The Stoxx 600 is a group of many companies. It is down by 1.5%.

A big pub company in Britain is called JD Wetherspoon. People said the company needed to be run better. So, Wetherspoon has added two workers to its board. The board is a group of people who make important decisions.

Some people who own shares in the company asked for this change. They thought the board needed people with more experience working in pubs.

Two managers from Wetherspoon pubs will join the board. One is Debbie Whittingham. She is a manager in the West Midlands. The other is Hudson Simmons. He is a manager in Sheffield. Two other workers will also help the board.

Tim Martin is the boss of Wetherspoon. He did not like it when people said the company was not run well. He wrote long letters about it. But now he says that the workers will help. They will share ideas from their work in the pubs. This will help the company in the future.

A group called the High Pay Centre studies how companies are run. They think this is a good idea. Luke Hildyard works there. He says that workers on the board can help make the company better. They can improve customer service and how the company treats workers.

But he thinks the workers should be chosen by other workers. He also says that workers should have the right to join a union. But he still thinks this is a good step for Wetherspoon. It will help the workers and the people who own shares in the company.

In UK politics, the Prime Minister will meet with the government at 2pm. It is something to watch."
86,86_2,2,"As Andrew Sparrow points out on the Guardian’s UK politics live blog, there is not usually a cabinet meeting on a Monday, so this is an emergency coronavirus meeting. Dress codes and wine pairings have not yet been released. You can follow updates on the cabinet here: One for the central bank watchers: Germany’s new government has picked a new head of its central bank: “career central banker” Joachim Nagel. Nagel’s predecessor, Jens Weidmann, was perhaps the European Central Bank’s most prominent internal critic -arguing against the stimulus that it has used to prop up the EU economy. (All eurozone central bank heads get a place on the governing council, which sets monetary policy for the bloc.) Nagel, a former Bundesbank board member, will take over on 1 January. Reuters summarised his recent career as: A former board member of the state-owned development bank KfW Bank, Nagel currently works for the Bank for International Settlements, which is often considered the central bank of central banks. Early in his career, he was also a consultant for the SPD, the party that took over government earlier this month and will make the Bundesbank appointment one of its first decisions. Germany’s finance minister under the new coalition government, Christian Lindner, said on Monday: In view of inflation risks, the importance of a stability-oriented monetary policy is growing. He is an experienced personality who ensures continuity at the Bundesbank. The World Economic Forum at Davos has been postponed to the summer because of concerns about the coronavirus variant, it said on Monday. The event, usually held every year at the Swiss ski resort, was scheduled for 17 to 21 January 2022, but will instead happen in “early summer”. In January the World Economic Forum will instead run online meetings. Davos usually serves as an occasion for many of the world’s most powerful people from the realms of business, economics and politics to gather and pontificate about the world’s problems. However, the meeting of thousands of people from all over the world has been difficult to continue during pandemic conditions. The 2021 event was cancelled in favour of online events in the summer.","Here are the news updates.

Andrew Sparrow wrote on the Guardian's blog. He said there is a special meeting today. It is about the coronavirus. Usually, the cabinet does not meet on Mondays. We do not know what people will wear or drink at the meeting yet. You can find updates about the cabinet online.

Germany has a new leader for its central bank. His name is Joachim Nagel. He has worked at central banks for a long time. The old leader was Jens Weidmann. He did not agree with the European Central Bank very often. He did not like the plan to help the EU economy. Each country in the Eurozone has a leader on the group that decides money rules. Nagel used to work for the Bundesbank. He will start his new job on January 1st.

Reuters news said that Nagel used to work for KfW Bank. Now, he works for the Bank for International Settlements. This bank is for other central banks. Early in his career, he helped the SPD party. This party is now in power. They will choose the new Bundesbank leader. This is one of their first decisions.

Christian Lindner is Germany's finance minister. He said that it is important to keep money stable because of inflation. He said Nagel is experienced and will keep the Bundesbank steady.

The World Economic Forum in Davos will not happen in January. It is now planned for the summer. This is because people are worried about the coronavirus. The meeting was supposed to be from January 17th to 21st, 2022. Now, it will be in ""early summer"".

In January, the World Economic Forum will have online meetings instead. Usually, important people meet in Davos. They talk about problems in the world. These people are from business, economics, and politics. But it is hard to have this meeting with so many people during the pandemic. The 2021 event was cancelled. They had online meetings in the summer instead."
86,86_3,3,"In a statement, the event’s organisers said: Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting. Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary. The number of shoppers across British high streets fell over the weekend before Christmas, according to new data from Springboard that show people spurned city centre shopping during what should have been the biggest weekend of the year. Retail footfall was 19% down for the week ending on Saturday compared to the equivalent in 2019, Springboard said - although it was higher than December 2020, when the UK government dramatically u-turned to put in place a Christmas lockdown. Shopping centres fared particularly badly, with footfall down by 27% on 2019, but high streets were also down by a fifth on 2019. Retail parks, which are generally accessed by private car and are often open-air, performed slightly better. Weekend traffic overall fell compared to the previous weekend by 8.5% in Central London and by 6.4% in cities outside of the capital. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: The nervousness of shoppers about making in-person shopping visits inevitably meant that large city centres lost out to smaller high streets, particularly over the weekend when footfall declined from the week before in Central London and large cities outside of the capital whilst rising in market towns. There has been a bit of movement on currency markets as well this morning: sterling is down by 0.4% against the US dollar. One pound will buy $1.3195. That in itself is not a huge move, but it puts the pound perilously close to its lowest level since December 2020, when the UK was facing the prospect of belated Christmas restrictions in the hope of limiting the spread of a new coronavirus variant (a familiar tale). If it drops below $1.3165 it will mark a new low for 2021, an unusual situation considering the Bank of England only just last week shocked markets with an interest rate rise - pre-empting the Federal Reserve. However, the Fed has itself also made it clear that it will tighten the US money supply. The prospect of a series of interest rate rises next year has made the dollar more attractive to investors.","The people who planned an event said something. They said it is hard to have a meeting where people come together from all over the world. This is because of the virus.

They had rules to keep people healthy at the meeting. But the virus spreads easily. It also makes it hard for people to travel. So, they had to move the meeting to a later time.

Many stores are in areas called ""high streets"" in Britain. A company called Springboard has new information. It shows that fewer people went to these stores before Christmas. The weekend before Christmas should be the busiest time for shopping. But people did not go to the city centers to shop.

Springboard said that the number of shoppers was lower than in 2019. It was 19% lower for the week that ended on Saturday. But it was higher than in December 2020. At that time, the government changed its mind and made rules for a Christmas lockdown.

Shopping centers did not do well. The number of shoppers was 27% lower than in 2019. High streets also had fewer shoppers. They were down by 20% compared to 2019.

Retail parks did a little better. People usually drive to these parks in their own cars. These parks are often outside.

The number of cars on the road was lower than the week before. It was down by 8.5% in the center of London. It was down by 6.4% in other cities in Britain.

Diane Wehrle works for Springboard. She said that people were worried about shopping in person. This means that big city centers lost shoppers to smaller high streets. On the weekend, fewer people went to shop in central London and big cities. But more people went to market towns.

The value of money has changed a little. The British pound is worth less than before compared to the American dollar. It is down by 0.4%.

One pound can buy $1.3195. This is not a big change. But the pound is close to being worth the least it has been since December 2020. At that time, Britain might have had new Christmas rules. This was to stop a new type of the virus from spreading.

If the pound goes below $1.3165, it will be worth the least it has been in 2021. This is strange because the Bank of England surprised everyone last week. They raised the interest rate. This was before the American Federal Reserve did.

The Federal Reserve has also said that it will make less money available. They might raise interest rates next year. This makes the American dollar more attractive to people who invest money."

There has also been a similar bounce on oil markets. The price of Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, is still down by 3.3% today - but that is a recovery from earlier. Brent crude futures were down by as much as 5% earlier this morning, with one barrel for February delivery going for as little as $69. It is now back at $71.30. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, an investing platform, said: Heavy selling has hit the oil markets again this week with WTI and Brent crude both shedding more than 3% extending losses after a week in the red with Brent already ending down 2.6% as the Omicron variant continues to spread, weighing on the demand outlook and market sentiment. The Netherlands’ latest lockdown from Sunday sparked investor concerns of fresh restrictions in Europe and the US to curb the spread of Covid, prompting fears of a near-term economic slowdown. Brent crude has shed more than 17% from the October high, trading in a descending trendline and retracing around 70% of its prior gains from the August trough. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Société Générale, a bank, is in a festive mood - albeit the wrong feast. “It’s a lot more like Halloween than Christmas,” he said: Oil prices, equity indices and bond yields are lower on a mix of omicron concerns and Senator Joe Manchin’s announcement that he won’t vote for President Biden’s spending bill. Just over half an hour after the FTSE 100 slumped further, it has just regained a percentage point. It is now down by just 1.3% at 7,179 points, having earlier dropped by as much as 2.2%. European stocks have also recovered somewhat: Germany’s Dax is now down by 2.2% and France’s Cac 40 is down 1.4%. All the usual disclaimers apply at this point in the year: a fair few investors will have shut up shop for the holidays, and few of those who remain will have planned any major moves in the absence of central bank activity.","Mark Haefele works for UBS. He helps people invest money. He said the dollar will do well in 2022. This is because the world economy will grow. It will be good even if the Omicron virus spreads.

Oil prices have also changed a lot. The price of Brent crude oil went down. Brent crude is oil from the North Sea. Today, its price is down by 3.3%. But it was lower earlier.

This morning, the price was down by 5%. One barrel of oil for February cost $69. Now it costs $71.30.

Victoria Scholar works for a company called interactive investor. This company helps people invest. She said many people are selling oil this week. The prices of WTI and Brent crude have gone down a lot. They went down last week too. This is because the Omicron virus is spreading. People think it will make the demand for oil lower. They also feel worried about the economy.

The Netherlands started a new lockdown on Sunday. This made investors worry. They think other countries in Europe and the US might also have new rules. This could stop the economy from growing quickly. The price of Brent crude has gone down a lot since October.

Kit Juckes works for a bank called Société Générale. He said things feel bad, like Halloween. He said oil prices are lower. Stock prices are also lower. Bond yields are lower too. This is because people are worried about the Omicron virus. Also, a Senator named Joe Manchin said he will not vote for President Biden's spending plan.

The FTSE 100 is a list of big companies. It went down a lot earlier. Now it has gone up a little. It is now down by 1.3% at 7,179 points. Before, it was down by 2.2%.

European stocks have also gone up a little. Germany's Dax is now down by 2.2%. France's Cac 40 is down by 1.4%.

Many investors are not working now. They are on holiday. The people who are working are not making big changes. They are waiting to see what the central banks will do."
86,86_5,5,"That means that there will be lower liquidity and fewer buyers to soak up any sales, so moves can be exaggerated. Nevertheless, that is a notable swing over the course of less than an hour. It may have been partly helped by vaccine maker Moderna. It said on Monday (in an interview published at 10am GMT) that a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to offer protection against the omicron variant. Reuters reported: The vaccine maker said the decision to focus on the current vaccine, mRNA-1273, was driven in part by how quickly the recently discovered variant is spreading. The company still plans to develop a vaccine specifically to protect against Omicron, which it hopes to advance into clinical trials early next year. “What we have available right now is 1273,” Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer, said in an interview. “It’s highly effective, and it’s extremely safe. I think it will protect people through the coming holiday period and through these winter months, when we’re going to see the most severe pressure of Omicron.” Some detail on how the UK’s shops fared over the last week - usually one of the the strongest of the year: it was not great. Footfall on and near London’s Oxford Street, the country’s biggest shopping district, was 17% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the New West End Company, which represents about 600 shops. Shopping was 5% below the previous weekend, and across the entire week of the 13th December footfall was down by 29% compared with 2019’s figures. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said businesses were “disappointed” with how the weekend went: With less than five days to go until Christmas day and the probabilities of a circuit-breaker lockdown increasingly on the horizon, the retail and leisure sector is now facing a huge amount of financial uncertainty when it should be enjoying a much needed shot in the arm. We are therefore backing the #BusinessBooster campaign and calling on the government to provide urgent and swift financial support. Temporary measures such as a 100% business rate relief for the first quarter of the year, extension of the VAT reduction and introduction of grants could be the difference between viable businesses avoiding closures and job losses in the new year.","It means there will be less money available in the market. Also, fewer people will want to buy things. This can make price changes bigger and faster.

However, the price change we saw was still important. It happened in less than one hour.

The company Moderna might have helped cause this change. Moderna makes vaccines. On Monday, they said something important. They said that a booster shot of their COVID-19 vaccine seemed to protect against the Omicron virus. This information was in an interview published at 10 am GMT.

Reuters reported on this. They said Moderna decided to focus on their current vaccine, mRNA-1273. This is because the Omicron virus is spreading so fast.

Moderna still plans to make a new vaccine. This new vaccine will protect specifically against Omicron. They hope to start testing it early next year.

Dr. Paul Burton works for Moderna. He is the Chief Medical Officer. He said the current vaccine, 1273, is very good. He said it works well and is very safe. He thinks it will protect people during the holidays. He also thinks it will help during the winter months. Omicron will be a big problem then.

Here is some news about shops in the UK. We will look at how they did last week. Usually, this is one of the best weeks of the year for shops. But this year, it was not good.

Oxford Street is in London. It is the biggest shopping area in the country. The number of people visiting shops there was down by 17%. This is compared to before the virus. This information comes from the New West End Company. They represent about 600 shops.

Shopping was also down 5% compared to the weekend before. For the whole week of December 13th, the number of people shopping was down 29%. This is compared to the same time in 2019.

Jace Tyrrell is the chief executive of the New West End Company. He said that businesses were ""disappointed"" with the weekend.

Christmas is coming soon. There is a chance the government will close businesses again. This makes things very uncertain for shops and businesses. They need money now. They should be making money at this time of year.

That is why they support the #BusinessBooster campaign. They are asking the government to give them money quickly.

The government could do some things to help. They could stop businesses from paying some taxes for a few months. They could also give them grants. This could help businesses stay open and keep people from losing their jobs next year."
86,86_6,6,"The FTSE 100 sell-off has accelerated - it is now down by 2.2%. It has hit the lowest level since the start of December as concern over the spread of the omicron variant ramp up. While the UK government is fielding a lot of questions about parties, the hospitality industry is trying to put the pressure on over the lack of them, given how the current lockdown-lite has affected their bookings. The Guardian’s Joanna Partridge writes: Pubs and restaurants have warned of plummeting sales and “decimated” bookings, as pressure increases on the government to offer urgent financial support to struggling hospitality businesses. The weekend just passed should have been the busiest trading period of the Christmas season, but customers chose to stay away, said Nick Mackenzie, the chief executive of the pub and brewery chain Greene King, which runs 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK. “Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, some parts of the country we are 70%, 80% down on 2019, so the situation is pretty unsustainable,” Mackenzie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. Warnings from the government had led to “lockdown in all but name”, Mackenzie said, and he urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to deliver “quick and effective support”. You can read the full report here: Some interesting detail from the notice detailing the reasons for the errors Standard Chartered made. One key reporting problem was caused by a spreadsheet error in which a workers put the wrong sign - so it read as positive rather than negative. Sure, we all make that kind of mistake, except in this case the error meant the calculation was out by a staggering $10bn. That sounds like a very bad day at the office indeed. Standard Chartered will have to pay £46.5m after it failed to cooperate with regulators at the Bank of England. It was a record fine imposed by the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is tasked with overseeing the UK banking sector’s financial stability. The fines came in relation to reporting errors related to movements of US dollars, amid concerns in October 2017 about the outflow of cash.","The FTSE 100 is going down fast. It is now down by 2.2%. This is the lowest it has been since December. People are worried about the Omicron virus spreading.

The UK government is answering questions about parties. At the same time, the hospitality industry is worried. They are not getting many customers. This is because of the current rules, which are like a mild lockdown.

Joanna Partridge from The Guardian writes about this. Pubs and restaurants say their sales are going down a lot. Many people are cancelling their bookings. They want the government to give them money to help.

Last weekend should have been the busiest time for them. It is usually the Christmas season. But people stayed home instead. Nick Mackenzie is in charge of Greene King. This company owns many pubs, restaurants, and hotels in the UK. He said that business is very bad.

Mr. Mackenzie said that fewer people are coming. Many bookings have been cancelled. In some places, business is down 70% or 80% compared to 2019. This is not sustainable.

Mr. Mackenzie said the government's warnings made it like a lockdown. He wants Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, to give them help quickly.

Standard Chartered bank made some mistakes. One mistake was in a computer spreadsheet. A worker put the wrong sign in a calculation. It should have been negative, but it was positive.

We all make mistakes. But this mistake made a big difference. The calculation was wrong by $10 billion. This was a very bad mistake for the bank.

Standard Chartered must pay £46.5 million. They did not help the people at the Bank of England who check on banks. This fine was the biggest ever given by the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The PRA watches over the banks in the UK to make sure they are safe.

The fines are because of mistakes in reporting. The bank made mistakes about moving US dollars. In 2017, people were worried about money leaving the bank."
