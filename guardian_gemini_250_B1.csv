Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim worked for Brazil in foreign affairs for many years. He reached the highest position. But he says 2019 was a very unusual year for Latin America. ""Like this? Never before,"" he said. He means there was a lot of trouble in many countries.

The year started with problems in Venezuela. People were angry and protested in the streets. They wanted to remove the leader, Nicolás Maduro. Many people thought he would lose his power soon. There were big protests and a failed army revolt. Juan Guaidó tried to remove Maduro, but he did not succeed. Things became calmer, but not for long.

In other countries, there were also many protests and violence. This happened in Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador, and Bolivia. In Bolivia, the president, Evo Morales, had to leave his job. The army used violence against the people. Some people thought this was like a ""Latin American Spring,"" meaning a time of big changes.

In Peru, the president closed the congress. In Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner came back to politics in a surprising way. In Colombia, many people protested against the president, Iván Duque.

Even Chile, which was usually a stable and rich country, had problems. The price of subway tickets went up. This made people very angry, and there were big riots. This was the worst trouble in Chile for many years. There was a lot of damage, and the president, Sebastián Piñera, had problems.

Ivan Briscoe, who works for the International Crisis Group, was surprised by the chaos in Chile. He said he felt like things were changing very fast in Latin America. A new year with more uncertainty was coming."
0,0_1,1,"“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","Things have been happening for many years. These things are now becoming clear in different places. This includes problems in Chile, Bolivia, and Venezuela. We don't know what will happen next.

Someone said he knows the important problems for next year. But he is not sure what will really happen.

Some people on the left side in Latin America are happy about this confusion. They think this trouble is a reaction from the people. They think the people are fighting against new ideas that are hurting countries like Colombia and Chile.

It is hard to know what will happen next. But things are different now. Before, it seemed like everything was becoming more right-wing. Now, things are not so clear. Even with all the problems, this is a little bit better.

Latin America is having a difficult time. But for the left side, this trouble is better than nothing happening at all.

The year is ending, and people are thinking about what will happen next year. A report says there is a big chance that protests will spread. Protests in Colombia were started by protests in other countries.

The report says that 2020 will be another difficult year for Latin America. Ecuador will have a very hard time. Someone said that Ecuador is like a bomb. It could explode again at any time.

Someone else said that there are three places where problems could start in 2020. First, Venezuela is getting worse with political problems and people needing help. Second, Brazil and Argentina are having problems between their leaders because they have different ideas. Third, Mexico has a big problem with people being killed. Almost 100 people are killed every day. The president is trying to fix this."
0,0_2,2,"Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.","In 2014, many people in Mexico protested. This happened because 43 students went missing. People were very upset. Someone named Briscoe said this could happen again if the violence did not stop.

Briscoe also thought there would be trouble in Bolivia. This would happen if Luis Fernando Camacho got to the second part of the election. Camacho is very conservative. He would be running against someone from Evo Morales’ party. Morales' party is on the left.

Briscoe said things could be difficult in many countries. He mentioned Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. He said things could go wrong in these places.

Briscoe said that there is a lot of anger in these societies. He said Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Chile could also have problems.

People have different ideas about Brazil. Brazil has the biggest economy in Latin America. Some people think there might be protests. Lula da Silva used to be the president. He told his supporters to do what people in Chile did. He wanted them to protest against the president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is on the far right.

Some people think that Bolsonaro's election in 2018 stopped people from protesting. They think it let people release their anger without going to the streets, for now.

But Monica de Bolle thinks Brazil could be next. She knows a lot about Latin America. She said that people might not protest right now. But things can change.

She thinks that soon people will see that the economy is not growing. She said this is because Bolsonaro does not have good plans. Then, people might not support Bolsonaro anymore.

She said this could cause problems like in the past. She mentioned the big protests in 2013. These protests led to Dilma Rousseff leaving her job three years later.

Amorim also thinks there could be trouble in Brazil. He thinks people will get angry at Bolsonaro because things are not going well."
0,0_3,3,"“There hasn’t yet been a popular reaction [against Bolsonaro] – but I think it will come. If there’s a small spark it could very easily propagate,” he said. But perhaps not quite yet. “Everything here in Brazil is slow,” Amorim admitted. “Except samba.”","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

People do not like Bolsonaro very much right now. But maybe they will show it soon. Amorim thinks this will happen. He thinks a small problem could make things much worse for Bolsonaro.

But maybe this will not happen very quickly. Amorim said that things in Brazil take a long time. He said everything is slow. But samba is not slow. Samba is fast."
1,1_0,0,"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago.","People were angry in Iraq. They went to the American embassy in Baghdad. The embassy is like the office of the American government in Iraq.

The people were protesting. They shouted, ""Death to America."" They also said things to support groups who like Iran.

It was a bad day for America. Many protesters went to the embassy. They broke the main gate. They broke into some rooms.

The protesters started fires. They hit doors and threw things at the windows.

It seems like the Iraqi police helped the protesters. The police let them into a safe area called the Green Zone. Then the protesters went to the embassy. They climbed walls and threw stones.

American guards used tear gas. They did not shoot.

Donald Trump is the President of America. He said that Iran planned the attack.

Before this, America attacked some places in Iraq and Syria. These places belonged to a group called Kata’ib Hezbollah. This group is supported by Iran and is part of the Iraqi army.

About 25 fighters died in the attacks. Many more were hurt.

America said they did the attacks to stop more bad things from happening. Before this, the group attacked an American base. One American was killed and four were hurt.

President Trump said it was okay to do the attacks.

But the attacks may not help America. They may be another mistake in the Middle East.

The Iraqi government was very angry about the attacks. Groups that like Iran said they will attack American places again. They want the American soldiers to leave Iraq.

Trump wrote on Twitter that Iran hurt an American. He said America will always respond strongly. He also said that Iran is attacking the American embassy. He said Iran will be responsible.

The American embassy said that the ambassador was not leaving. Some people said he left because of the protests. But the embassy said he was on vacation. He left a week ago."
1,1_1,1,"The embassy was under lockdown but had not been evacuated, the spokesperson said, with diplomats sheltering in a safe-room. Video from the scene showed thick grey smoke engulfing the compound against a backdrop of wailing from an emergency siren. Protesters shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. By nightfall fires were still burning. One masked man walked off insouciantly with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part.","The embassy was closed. People could not go in or out. But the embassy was not empty. A spokesperson said the diplomats were safe inside. They were in a safe room.

There was a lot of gray smoke. It was all around the embassy. There was a loud siren. It sounded like an emergency.

People were protesting. They were shouting. They shouted, ""No, no, America!"" They shouted, ""No, no, Trump!"" They also shouted, ""Death to America!""

It was night. The fires were still burning. One man had a mask on. He walked away with a sign. It was a sign from the US embassy. He didn't seem to care.

Some people who used to work at the embassy said this was like something that happened in 1979. Then, the US embassy in Tehran was attacked. Fifty-two Americans were taken. They were held as hostages.

But Tuesday was not as bad. Nobody died. Most of the embassy was okay. But there is still a big problem. The US and Iran might fight more in Iraq.

The US has put a lot of pressure on Iran. They have done this with rules and money. But this has not helped. Things are worse between the US and Iraq.

The Prime Minister of Iraq is Adel Abdul-Mahdi. He is friends with both Iran and the US. He said he would keep the US people safe.

At first, the Iraqi police did not do much. But later, they came. They made a line. They stood between the protesters and the US guards.

Mike Pompeo is the US Secretary of State. He talked to Abdul-Mahdi on the phone. Pompeo said the US would protect its people.

The US embassy in Baghdad is very big. It is the biggest one in the world. Now, it is not clear if it can stay open. The protesters are outside. They have put up tents.

Many of the protesters came from funerals. The funerals were for soldiers who had died. They had flags. The flags were from Kata’ib Hezbollah. They were also from Hashd al-Shaabi. Hashd al-Shaabi is a strong group of soldiers. Kata’ib Hezbollah is part of this group."

On Monday, Iran condemned the US strikes as “terrorism”. Russia complained it had not been given advance warning. Street protests take place regularly in the Iraqi capital. In recent months, security guards have shot dead more than 450 people protesting against rampant government corruption and the growing influence of Iranian-backed groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah.","Qais al-Khazali was at the protest. He is the leader of Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq. This group has help from Iran. Many other leaders from these groups were also there.

Russia was not happy. They said nobody told them about the attacks before they happened.

People often protest in the streets of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.

In the last few months, many people have died in these protests. Security guards shot them. More than 450 people are dead. They were protesting against problems in the government. They were also angry about groups that Iran helps, like Kata’ib Hezbollah. These groups have too much power."

The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

**Earthquake Near Nuclear Plant in Iran**

There was an earthquake in Iran on Friday.
The earthquake was near the city of Bushehr.
Bushehr has a nuclear power plant.
The earthquake was a magnitude 5.1.
The US Geological Survey said this.
This earthquake was not very strong, but it could cause damage.

The center of the earthquake was 53 kilometers from Bushehr.
This is about 33 miles.
Bushehr is on the south coast of Iran, by the Persian Gulf.
The earthquake happened at 5:23 in the morning, local time.
This is 1:53 AM in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
The earthquake was not very deep, only 38 kilometers down.

After the earthquake, there were no reports of damage.
Iranian TV said this.
They said that they did not hear about any damage from the earthquake.
Earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 can cause damage.
The Bushehr nuclear plant was built to be strong.
It can handle bigger earthquakes.

Jahangir Dehqan works for the emergency department.
He told ISNA news that there was no damage reported.
The Red Crescent Society and other people checked the area.
They did not find any damage.

Iran has many fault lines.
Fault lines are cracks in the earth.
Earthquakes happen often in Iran.
In 2003, there was a big earthquake.
It was a magnitude 6.6.
The city of Bam was destroyed.
26,000 people died in that earthquake.
Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant.
But the nuclear plant was not damaged then.

In 2019, Iran said they would make more uranium.
This was more than they were allowed to make by an agreement in 2015.
The US left this agreement last year.
Donald Trump was the president then.
Iran says they need the uranium for peaceful reasons.
They say it is for their nuclear program for civil use."
3,3_0,0,"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said.","The Hungarian mangalica pig is a special animal. It has lived for almost 200 years. An emperor made this type of pig. Later, communists almost killed all of them.

This pig is big and heavy. It has a coat like a sheep. It is the pig with the most hair and fat. Many people think it is very delicious.

Thirty years ago, there were very few mangalica pigs. But now, they are back on farms and people like them again. They are also becoming popular around the world.

In places like the USA and Japan, people love this pig. Its fat makes it taste good. In Japan, they call it ""Kobe pork"". In Hungary, it is a national treasure.

But now, the mangalica pig has a new problem. A disease called African swine fever is spreading in Eastern Europe. This disease is killing many pigs.

More people liking the mangalica is also causing problems. Hungary is arguing with its neighbors.

A blogger in the USA said the mangalica was from Romania. This made people in Hungary angry. The blogger's video had almost one million views.

Hungary used to rule part of Romania. Now, some people in Hungary think Romania is trying to take away their culture. One news website said, ""They want to steal the mangalica from us.""

Péter Tóth is the president of the Mangalica Breeders Association. He said the situation could become like hummus between Lebanon and Israel. Hummus is a food that both countries say is from them.

Tóth said that all mangalica pigs in Romania came from Hungary recently. But he also said that the pig's story is international."
3,3_1,1,"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic.","Here's the text rewritten for CEFR B1 level:

A new type of pig started in the 1830s. The emperor in Vienna got some pigs from Serbia. These pigs were fat and had long hair.

The emperor had them mate with Hungarian pigs. This happened near a town called Arad. Arad is now in Romania.

A long time ago, many pigs in Hungary were this type. They were called mangalica pigs. About 90% of pigs in Hungary were mangalica.

These pigs had a lot of fat. People liked the fat because they could keep it for a long time. It lasted longer than meat.

Later, people started using electricity. They could keep food cold. So, they did not need as much pig fat. The mangalica pigs became more special and expensive.

After the war, things got bad for the mangalica pigs. The communist government almost made them disappear. Only 300 pigs were left. They kept them for science. You could not find the meat anywhere.

A young man named Tóth was studying to be a vet in Spain. He told his Spanish friend about the mangalica pigs. They decided to save them. This was in the 1990s.

Tóth put ads in the newspaper. He said, ""If you see a mangalica, please tell me!"" He bought all the mangalica pigs he could find.

He raised them with money from Spain. After some years, the pigs were ready. They sent the fat pork to Spain to make special food. This was in the late 1990s.

Now, there are many mangalica farmers in Hungary. There are more than 200. You can buy the meat in most markets. It costs more than normal pork. It costs about four times as much.

Zsóka Fekete has a mangalica farm. It is in eastern Hungary. She says the meat is very different.

She says the meat has lines of fat in it. This is especially true in the neck. She says it tastes special.

Zsóka used to work in a big company in Budapest. In 2012, she went back to her family farm. She bought 20 mangalica pigs. Now she has 300.

She sells her meat to many people. She sells to restaurants that are very good. She also sells to people in Budapest who love mangalica meat. People wait in line to buy her meat. She goes to Budapest every two weeks.

There is one problem for the mangalica pigs. It is a disease called African swine fever."
3,3_2,2,"The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”","Here's the rewritten text at a B1 level:

In Hungary, some wild pigs got sick last April. It was a disease. The disease is very easy to spread. No farm pigs have the disease yet. But if a dead, sick wild pig is found, all farm pigs near it must be killed. This is within 3 kilometers.

This disease is bad for a special pig called mangalica. These pigs live outside some of the time. So, new rules are made to protect them. Farms now have two fences. People cannot visit the farms now.

About 1,200 mangalica pigs have been killed in Hungary. This is more than 10% of all mangalica pigs.

Tóth said the government will help the mangalica pigs if things get worse. They will save the pig's genes. They will move some of the best mangalica pigs to safe places. These places could be zoos or schools.

Some people worry about meat and the weather. But in Hungary, people eat a lot of pork. Most people are not vegetarian. It might take a long time for this to change.

Tóth thinks people should eat less meat. He said the meat from big factories is not good. The animals suffer. He said people should eat less meat. But when they eat meat, it should be good meat. For example, eat mangalica once a week. He then ate some mangalica ham."

This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

People in India are protesting. They are protesting because the government changed the rules about who can be a citizen. This new law is called the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The protests are good to see. They show that Indian democracy is still strong. Even though some leaders in the government are not following the rules of the constitution, people are fighting for what they believe in.

The Indian constitution is very important. People talked about it and made it carefully over three years. These people were good at fighting for freedom. They took power from the British government. This was a very special time because it showed that the British were not fair to India.

A man named Henry Maine said that British India was a strange experiment. He said that free people were ruling a country like a king.

India became independent in 1947. There was a lot of fighting at that time. But India promised to be a fair country. It promised to be a country where everyone is equal. For 70 years, India tried to keep this promise.

Now, India has a problem with its constitution. This is because of a new law that was made too quickly. Some people think this law is not fair to everyone. It goes against what the people who made the constitution wanted for India. India is a big and diverse country, and its constitution is very important.

Vinita Damodaran, a professor, wrote about another topic. She talked about the police in Canada. The police were ready to shoot Native people.

She also said that England should take responsibility for what happened in Canada a long time ago. England took land from Native people in 1670. This land was called Rupert's Land. The Hudson Bay Company took things from this land.

England started many problems in Canada. England has gained a lot from taking things from Canada.

Vinita Damodaran said that the current government in Canada is still doing bad things. But she also said that it is important to remember that England started the problems in the first place."

5,5_0,0,"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family’s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian café, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again.","**Food and Restaurants**

Brexit has been bad for restaurants. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union.

The value of the British pound went down. This means things restaurants buy, like food, cost more.

Also, it was not clear if people from other European countries could stay in the UK. This made it hard for restaurants to find workers. Many workers are from Europe.

Now we know the UK will leave at the end of January. But things will probably not get better for restaurants in 2020.

Restaurant owners say it is very hard to keep workers who are not from the UK. These workers wonder if they can stay in the UK in the future.

The same problem exists in the food industry. Many workers in food factories are from Eastern Europe.

When it is hard to keep workers, companies pay them more. This means things cost more, and restaurants will need to raise prices. You can expect food prices to go up in restaurants and stores.

**Climate Change and Food**

Scientists are worried about the climate. They say we need to stop making more meat.

People are already eating less meat. For example, the shop Greggs sells a vegan sausage roll. Vegan means no meat or animal products.

Next year, more people will cook vegetarian and vegan food. More restaurants will offer food without meat.

**New Food Trends**

Food from Africa might become popular, especially in London.

A restaurant called Chuku's will open in London. It will serve food from Nigeria.

Also, a chef named William JM Chilila will open a restaurant. It will be called Akoko. The food will be inspired by West Africa.

**People to Watch**

Nisha Katona is a former lawyer. She decided to cook Indian food. She learned to cook from her family.

She has a restaurant called Mowgli. It serves Indian food. It started in Liverpool.

Now there are ten Mowgli restaurants. She will open four more in 2020. She also has plans for four more restaurants after that."
5,5_1,1,"Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.","Daniel Humm is a chef from America. He is one of many American chefs who want to be successful in Britain.

He has three stars from Michelin for his restaurant in New York. The restaurant is called Eleven Madison Park.

He just opened a new restaurant in London, at Claridge’s Hotel. The restaurant is called Davies and Brook. It is named after two streets near the hotel.

Before him, two other chefs had restaurants there. Their names were Simon Rogan and Gordon Ramsay. But their restaurants were not very successful. Humm hopes his new restaurant will do well.

Will Beckett and Huw Gott are also doing something new. They own a group of restaurants called Hawksmoor. These restaurants are good.

Now, they are opening a steakhouse in New York. New York is known for good steakhouses. It will be interesting to see if people in New York like their British steakhouse.

Next year, politicians will try to stop the climate crisis. The climate crisis is a big problem for the world.

In November, people will meet in Glasgow. This meeting is called UN COP26. They will talk about reducing carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are bad for the planet.

They want to agree on ways to keep the world from getting too hot. They want the temperature to rise less than 2 degrees Celsius.

Scientists say the world is already warmer than before. It is about 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer. If things don't change, it could be 3 or 4 degrees warmer by the end of the century.

If the world gets too hot, there will be problems. There will be strong storms and rising sea levels. Deserts will grow, and crops will fail. There will also be dangerous heat waves. These things will hurt people around the world.

In 2020, people will work to prepare for the meeting in Glasgow. They will try to get countries to agree to reduce carbon emissions. They also want to help poor countries and rich countries agree on how to fight the climate crisis.

Poor countries say that rich countries made most of the carbon emissions in the past. They say that rich countries are not doing enough to reduce emissions now.

Poor countries want rich countries to give them money. They want at least 100 billion dollars each year. This money will help them deal with the effects of global warming and reduce emissions.

So far, it has been hard to get everyone to agree."

Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters. There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020.

6,6_0,0,"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","Mark Carney is leaving his job as the head of the Bank of England. He said companies must explain why they still invest in oil, gas, and coal. He thinks these investments could become useless.

He spoke on a radio show called Today. He said that banks are starting to invest less in oil and gas. But he thinks this is not happening fast enough.

After he leaves his job, he will work for the United Nations. He will help with climate change and money. He talked on the radio show with Greta Thunberg. She is trying to make people care about climate change.

Mr. Carney thinks banks must do more to help the world use less carbon. He said climate change is a big problem coming soon. He said there will be more bad weather.

He said it will be too late if we wait until the weather is very bad. Leaders must start working on these problems now.

He was asked if people should stop investing in oil and gas companies. Mr. Carney said that people who manage money must explain their choices. They must explain why they invest in these companies.

He was also asked if pension funds should stop investing in oil and gas. Even if they make money, he thinks they need to explain why. He thinks these investments might become worthless.

He warned that we cannot burn all the oil and gas we have. If we do, we will not be able to stop climate change. He said that most coal and oil may become useless. He asked companies what their plan is. He asked banks, pension funds, and insurance companies too.

The Bank of England thinks a lot of money could be lost. This could happen if banks and companies do not change to using less carbon. They think about $20 trillion could become worthless very fast."
6,6_1,1,"In his interview, Carney urged climate change deniers to drop their opposition on the issue, saying: “We can’t afford on this one to have selective information, spin, misdirection.” One such sceptic is the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore, who guest-edited Today on Saturday and included in his programme a feature questioning the global consensus on the climate crisis. Complaining about how much internal opposition there had been to this item being included, Moore accused the BBC of “climate change alarmism”.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR B1 level:

Carney spoke in an interview. He said people who do not believe in climate change should stop. He said we need to stop arguing about climate change. We need to use correct information. We should not twist the facts or lie.

Charles Moore does not believe in climate change. He used to work for a newspaper. He was in charge of a BBC radio show called ""Today"" for one day. On his show, he asked if climate change was really a problem. He questioned if most people agree about the climate crisis.

Moore said it was hard to put this on the show. He said people at the BBC did not want him to talk about it. Moore said the BBC was too worried about climate change. He said the BBC was being ""alarmist."""
7,7_0,0,"A man who was shot dead in central Moscow after opening fire on the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s main intelligence agency building, in an attack that killed two has been identified as a gun enthusiast. Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.","A man shot someone in Moscow. The shooting happened at the office of the FSB. The FSB is the main secret agency of Russia. Two people died in the attack.

The man who shot people was Yevgeny Manyurov. He was 39 years old. He liked guns a lot. He was from a small town near Moscow.

On Thursday evening, Manyurov started shooting. He used a gun that shoots many bullets. He shot at the windows of the FSB building. One FSB worker died.

On Friday evening, another FSB officer died in the hospital. He was hurt in the shooting. Another FSB officer was badly hurt. Three other people were hurt too. One of them was not an officer.

The FSB shot and killed Manyurov. He had a bag with him. In the bag, officers found bombs.

The FSB said Manyurov did not get inside the building. The building used to be the office of the KGB. The KGB was the secret police in the past.

Russian news said Manyurov lived alone with his mother. They said he liked guns very much. He did not have a job. He used to work as a guard. He worked at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates.

Manyurov was in a shooting contest. He got third place. The contest was by a sports group. Vladimir Putin started the group again in 2009. He is the president of Russia.

Police found many guns at Manyurov's home. He owned them legally. He had rifles and shotguns. He used a Kalashnikov gun in the attack.

Oleg Solovich taught Manyurov how to shoot. He said Manyurov was not good at shooting. He said Manyurov wore a long coat when he came to shoot. Solovich told him to take off the coat, but Manyurov said he liked wearing it."
7,7_1,1,"The motive for the attack remains unclear, although Kommersant, a daily newspaper, reported that witnesses told investigators he was shouting slogans “typical of Islamic State”. “I noticed he had been somewhat agitated lately,” Baza, a media outlet with links to the security services, cited his mother as saying. She said he was unmarried, with no children or close friends, and that he was passionate about guns. He appears to have had no social media presence. The assault on the FSB office took place shortly after Putin’s annual press conference in Moscow. The president was attending a gala concert at the nearby Kremlin in honour of the security services during the shootout. The attack may have been planned to coincide with the speech, an FSB source told Reuters. Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process.","The reason for the attack is not known. But the newspaper Kommersant said people heard the attacker shouting. They said he shouted words like ""Islamic State.""

A news source called Baza talked to the attacker's mother. Baza is connected to the security people. The mother said he seemed worried recently. She said he was not married. He had no kids or good friends. She said he liked guns a lot. He did not use social media.

The attack was on an FSB office. The FSB is a security service. It happened soon after Putin gave a speech in Moscow. Putin was at a party for the security services. The party was in the Kremlin, near the shooting.

Someone from the FSB told Reuters that the attack might have been planned. Maybe the attacker wanted it to happen when Putin was giving his speech.

The news website Meduza said that the police kept shooting after the attacker was dead. They might have hurt someone who was walking by. The attacker's name was Manyurov."
8,8_0,0,"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries. A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration.","In Austria, the Green party might be in the government soon. This is the first time this could happen.

The Green party and the conservative party made a deal. The conservative party is led by Sebastian Kurz. He was the leader before, and he will probably be the leader again.

The Green party will be the smaller party in the government. They will work with Kurz's party, called the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP).

Before, the far-right Freedom party was with the ÖVP. But their leaders had to leave because of a problem called the ""Ibiza affair."" It was about money problems. People did not like this, so they voted for other parties.

Kurz's party and the Green party did well in the election. Kurz's party got the most votes, with 37%. The Green party got their best result ever.

The parties talked for a long time to make a deal. On Saturday, they agreed. Kurz said he thinks they can make a government together.

The leader of the Green party is Werner Kogler. He will probably be the second leader, called the deputy chancellor. He said they solved some big problems.

If the Green party members agree to the deal this Saturday, the president can start the new government. This could happen on January 7.

People in other countries are watching this. In Switzerland, the Green party did well in the elections. They want more power in the government.

In Germany, the Green party and Angela Merkel's party are popular. They will have elections in 2021.

A newspaper in Germany said that something is happening in Austria that people in Germany want. They said it is a new start with two good parties. These parties did well in the elections.

Kurz's party will have more power in the government because they won the election. They will probably be in charge of important jobs like leader, money, inside the country, other countries, and the army.

There will be a new job about helping people join the country. Kurz wants to keep his rules about people coming to Austria."
8,8_1,1,"It will be run by his confidante Susanne Raab, who worked on the country’s 2017 ban on full-face veils and a 2015 law designed to curb “political Islam”. The Green party will aim to exercise the most influence through a boosted ministry for infrastructure, transport and environment, expected to be headed by the former climate activist Leonore Gewessler. Green politicians in charge of the justice and culture portfolios will hope to curb the more authoritarian tendencies of Kurz’s ÖVP. In the final stretch of negotiations, Austria’s constitutional court ruled that some of the policies proposed by the conservatives – such as expanded surveillance measures or making social benefits conditional on command of the German language – would violate the constitution. “The Greens’ main aim [during coalition talks] has been to get major concessions on protecting the climate,” said Der Standard newspaper, commenting that the deal with the conservatives was as likely to please environmentalists as to frustrate leftwingers in the party. “With everything else, damage limitation will have to do.”","Susanne Raab will manage it. She is a close friend of him. She worked on laws before. One law stopped people from wearing full face veils in 2017. Another law in 2015 tried to stop ""political Islam.""

The Green party wants to have more power. They will use the ministry for roads, trains, and the environment. Leonore Gewessler will probably be in charge. She used to work to protect the climate.

Green politicians will be in charge of justice and culture. They want to stop the ÖVP party from being too strict.

Before the deal was made, something important happened. The court said some of the ÖVP party's ideas were not legal. These ideas were about watching people more. They also wanted people to speak German to get money from the government. The court said this was against the rules.

A newspaper called Der Standard wrote about the deal. They said the Green party wants to protect the climate most of all. The deal with the ÖVP party might make some people happy. But it might also make some people in the Green party sad. The newspaper said that the Green party will try to stop bad things from happening. They will do their best."
9,9_0,0,"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes. CGT union workers also voted to halt production at Total’s Grandpuits refinery.","French train workers are on strike. They do not like the new rules about pensions. They had a protest in Paris.

The police and the workers had a fight. This happened after Emmanuel Macron asked them to stop for Christmas.

Many workers and union members met on Monday. They were outside the Gare de Lyon train station. This station is used by people going south for the holidays. Some people are going to ski in the Alps. Many trains have been stopped.

Some workers spoke to the crowd. They said they do not like the government's pension plan. They said they will keep striking during Christmas and the new year.

The protesters used flares and fireworks. Smoke went into the train station. Police with helmets and shields stood near the ticket area.

The train strikes have lasted 19 days. The train company, SNCF, said the strikes are causing big problems.

Most workers and unions did not listen to the president. He asked them to stop for Christmas. People waited in line to buy tickets for the few trains that were running.

Some trains stopped early. Some trains were replaced with buses. About half of the people with train tickets could not travel on December 23 and 24. They had to find other ways to travel. Some used car-sharing or rented cars.

The Paris subway and trains near Paris also had problems. Many people gathered at the Gare du Nord train station. They were waiting for trains to the suburbs. There were not many trains.

Some people wanted to go to the airport. They said it was hard to find taxis. Some taxi drivers charged more money than usual. The traffic around Paris was very bad.

Some people are worried about going home after Christmas. The strikes will continue in January.

Also, workers stopped production at an oil refinery in southern France. The refinery is called Lavera. It processes a lot of oil. The workers are from the CGT union. They stopped working to protest the pension changes. CGT union workers also stopped work at Total's Grandpuits refinery."
9,9_1,1,"Emmanuel Lepine, the secretary general of the CGT’s oil branch, told France Info radio that CGT workers at other refineries in France could also vote to halt production. “We gave an ultimatum to the government, it didn’t listen, so we’re doing exactly what we promised,” Lepine said. “What we are demanding is the withdrawal of the reform.” State officials have begun preparing for another round of union negotiations in the coming weeks before a further national day of protests on 9 January. The government has insisted it will push ahead with attempts to unify the French pension system, arguing that removing 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Opéra de Paris staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any age-related changes. Unions are angry at government plans to introduce a “pivot age” – keeping the legal retirement age at 62 but insisting on an additional two years of work to receive a full pension.","Here's the rewritten text at a B1 CEFR level:

Emmanuel Lepine works for the CGT. He is in charge of oil workers. He spoke to France Info radio. He said workers at other oil places in France might stop working. They will vote about it.

Lepine said they told the government what they wanted. The government did not listen. So, they are doing what they said they would do. They want the government to stop the new plan.

The government is getting ready to talk to the unions again. This will happen in the next few weeks. There will be another big protest on January 9th.

The government wants to change the pension system. The pension system is how people get money when they stop working. The government wants to make one system for everyone. Now, there are 42 different systems. Some are for train workers, energy workers, lawyers, and people who work at the Opéra de Paris.

The government says it needs to change the system. They say it will help the system have enough money. More people are getting old.

Some unions like the idea of one system. But almost all unions do not want changes to when people can retire.

The government wants to keep the retirement age at 62. But they also want people to work two more years to get all their pension money. The unions are angry about this plan. They do not like the idea of working longer."

From a cocktail-making contest to a MasterChef-inspired cook-off, the Guardian spoke to four people about their plans for New Year’s Eve. ‘I think he’s making a daiquiri but he’s not very good’ “I’ll be making a raspberry mojito,” said Elinor, speaking of the cocktail-making contest she and her partner, Richard, both 32, have planned for Thursday night. “I think he’s making a daiquiri, but he’s not very good,” she added. Elinor, who works as an engineer in Glasgow, said the idea came to them as they drew suggestions from a hat. Both of them will also be attending an organised online murder mystery event. “We’ve done one before and they work quite well – you go into Zoom rooms to be questioned then come back together and watch the scenes play out,” she said. “In Scotland we have a tradition to ‘first foot’, which means being someone’s first visitor after midnight – normally bearing gifts such as shortbread and whisky. You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick. It’s horrifying at the moment.” ‘We’ve got to be optimistic’ In Preston, Janet and her husband, now both retired, have got together with neighbours every year for the last 18 years for a Christmas party. Coronavirus has prevented them celebrating this year but they are determined to see in 2021 together. In their cul-de-sac, people from five houses are planning to take fire pits and patios – and their drink of choice – to their front gardens at 11.30pm for a safe, socially distanced party.","It is almost 2021.

Elinor and her partner Richard are both 32. They will have a contest. They will make cocktails.

Elinor said she will make a raspberry mojito. Richard will make a daiquiri. Elinor said Richard is not very good at making daiquiris.

Elinor works as an engineer in Glasgow. She said they got the idea from a game. They picked ideas from a hat.

They will also play a game online. It is a murder mystery. They played it before. They liked it.

You go into rooms on Zoom. People ask you questions. Then everyone watches a scene.

In Scotland, there is a tradition called ""first foot."" This means being the first visitor to someone's house after midnight. The visitor brings gifts like shortbread and whisky.

You should not leave your house until you get your first visitor. But Elinor is worried. Because of Covid, she doesn't know how people will do this tradition.

Elinor and Richard were sick for the last two years. They had norovirus. So this year is better.

Usually, they have drinks at a friend's house. But they hope to stop people from getting sick. It is very bad right now.

Janet and her husband live in Preston. They are retired. For 18 years, they had a Christmas party with their neighbors.

This year, they cannot have a Christmas party because of coronavirus. But they want to celebrate 2021 together.

However, she believes it’s important to celebrate what you can. “I just hope everyone else can have a good time in a small way. It’s making the best of what you’ve got and who you’ve got around you.

It’s been a bit disappointing since I arrived in the UK as you always hear that London has a lot of cultural things to offer, but I’ve not been able to experience that yet. I hope next year I’ll be able to see more of the city and that people will be nicer to each other and less toxic. We need to appreciate what we have.” ‘On balance he may be a better cook than me’ Helen, 29, who works in marketing in London said she was “really gunning to win” the MasterChef cook-off she has been preparing for against her boyfriend, Rory, 26. “We’ve been watching the show a lot and started to enjoy cooking more due to lockdown,” she said.","Janet said, ""We can toast each other.

11,11_0,0,"In Sydney the fireworks soared into the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour below was empty. In New York, Times Square was mostly deserted. No light show illuminated Beijing from the top of the TV tower. With revelry around the world curtailed by lockdowns and curfews imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19, the lions of London’s Trafalgar Square were barricaded off, and there were no crowds in St Peter’s Square and no one diving into the Tiber in Rome. This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget – one that has seen more than 1.7 million people killed and 82 million infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, whose pyrotechnic display has in the past drawn crowds of a million people to the city’s harbour area, rang in 2021 with a shortened display, with most popular observation spots fenced off and a heavy police presence deterring visitors. Only people who had restaurant reservations or were one of five guests of an inner-city resident were allowed in. “What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands gathered at popular spots across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but were not particularly worried. In New Zealand, too, which has managed to eliminate coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year’s Eve plans proceeded as usual. In Germany, however, where the sale of fireworks has been banned to discourage crowds and authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”, Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final new year’s address as chancellor that she had never found the old year so heavy.","In Sydney, fireworks went up in the sky. They were above the Opera House. But the harbour under the Opera House was empty.

In New York, Times Square was almost empty too. In Beijing, there were no lights on the TV tower.

People all over the world could not celebrate like normal. This was because of rules to stop Covid-19. London's Trafalgar Square had fences around the lion statues. There were no crowds in St Peter’s Square in Rome. No one jumped into the Tiber river.

This New Year's Eve was different. Many people said goodbye to a bad year. In that year, more than 1.7 million people died. 82 million people got sick from the coronavirus since January.

Sydney usually has big fireworks shows. A million people come to the harbour to watch. This year, the show was shorter. Many places to watch were blocked. Police were there to stop people from coming. Only people with restaurant bookings could come. Also, people who were visiting someone who lived in the city could come. They could only bring five guests.

Gladys Berejiklian is the leader of New South Wales. She said it was a very hard year. She hopes 2021 will be better.

The coronavirus started in Wuhan, China. Thousands of people met in the city center to celebrate. They were careful, but not too worried.

New Zealand stopped the coronavirus after a long lockdown. People celebrated New Year's Eve like normal there.

In Germany, people could not buy fireworks. This was to stop crowds. Police in Berlin said they would punish people who broke the rules. Angela Merkel is the leader of Germany. She said that she felt the last year was very hard. It was her last New Year's speech as leader."
11,11_1,1,"“And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope,” said Merkel, a trained physicist who won praise for taming the first virus wave but has drawn criticism for soaring infection and death numbers in the second. She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve.","Merkel spoke about the new year. She said we have worries and some doubts. But we also have much hope for the new year. Merkel used to be a physicist. People liked how she handled the virus at first. But now, many are sick and dying. Some people do not agree with the rules about the virus. They protest and believe in wrong ideas about vaccines. Merkel said this is hard for people who lost loved ones. It is also hard for people who are sick. She said it is sad when people deny the virus is real.

The health minister, Jens Spahn, thinks this New Year's Eve will be very quiet.

In France, only six adults can meet for dinner. 100,000 police officers will stop people from celebrating in public. They will not let people sell alcohol in some places. The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, told police to make sure everyone follows the curfew. The curfew is from 8 pm to 6 am. This is to stop people from gathering and causing trouble.

In Britain, many people died on Thursday. This is because of a new type of the virus. People who want to celebrate New Year's Eve were told to wait. They should celebrate later in the year. The rule is ""Covid loves a crowd"".

Professor Stephen Powis works for the NHS in England. He said to stay home for New Year's Eve. He said to follow the rules. This will stop the virus from spreading. It will also help hospitals. He said it is very important to stay home and not meet other people.

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also said to follow the rules. He said to stay safe at home for the new year.

They put up barriers in public places in London. This includes Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square.

Italy has the most deaths from the virus in Europe. In Italy, bars, restaurants, and most shops are closed. There is a curfew from 10 am to 7 pm on New Year's Eve."
11,11_2,2,"Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility. In New York, the New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway but in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said.","Pope Francis could not lead the New Year's services. He has a problem with his leg called sciatica. The Vatican said this.

Vladimir Putin is the leader of Russia. He gave a New Year's speech. He said he hopes the Russian people will work together. They are fighting a virus. He knows that many people are getting sick again.

Putin said the virus is still a problem. He said the fight against the virus is not stopping. Many doctors and nurses will work on New Year's Eve. He asked people to be careful.

In New York, they will drop a ball on New Year's Eve. Usually, many people watch in Times Square. This year, not many people will be there.

Some nurses and doctors will watch. They will be with their families. They will stand far apart from each other. This is to stop the virus from spreading.

The police closed Times Square to cars and people. This is because of the virus. If people try to watch, the police will ask them to leave.

The police chief said people cannot stand and watch the ball. They need to stay away."
12,12_0,0,"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","This year has been hard for many people. It has also been hard for the elephants at Elefanjoy. Elefanjoy is a place in Jaipur, India, where elephants live.

In March, a sickness came. The country closed down. The elephants at Elefanjoy could not walk every day. They used to walk 30 miles each day. This walk helped them move their legs and eat food well.

Now, the elephants started to get sick. They also felt sad. The people at Elefanjoy also felt sad.

Ankit Pareek takes care of Elefanjoy. He said the elephants felt that the people were worried. The elephants were sad because tourists did not come. Tourists used to walk with them, wash them, and play with them. They also took photos with the elephants. The people at Elefanjoy were very worried about the elephants.

Ankit had another big worry. He needed money from tourists to take care of the elephants. Elephants eat a lot. They eat about 200 kg of food each day. It costs 5,000 rupees (£51) for each elephant every day.

Ankit said he did not want the elephants to be hungry. He thinks they should have love and respect. So, he borrowed money to buy food for them. Ankit has been with elephants since he was a child. He said if tourists do not come back soon, it will be bad.

Some people who help animals say that training elephants for tourists is not good. It can be cruel. In India and Thailand, many tourists like to see elephants. But now, there are no tourists. This is a problem for the elephants.

Some people hope this will stop the bad treatment of elephants for tourism. In September, four elephants died. They used to carry tourists. They stayed tied up all day for many months. They did not have enough food or water. This made them very sick and they died.

Varda Mehrotra works for an animal protection group. She said that they have been watching how the elephants are treated badly for many years."
12,12_1,1,"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","COVID-19 has made problems worse. These are problems we knew about for a long time. Now, elephants are dying because of them.

One big problem is that India only has a few places for elephants to live safely. These places are called elephant sanctuaries. There are only about eight. Most of them cannot take more elephants. Many elephants are now without work and hungry.

In India, some people own elephants. These elephants used to make money. They were in Hindu festivals called pujas. They were also in wedding parades. But now these events are stopped because of COVID-19. So the elephants cannot work.

The governments in Kerala and Rajasthan gave money to the elephant owners. This was during the lockdown. But now, they don't give money anymore. Other states did not give any money at all.

Hareshbabu Rengan is 37 years old. He lives in Tamil Nadu. His family owns two elephants. They are 40 years old. Their names are Lakshmi and Kusma. He is using the internet to ask for money. He wants to help his elephants and other elephants that need help.

He said he is worried about all the elephants in India. People who own elephants are having problems. They need money to care for the elephants. But they are afraid to ask for help because they do not want to be treated badly.

In Thailand, many elephants lived in tourist camps. There were about 2,000 elephants. Now, people are leaving these elephants.

The government in Thailand helped a little. They gave grass and hay to feed the elephants. But some camps had to close.

Then, many elephants started walking across Thailand. About 1,000 elephants walked back to their owners' villages. The owners are called mahouts. These villages were where the elephants were born. The elephants had not seen these places for many years.

In March, three elephants came to a special park. The park is called Elephant Nature Park. It is in Chiang Mai. The elephants' names are Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah.

The person who took care of them asked if they could stay at the park for a short time. The next morning, he was gone. He called later and said he could not take care of the elephants anymore. He did not have enough money.

Sangdeaun Chailert runs the Elephant Nature Park. She said people leave dogs and cats at animal clinics sometimes. Now, people are leaving elephants with her."
12,12_2,2,"Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, the president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said the number of callers asking for veterinary assistance had grown since March. Patitta Traiwet, the president of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has branches across Thailand, said she had managed to maintain the animals’ routine but the elephants had noticed the absence of tourists lining up to give them bananas and pineapples. “They were confused at the beginning – where are the people? Why is nobody feeding me banana?” she said. Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth. Many people now hope that even when the tourists return, these elephants will remain resettled in their natural habitat for good. Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol","She has a place with 97 elephants. Most of them are old. They don't work anymore. They used to give rides to people. She saved them from those jobs.

There is a big problem now. Elephants in Thailand cost less money. Sangdeaun said that before, a baby elephant cost $100,000. Now, it costs only $40,000.

She is worried. Families have taken care of elephants for a long time. She thinks they might sell the elephants to big companies. The companies will pay less money.

Elephants in camps in Thailand are often in chains. They stay in chains for a long time. Sangdeaun said they are sad. They get angry and fight with each other.

Some camps have fewer people working there. So, the elephants are not getting the care they need.

Theerapat Trungprakan helps elephants. He said more people are asking for help from the elephant doctors. This has been happening since March.

Patitta Traiwet runs a place for elephants. It is in many places in Thailand. She is still taking care of the elephants the same way. But the elephants know that tourists are not there. Tourists used to give them bananas and pineapples. The elephants are confused. They ask, ""Where are the people? Why aren't they giving me bananas?""

But some elephants went back home with their keepers. They can now play in the jungle and rivers. This is where they were born. The coronavirus problem may have helped them.

Many people hope the elephants can stay in the jungle. They hope this even when the tourists come back. They want the elephants to live in their natural home.

13,13_0,0,"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

There is a new type of Covid-19 virus in the UK. It spreads fast. Scientists think this type spreads more easily.

They think this because they found more virus in people who had this new type. This new type is called B117.

Scientists found B117 when they looked at why cases went up in Kent. This happened even when people were staying home in November. The old types of the virus were going down, but B117 kept spreading.

Some labs started to see B117 in samples. These labs were made to test more people for Covid-19. Then, a group of scientists warned about B117 and how fast it spreads.

Dr. Michael Kidd and his team looked at 641 samples. These samples were from people who felt sick. They found B117 and other types of the virus.

About 35% of people with B117 had a lot of virus in their samples. Only 10% of people without B117 had a lot of virus. This study has not been checked by other scientists yet.

Dr. Kidd said that people with B117 seem to have more virus. He said it might be easier for them to give the virus to other people. But he also said we need more information.

Scientists are quite sure that B117 spreads more easily. A study said it might spread 56% faster than the old types.

We don't know exactly why it spreads faster. Maybe it takes fewer virus particles to make someone sick.

Maybe the virus grows faster in people's bodies. Or maybe people with B117 are sick for a longer time. This could also make them spread the virus more.

Dr. Kidd said they need to find out why people with B117 have so much virus in their bodies. They need to do more tests to understand why this new type spreads so fast."
13,13_1,1,"“Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death. But a higher rate of transmissibility without strict controls could still lead to more death. • This article was corrected on 30 December 2020. The higher viral load was found in respiratory samples, not blood samples as an earlier version stated.","We need more information, like pieces of a puzzle. This study is important. But it is just the first step. We need to do it again.

This study helps us understand why the virus spreads easily. People with the virus might be more likely to give it to others.

Early information says the UK virus type does not make people more sick. It also does not seem to cause people to get the virus again. It does not seem to cause more deaths.

But this virus type spreads more easily. If we are not careful, more people could die.

This article was changed on December 30, 2020. The virus was found in the nose and throat, not in blood. We said it was in blood before, but that was wrong."
14,14_0,0,"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Hospitals may have to make very hard choices soon. Doctors are worried about this. They think hospitals might not be able to help all the people with COVID-19.

The hospitals in the UK are very busy. Too many people are sick. Doctors think they might have to choose which patients get important treatment. This could mean some people do not get the help they need to live.

People are asking for a new lockdown in the UK. A lockdown means everyone stays home. People also want schools to open later after Christmas. They want schools to open one month later. This can help stop the virus from spreading so fast.

Hospitals have many people with COVID-19. Some people might not get a bed in the intensive care unit. Some people might not get a machine to help them breathe. This is because the hospitals are too full.

The government might make the rules about COVID-19 stronger. Matt Hancock will talk about this. He will tell people if the rules are working. The rules are called tiers.

England might get a new tier called tier 5. Tier 5 would be stronger than tier 4. London and other places are already in tier 4. The government wants to stop the virus from spreading quickly. Many people are getting sick. On Tuesday, a lot of people got sick - 53,135 people. Scotland already has five tiers.

More and more hospitals are getting full. They have many very sick people. In London, some hospitals are very full. Doctors asked to move some patients to another place. They moved them far away to Yorkshire. This is because the hospitals in London need more beds.

One hospital in London is making changes. It is moving the children's area to another hospital. This will make more space for adults. The adults have COVID-19 and other illnesses. Another hospital will also make more space for people with COVID-19."
14,14_1,1,"A senior manager at the trust, which now has 424 inpatients with Covid, said: “London Gold call has indicated that this position is expected to escalate for the next two weeks with 4 January potentially the zenith of critical care capacity needed.” The Independent Sage committee of scientific and medical experts is urging ministers to instigate an immediate further UK-wide lockdown to try to prevent an imminent “catastrophe”. Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action. Referring to the Tiers review, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: “It will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people to the highest level.” A toughening is needed urgently because pressures on the NHS in some places is “rising at an unsustainable rate”, she said. Keir Starmer sounded a stark warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian that the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January. Dr Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS and president of the HCSA, said ICU staff may end up having to in effect ration who received care that could help them survive. “Our NHS just doesn’t have the beds to cope. Some areas will be overwhelmed in days. If ventilation capacity is exceeded, horrendous choices will have to be made over those who live and die.","A manager at the hospital said something important. The hospital has 424 patients with Covid now. The manager said things will get worse in the next two weeks. They think January 4th will be the worst day for the hospital. They may not have enough beds for very sick people.

A group of experts called Independent Sage wants the government to act now. They want a new lockdown in the UK. This will help stop a big problem. If they wait, many people will die. These people could be saved if they act now.

Sir David King leads the group. He used to be a scientist for the government. The group also thinks schools should stay closed. They should stay closed until February. Opening them next week could make things worse. There is a new type of the virus. It spreads faster. It seems to infect young people more easily.

Christina Pagel is a member of Independent Sage. She said things are very bad now. She said they will get even worse. We need to act now. If we do not, the NHS could fail in a few weeks. It is very serious.

NHS Providers also wants the government to do more. This group speaks for hospitals in England. Saffron Cordery works for NHS Providers. She said the government needs to make hard choices. They need to put more people in the highest level of rules. We need to make the rules stronger now. The hospitals are getting too many patients very quickly.

Keir Starmer is a leader in the Labour party. He said the NHS and schools are in trouble. This will last for the next month. He said the UK might have a third lockdown in January.

Dr. Claudia Paoloni works in a hospital. She is a doctor who gives people medicine to sleep. She said the doctors in the ICU might have to choose who gets help to live. The NHS does not have enough beds. Some places will have too many patients soon. If they do not have enough machines to help people breathe, they will have to make very hard choices. They will have to choose who lives and who dies."
14,14_2,2,"“The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days.","Here's a rewritten version of the text at a CEFR B1 level:

The doctors will have to make hard choices. For example, they must decide which patients can go to intensive care. Some patients might only get limited care. This means they cannot go to intensive care.

Doctors must also decide how long to treat a patient who is not getting better. If another patient needs a special machine (haemodialysis), and there are not enough machines, they must choose. They also need to choose who gets a bed with a breathing machine (ventilator) if all the beds are full.

Paoloni said that hospitals might have to stop some normal care. This includes cancer surgery. NHS England said they would try to keep this treatment going, but it might not be possible.

A hospital might ask: ""Can we do cancer surgery today? We have few beds. If we use the last bed for cancer surgery, we might not have space for emergencies.""

Checking people for diseases like cancer might also stop. People might wait longer for an ambulance when they call 999.

The NHS is facing a very big problem. It is the biggest problem in 72 years. Some hospitals are thinking about putting up tents outside. They will use these tents to check patients.

There are long lines of ambulances outside many hospitals. The ambulances have patients inside. Some patients wait for hours in the ambulances to get into the hospital.

On Tuesday, ambulances were waiting outside some hospitals. These hospitals include the Royal London Hospital, Queen's Hospital, and Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

Dr. Simon Walsh said that hospitals might use tents. He said this is what they usually do after a big accident, like a bomb attack.

NHS staff are getting ready for more people to come to the hospital with Covid. The number of people with Covid is still going up. Dr. Walsh wants the government to make a plan to help the NHS.

The Doctors' Association UK said that Covid has made things much worse for the NHS. The NHS is under a lot of pressure."

The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango.","During the pandemic, technology helped us a lot. It helped us keep our jobs and feel better. But in Barcelona, something else happened. The lockdowns made people like books again. Books are a very old and simple invention.

Bookshops in Barcelona are selling more books now. Some new bookshops have even opened. One of these is called Llibreria Byron. It was started by a small company that makes books for schools. It opened in November in Sant Antoni.

Mariana Sarrias owns the shop with someone else. She said they planned to open in April. But they could not because of the pandemic. They were worried because they had put a lot of money into the shop.

They named the shop Byron after a writer. He was a romantic person. He also did things that were different from others.

The day they opened in November, many people were waiting. There was not enough space for everyone. It made Mariana feel very emotional. People come to the shop every day now. She does not know why. Maybe they want to help the shop. Or maybe the area needed a bookshop.

Maria Carme Ferrer is the head of the booksellers' group in Catalonia. She said the pandemic made people want to help local bookshops. Bookshops are like cultural centers for the area.

Mariana said that her company saw more orders for books during the lockdown. Maybe people were bored of watching TV. Or maybe they felt lonely and books helped them.

Not long ago, bookshops were not doing well. In 2013, a famous bookshop called Catalonia closed. It was a popular place for readers since 1924. Now, a McDonald's restaurant is there.

In the same year, another bookshop called Canuda closed. It was a big bookshop with many old books. It inspired a book called ""The Shadow of the Wind."" Now, a clothing store called Mango is there."
15,15_1,1,"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","Maybe this quick return to reading is normal. This city is the main place for book selling in Spain. The people of Catalonia love books. They celebrate this love every year on April 23rd. This is the birthday of their special saint, Sant Jordi (Saint George). It is also Shakespeare’s birthday!

On this day, people give books and roses to each other. The streets are full of small book shops. This year, the celebration of Sant Jordi did not happen because of the sickness. Lluís Morral works at Laie. Laie is a popular bookshop in the city. He thinks the celebration will be small in 2021.

Morral says that book sales have gone up during the time when people stayed home. People are buying older, famous books more than new books. He said that many people are reading again. They are not looking for new books. They want to read books they wanted to read before.

He said that many people buy books on Sant Jordi but do not read them. Now, they see the books at home and start reading. He thinks that being alone has helped people find out that books are good friends.

Morral said that many people he knows got tired of watching TV. Laie and Byron are bookshops with cafes. They have quiet places to read. This is good because this city is the loudest city in Europe.

Two new shops are opening. One is called Ona. It only sells books in the Catalan language. The other is called Finestres. It will open soon. Both want to be places where people can meet, read, and buy books. Some people who like to help others gave money to start these shops. Morral hopes they do well.

But he knows it will be hard for them to sell books. They are small shops. They have to compete with Amazon. Amazon is a very big company. Morral said that small bookshops can help people more. They can understand what books you like. They can suggest books you might enjoy. Amazon uses a computer program to suggest books."
16,16_0,0,"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said.","The government of France is getting some criticism. Some people think the government is trying to please people who do not want vaccines.

The country started giving vaccines a few days ago. But not many people have gotten the vaccine yet.

Health workers in France said that this is a long process, not a quick one. They are going slowly because many people in France are not sure about the vaccine.

A survey said that only about 40% of people in France want to get the vaccine. This number was higher in October. Then, more than half of the people in France said they wanted the vaccine.

In Britain, 77% of people want the vaccine. In the United States, 69% of people want it.

France started giving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday. They started with people who work and live in care homes. They also started with people who might get very sick from the virus.

France is the only country that asks people to write down that they agree to get the vaccine. They ask this after telling them about possible problems.

But in the first three days, not many people got the vaccine. Fewer than 100 people got vaccinated.

By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had gotten the vaccine. This is according to people in the health ministry.

The health ministry wants to give the vaccine to 1 million old and at-risk people in January. This means they need to give more than 31,200 vaccines every day.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, said that France is giving vaccines slower than other countries. He said this is on purpose. He wants to give people information about the vaccine. He said it is not because they do not have enough vaccines or because there is a problem with getting the vaccines to people.

Véran said that France has the same amount of vaccines as Germany. He said they have the same goals and will get the same results.

Véran said that it is taking some time to start. He said he wants to be careful and not rush.

The president, Emmanuel Macron, and his ministers said that the vaccine is not required. Government people said that they will not make a list of people who do not want to get the vaccine.

But Macron said that people should listen to science and think clearly.

He said that the vaccine is not required. He said that people should trust the scientists and doctors."
16,16_1,1,"In his new year address on Thursday, Macron vowed to avoid “unjustifiable delays” to vaccinations but also struck a defensive note, saying he would let “no one play with the safety” of the campaign. Axel Kahn, a leading geneticist and head of the National League Against Cancer, told Europe 1 radio that France’s vaccine strategy was wrong. “It is not suited to a situation that is so dangerous,” he said. Philippe Juvin, head of the casualty ward at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. “As an individual, I would like to be vaccinated to set an example and show people that we don’t die from the vaccine, we die from Covid. And when we don’t die, we can get severe forms of it that are very disabling,” Juvin told CNews television. Opposition leaders said the slowness of the vaccination programme made France the “dunce” of Europe. Damien Abad, leader of the centre-right opposition Les Républicains in the Assemblée Nationale, demanded an urgent meeting with the health minister. In a letter, other opposition critics wrote: “Mass vaccination is the ultimate means of seeing our country emerge from the damaging economic situation caused by the health crisis. Yet France is vaccinating 10,000 times slower than the UK.” They added: “France cannot be one of the last countries to get vaccinated and yet that’s the picture we’re facing today.” Alain Fischer, the government official overseeing France’s vaccination programme, told Europe 1 the country had chosen to prioritise the elderly and vulnerable, as opposed to health professionals, as in other countries. “There is no good or bad choice … These are small details that will seem ridiculous in two or three months,” he said. Critics say this hesitation is feeding conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxer sentiment. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, said the scientific data was clear. “The vaccine is safe and efficient. Like many of my colleagues, I think we should be giving the vaccines quicker in order to control the epidemic more rapidly. At the rate we’re going, we’ll still be in lockdown in 2022,” he tweeted.","On Thursday, President Macron talked about vaccinations for the new year. He said he wants to avoid delays. But he also said safety is very important. He will not let anyone risk safety during the vaccination program.

Axel Kahn is a doctor who studies genes. He is also the head of a cancer organization. He said France's vaccine plan is not good. He said it is not right for a dangerous situation.

Philippe Juvin is a doctor at a hospital in Paris. He agrees with Axel Kahn. He wants to get the vaccine himself. He wants to show people it is safe. He said people die from Covid, not from the vaccine. He also said Covid can make people very sick.

Other leaders in France are not happy with the vaccine program. They said France is the slowest country in Europe to give vaccines. Damien Abad is a leader in the government. He wants to meet with the health minister now.

Other leaders wrote a letter. They said vaccines are important for the country to get better. They said France is giving vaccines much slower than the UK. They said France cannot be one of the last countries to give vaccines.

Alain Fischer is in charge of the vaccine program. He said France is giving vaccines to old and sick people first. Other countries are giving vaccines to doctors and nurses first. He said there is no right or wrong way to do it. He thinks people will forget about this in a few months.

Some people think the slow vaccine program is bad. They think it makes people believe in wrong ideas about vaccines.

Nathan Peiffer-Smadja is a doctor who studies infections. He said the vaccine is safe and it works well. He thinks France should give vaccines faster. He said if they don't, France will still be in lockdown in 2022."

17,17_0,0,"Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","Officials in Gibraltar check on the monkeys every day. They are worried that the monkeys could get the coronavirus.

The monkeys in Gibraltar are called Barbary macaques. They are very important to Gibraltar.

Gibraltar is a British area. Not many people there have had the virus. About 1,500 people got sick and six people died.

Governments all over the world are trying to stop the virus. The people in Gibraltar have another problem. They need to protect the monkeys from the virus. These monkeys are the only wild monkeys in Europe.

Mark Pizarro is a vet. He takes care of the monkeys. He said they knew from the beginning that the monkeys could get the virus. He said the virus lives in people, and people are like primates. So, other primates like monkeys could get the virus too.

This year, the government made new rules. They wanted people to stay away from the monkeys. The monkeys are a big tourist attraction.

In August, a new law was made. It said you cannot touch or bother the monkeys. It is also against the law to feed the monkeys. People who feed the monkeys have to pay a lot of money.

The government said that monkeys can easily get sick from people. For example, monkeys have had hepatitis A before.

People think the monkeys have lived on the Rock since a long time ago. There is an old story. It says that as long as the monkeys are in Gibraltar, the British will control the area.

Sometimes, people have tried hard to protect the monkeys. During the war, Winston Churchill ordered more monkeys to come from Africa. He wanted to make sure there were enough monkeys.

Now, there are about 220 monkeys.

Recently, they tested four monkeys for the coronavirus. These monkeys died for other reasons, like being hit by cars. The tests were negative. This made the government think the virus is not a big problem for the monkeys.

But, in November, people became worried again. Denmark said they would kill many mink. They were worried that the mink had a new kind of virus. This new virus could stop the vaccines from working."
17,17_1,1,"The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal. They interact with themselves, they forage naturally, they spend more time grooming each other, there’s less aggression between the macaques,” said Pizarro. “So there is a lot of positive spin from decreased human contact.”","The government of Gibraltar is worried about what Denmark said. Denmark said that monkeys might get the virus. If the monkeys get sick, they could give the virus to people. The virus could change in the monkeys. This could make the vaccine not work well.

Pizarro said his team is watching the monkeys every day. There are six people on his team. They have not seen many sick monkeys yet.

The team has seen that the monkeys are doing better now. There are fewer tourists because of the virus. The monkeys are acting more normal.

They play with each other more. They find food in nature more often. They clean each other more. The monkeys are not fighting as much. Pizarro said that it is good that people are not near the monkeys as much."
18,18_0,0,"Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy analyst who served three decades in prison for leaking thousands of classified documents to Israel, has arrived in Tel Aviv after being released from parole. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”. The couple are expected to enter several days of quarantine, which is compulsory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of coronavirus.","Jonathan Pollard used to work for the US Navy. He gave secret papers to Israel. He went to prison for 30 years. Now, he is in Tel Aviv.

He was let out of prison. Then, he had to stay home for some time. This is called parole. Now, his parole is finished.

Benjamin Netanyahu is the leader of Israel. He met Pollard and his wife, Esther. They got off a plane. The leader's office showed this on video.

Pollard and his wife are Jewish. They kissed the ground. Then, they said hello to Netanyahu.

Pollard said they were very happy to be home. It took 35 years. He was born in the US. But he got Israeli citizenship while he was in prison. He said he was proud of Israel and its leader.

Netanyahu said a prayer. It was a prayer to thank God for letting prisoners go free. Then, Netanyahu gave Pollard an Israeli ID card. He said, ""Welcome home.""

In 1985, the FBI arrested Pollard. He tried to hide in the Israeli embassy in Washington. But he could not. In 1987, he was sent to prison for life.

This made things hard between the US and Israel. They are usually good friends. Pollard being in prison for so long made things worse. Netanyahu has wanted Pollard to be free for many years.

In the 1990s, Pollard got Israeli citizenship. Netanyahu was leader then too. He tried to get US leaders to let Pollard go free. But it did not work.

Pollard was let out of parole last month. The old US government helped Netanyahu.

Netanyahu called Pollard last month. He asked when Pollard would come to Israel. He said they were waiting for him.

Pollard's lawyer is Eliot Lauer. He said it was a dream come true after 35 hard years.

Pollard and his wife will stay home for a few days. This is because of the coronavirus. Everyone who comes to Israel must do this."
19,19_0,0,"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that it would be glad to meet the letter’s signatories to discuss reforms. “We know that as a sector we can and must do better,” said chief executive Kate Henderson.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

Some people are asking for changes in social housing. They want housing groups to care more about people than about money. This comes after a report in a newspaper called ""The Observer."" The report was about a black woman who became homeless.

Her neighbours were racist to her. Some important people who used to work in social housing are worried. These people are Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin, and Barry Simons. They wrote a letter to the National Housing Federation.

The letter says that social housing groups are not doing enough to help people who are being harassed because of their race. The letter asks for a quick review of the rules. They want people who harass others to be evicted. They also want victims of harassment to be given new homes first.

The group wrote the letter after reading about Laura Tate (not her real name). She has been homeless for five years. She had to leave her flat because people were threatening to kill her.

Her housing group is called London and Quadrant (L&Q). L&Q did not evict the people who were hurting her. These people were found guilty of harassment. L&Q also did not give Laura Tate a new home.

A judge gave her £31,000 because L&Q did not do enough to protect her. She took L&Q to court.

""The Observer"" also wrote about another black woman. She lived in a safe house for two years. She ran away from her ex-partner who was hurting her. L&Q did not give her a new home because they said she did not have enough proof that she was in danger.

Lord Filkin said that these problems are not just happening once. He said that the people in charge of housing should make sure that everyone can live in peace. He said they need to do more.

L&Q has many houses in the south-east of England. They have said they will check how they handle cases of abuse. This is because of ""The Observer"" report.

L&Q said that they can learn from this. They said they do not accept any kind of discrimination.

The National Housing Federation speaks for many housing groups. They said they will meet with the people who wrote the letter. They want to talk about changes. Kate Henderson, who is in charge, said that they need to do better."

Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him. No doubt the chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten – who was the last British governor of Hong Kong – will be sympathetic.

Many students died at Tiananmen Square. So, it is good for other universities to remember them. These universities should not let their bravery be forgotten.

Universities in the UK should remember these students. Some universities have many Chinese students. These universities could name a building or part of a building after them.

They did this before for Steve Biko. Steve Biko was a student from South Africa who fought against apartheid. The government killed him.

Bradford University used to have a bar named after Steve Biko. It closed in 2005. Manchester University still has a student union building named after him. It is the biggest student union in the UK.

Chris Patten is in charge of Oxford University. He used to be the British governor of Hong Kong. He will probably understand why remembering Tiananmen Square is important.

21,21_0,0,"Confused anti-vaccine protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre, where they were filmed shouting abuse at staff and appearing to steal equipment. Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs.","Some people who don't want vaccines went to a building in Milton Keynes. This was on Wednesday. They thought it was a place where people get the coronavirus vaccine.

But it was a test centre. People go there to get tested for coronavirus.

The people shouted at the workers at the test centre. They also seemed to take things from the centre. Someone filmed it and put it on social media.

A group of people went to the test centre. There were many of them. A man named Jeff Wyatt was leading the group. He used to work for a political party called Ukip. They had signs that said people should not get the vaccine. The signs also said bad things about the BBC.

Jeff Wyatt spoke to the people before they went to the test centre. He said that many people don't want the vaccine. He said they have ""woken up.""

Another man named Piers Corbyn was also there. He does not want lockdowns. He is the brother of Jeremy Corbyn, who used to lead the Labour party. Piers Corbyn was at other places during the day. He went to the Milton Keynes Theatre too.

Someone used a loudspeaker and said the test centre was where they give the vaccine. The protesters walked past a sign that said ""Testing"". Some people shouted ""disgrace"" and ""shame on you"". The workers at the test centre ran away to be safe.

A woman took a sign that said ""Reclaim NHS, End Jab."" She also took a big box. It looked like it had testing things and papers inside. She was not wearing a mask. She smiled at the cameras as she left the test centre.

The police know about the protest in Milton Keynes. It happened on Wednesday afternoon. The police said they will find the people who did bad things. They will take them to court.

If you know anything about this, call the police. The number is 101. You can also tell them online. The reference number is 604 29/12/2021.

Many people said the protesters' actions were very bad. Members of Parliament (MPs) also said it was wrong."
21,21_1,1,"The local Tory MP Ben Everitt described the protesters as “dickheads” and urged anyone with information to contact police. Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow secretary of state for international trade, described the protest as “dreadful”, at a site where “NHS staff are working over the festive season to help others”. He urged anyone with information to pass this on to Thames Valley police. Former health secretary Matt Hancock criticised the activists’ “appalling behaviour”. The Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, Alicia Kearns, described the scenes as “shameful, self-aggrandising nonsense”. Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said the group’s actions were “totally unacceptable”. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scenes were “disgraceful”. “For months now we have been warning need legislation to tackle those who harass others seeking healthcare. Government promised to act weeks ago but nothing as yet. Enough. It’s not free speech when 50% of debate in fear,” she said. Matthew Barber, police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, said it was “appalling” to see the protest “escalate into something much uglier”. He added that he had spoken to Thames Valley police officers to discuss the police response on Wednesday evening, and said that “criminal offences will be investigated and appropriate action taken”. “All of the events of today will be reviewed to help plan for future protest events and ensure that colleagues in the NHS can continue their fantastic work in delivering the vaccine rollout,” he said. Joe Harrison, CEO of Milton Keynes University hospital, said: “I am very sorry and angry to see NHS colleagues at Milton Keynes Covid testing centre harassed and intimidated at their place of work. “Our staff having to deal with increasing aggression and violence for simply doing their job. It’s abhorrent, unacceptable and we will not stand for it.”","The local MP, Ben Everitt, was not happy with the people protesting. He said bad words about them. He asked people to tell the police if they had any information.

Nick Thomas-Symonds also said the protest was bad. He said that NHS workers are helping people during the holidays. He asked people to give information to the police.

Matt Hancock used to be in charge of health. He said the protesters were behaving very badly.

Alicia Kearns, another MP, said the protest was shameful and silly.

Helen Morgan, who is also an MP, said the group's actions were not okay.

Stella Creasy, another MP, said the protest was disgraceful. She said we need laws to stop people from bothering others who want to see a doctor. She said the government promised to do something, but nothing has happened yet. She said that when people are scared to speak, it is not really free speech.

Matthew Barber works with the police. He said the protest was getting worse and worse. He talked to police officers about what happened. He said the police will look into any crimes and do what is right. They will also look at what happened to help them plan for future protests. They want NHS workers to be able to do their important work of giving vaccines.

Joe Harrison is the boss of the hospital in Milton Keynes. He said he was sorry and angry to see NHS workers being bothered and scared at the Covid testing center. He said that his staff are facing more and more anger and violence just for doing their jobs. He said this is terrible and not okay. He said they will not allow it."
22,22_0,0,"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","Mudassar Kadir used to work for the BBC in Afghanistan. He had to leave the country because of the Taliban. It is not safe for him there.

The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August. Mr. Kadir is the only one of 14 former BBC workers who could escape. The other 13 are still hiding. They are afraid for their lives.

Mr. Kadir also worked for the World Bank and the old Afghan government. He wanted a new life for his family after leaving Afghanistan.

He left Afghanistan in October. A charity from the USA helped him. He is now in a refugee center near Dubai with his wife and two sons.

They are thankful to the United Arab Emirates for keeping them safe. They are taken care of well. But, they cannot go far from the refugee center. The UAE does not give asylum to people.

Mr. Kadir is angry. He asked the UK government for help, but they said no. He is still afraid of being sent back to Afghanistan. The Taliban might hurt him because he worked for the BBC.

He said the UK should help him and his family. He said his life is in danger because he worked for the BBC. He said the UK government knows this but has not helped him.

He hoped the UK would give him a visa. Now, he is more and more frustrated every day.

Some people are trying to help. They say his situation shows the problem for many Afghan people. These people cannot go back home because they are afraid. They also cannot go to other countries that will help them.

The UK government said they would help. They promised a program to help Afghan people. This program is called the Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme (ACRS). It will help up to 5,000 people each year, starting in January.

There is another program called Arap. But it is harder to get into. Mr. Kadir cannot use Arap.

He also cannot use ACRS yet. The ACRS program is not open. When it opens, only some organizations can refer people.

Some people worry that the UK government is waiting to start the program. They think the government wants to help fewer people."
22,22_1,1,"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office does not agree with this. They say their plan is very good. It will help up to 20,000 people who are in danger. These people will get a new life in the UK.

A person from the Home Office said they are working hard. They want to start the plan soon. It is difficult because things are changing. They are working with other groups to plan it.

The Home Office will not talk about single cases. They said the delay is because they are making a new system. This system will use special checks. It will check who can come to the UK. This will make sure the people who come are not dangerous.

The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants helps people like Kadir. They say there is not much time left.

Minnie Rahman works for the Council. She said the government promised to help Afghan refugees. But now, it seems like they are not helping.

She said many Afghans have been left alone by the British government. These Afghans have connections to the UK. The plan to help them is not ready. It is hard for families to join each other in the UK. The government is not helping people who risked their lives to work with them. These people need help now.

The National Union of Journalists is asking the government for help. They want visas for former Afghan BBC workers. One worker was attacked at his relative's house.

Michelle Stanistreet works for the Union. She said the plan to help people is going very slowly. The journalists are scared and hiding. She said the UK needs to help them quickly. They need to get to the UK safely.

Someone from the BBC said they feel bad for the former workers. But they cannot give them direct help.

Kadir said he hopes the UK government will help him and his family. But he thinks no one is helping him now. He came to the UAE two months ago. Nothing has happened since then.

Kadir's name has been changed to protect him."
23,23_0,0,"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","The new year is coming, and the world has many problems. These problems include:

*   Covid-19 is still a problem.
*   The weather is changing a lot, and it's dangerous.
*   Some countries are democracies, and some are not. They are arguing.
*   Many people need help with food and shelter.
*   Lots of people are moving to new countries.
*   Terrorism is still a problem in the world.

Also, countries might start fighting each other. It is hard to follow the rules of the world now. There are also new weapons that can decide to kill people by themselves. So, for most people on Earth, the next year might be dangerous.

**Middle East**

Things that happen in the Middle East will be in the news again next year. Some news will be good, and some will be bad.

One good thing is the World Cup soccer game. It starts in Qatar in November. This is the first time a Muslim country has the World Cup. This could help business and tourism in that area. Maybe the government will become more open too.

But some people think it was not a good idea to choose Qatar. Some people said there was cheating. Also, they do not treat people very well. Many workers from other countries work for little money. Many of these workers died while building new things for the World Cup.

People are also worried about free speech in Qatar. It is not safe to say bad things about the government. It is also not okay to be gay in Qatar.

But some people think that fans will not think about these problems. They will just watch the games. This could make Qatar look good, even if it is not.

Other problems will also be in the news from the Middle East. One big problem is Iran. Some people think Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons. Iran says this is not true. Israel may attack Iran if the talks do not work. Even soccer fans will notice if there is a war in the Middle East."
23,23_1,1,"Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

**Turkey**

People will watch Turkey and its leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He is a powerful president. His party, AKP, has been in power for 20 years in 2022. Erdoğan is becoming more strict in Turkey. He also has a strong foreign policy. He has problems with the EU and the US. He sometimes works with Russia about Syria. He also has problems with the economy. This could cause problems in the future.

**Lebanon and Libya**

Lebanon is in trouble. It might become a failed country, like Yemen, where there is war. Libya is always chaotic. People should also watch these countries.

**Palestine**

Palestine is also important. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, is not popular. He stopped elections from happening. There is violence from Israeli settlers. People are taking land in the West Bank. There is no peace process happening. These things are big problems.

**Asia Pacific: China**

The world will watch China a lot this year. The Winter Olympics will be in Beijing in February. Many people like sports. But the Olympics might not be just about sports. The US, UK, and other countries are not happy with China. They say China treats people badly. They might not send important people to the Olympics. They think China will use the Olympics to show how good it is.

Later in the year, China will have an important meeting. It is the Chinese Communist Party's 20th national congress. The leader, Xi Jinping, wants to stay in power for five more years. This would be his third time. If this happens, he will be the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong. People will also try to get important jobs in the government.

Not everything might go as Xi Jinping wants. Some people think he is strong. Other people are not so sure. The economy is not growing fast. China has a lot of debt. The population is getting older. There are big problems with the environment. The US is trying to stop China from getting too powerful. The US is working with countries near China. All of this is making things difficult for Xi Jinping.

But in 2022, China will probably keep trying to be more powerful in the world. China wants to have more economic and political power."
23,23_2,2,"A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister.","A war with Taiwan could change everything. China wants to take Taiwan back, even by force.

India is a big rival to China. India may become as big as China soon. Some people think India will have as many people as China's 1.41 billion. But, Indian families are getting smaller.

India and China have problems with their border in the mountains. They fought in 2020 and 2021. This shows their relationship is getting worse.

Narendra Modi is the leader of India. He is becoming less popular because of the sickness and money problems. He had to change a plan about farms. People say he uses laws about terrorists to stop people who disagree with him. His party will try to win elections in 2022.

Modi wants India to be friends with countries like the USA, Japan, and Australia. This makes China unhappy.

In Myanmar, the government is hurting people. In Afghanistan, people are suffering after the Taliban took over. Rich countries will probably worry, but not do much to help. Afghanistan is in big trouble.

David Beasley says that 23 million people may starve in Afghanistan. He works for the World Food Programme. He says the next six months will be very bad.

North Korea has nuclear weapons. The leader, Kim Jong-un, is making threats. He may start a war.

The Philippines will have a new leader. The old leader, Rodrigo Duterte, can only be leader for one term.

Scott Morrison wants to be the leader of Australia again."
23,23_3,3,"Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine.","Europe will have a very important year. The EU and leaders of countries must deal with problems inside and outside of Europe.

The pandemic is still here. It affects people and the economy. There are also problems with people moving to Europe. New rules about pollution are also making things difficult. These rules are about stopping pollution by a certain date.

Europe needs to decide what it wants. Does it want other countries to respect it? Or will it let China, the US, and Russia have more power?

Important elections will happen in France and Hungary in the spring. In these countries, some groups want to make people fight.

Viktor Orbán is the leader of Hungary. Some people think he is not fair. He does not always follow the rules of the EU about law, freedom, and saying what you think. For the first time, people who disagree with him are working together. People in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and other countries are watching this. They have similar groups in their countries.

Emmanuel Macron is the leader of France. He wants people in France to vote for him again. He is against people who do not like people from other countries or religions, like Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Some polls say he will win. But he might also have a hard time with another person called Valérie Pécresse. She is the first woman to lead a big group in France. Some people think the left is not strong. So, the election could make France more against new ideas.

There will also be elections in Sweden, Serbia and Austria.

Germany has a new government. People will watch it closely to see if it does things differently after Angela Merkel. There might be problems between Germany and the EU. Ursula von der Leyen leads the EU. She is a friend of Angela Merkel. There might also be problems with France and other countries about money.

France will lead the EU in January. Macron will try to make Europe work together on safety. He thinks Europe should be able to protect itself. This idea will be tested in places like Ukraine."
23,23_4,4,"Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world.","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR B1 level:

**Europe**

Experts think Russia might cause more problems. Russia has many soldiers near its border. They might use nuclear weapons. This could cause a new war soon. NATO may not want to get involved.

Other problems could start in Belarus. Belarus is using people who want to move to other countries as a weapon. Europe does not have a good plan for these people.

There may also be trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and other places in the Balkans. Some people there want to break away from their countries.

The European Union (EU) will talk to China. They need to decide how to do business with China and protect human rights. It is hard to find a good balance.

Britain is having problems after leaving the EU (Brexit). Many people are not happy with Brexit now. Britain is also becoming poorer.

Britain's relationship with the United States (US) might be difficult. The US does not like Europe being too independent. The US is not sure what to do about Ukraine.

NATO is in a difficult situation. It lost trust after what happened in Afghanistan. They need a new leader. Many people think a woman will be the new leader. Theresa May, the former leader of Britain, could be chosen. But France probably will not want someone from Britain.

**Latin America**

Brazil will have elections in October. It will be a big fight to defeat Jair Bolsonaro. He is the current president of Brazil, and he is very right-wing. This election is important for the whole world.

Many people in Brazil are not happy with Bolsonaro. They say he did not handle the COVID-19 pandemic well. Many people in Brazil died from COVID-19. Only the US had more deaths.

People outside Brazil also dislike Bolsonaro. He does not believe in climate change. He is letting people destroy the Amazon rainforest.

The polls say that Lula da Silva will win against Bolsonaro if both are candidates. Lula da Silva used to be the president. He was in jail but now he is free.

But some people are worried about the election. They think Bolsonaro may try to steal the election or take over the government, like Trump tried to do in the US. Some Americans who support Trump are teaching Bolsonaro how to do this. People are worried that more leaders will try to steal elections like Trump."
23,23_5,5,"Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision.","In Europe, some people think right-wing leaders are becoming less popular. But this might not be true in South America, except for Brazil. It might also not be true in other poorer countries in 2022.

Populism happens when there is a big difference between rich leaders and normal people. In many poor countries, this difference is getting bigger. The rich have more money and power.

In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who said they would help people are now hurting them. This may continue to happen.

In Chile, the first election was good for José Antonio Kast. He is a very right-wing person who supported Pinochet. But he lost the final election to Gabriel Boric. Boric is a left-wing leader who used to be a student. He will be the youngest leader of Chile.

In Argentina, the president, Alberto Fernández, will have a difficult year. His party, called the Peronists, lost power in Congress. This is the first time in 40 years.

In Mexico, the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will have problems with the United States. They will disagree about trade, drugs, and people moving from Central America. But at least he does not have to deal with insults from Trump anymore.

In North America, everyone will watch the elections in November. The Democrats will try to keep control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Republicans want to win them back.

The election results will show how people feel about Joe Biden, the president. If the Republicans do well, Donald Trump might try to become president again in 2024. He still says he won the 2020 election, but this is not true.

Some important problems will affect the whole country. These problems are:

*   The virus: Will the virus get better or worse? Some people still do not want to get shots.
*   The economy: Prices and interest rates will probably go up.
*   Social issues: People disagree about people moving to the country, race, and abortion. The Supreme Court might change the rules about abortion."
23,23_6,6,"The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September.","The Democrats have a big problem in 2022. They don't agree with each other. There are two groups: progressives and moderates. They disagree in the Senate. This made Biden's plans for social care and roads weaker. The plans cost a lot of money.

People will watch Biden. Will he run for president again in 2024? He will be 80 years old in November. Can he still think clearly? Can he do what he wants to do? In December, many people did not like Biden. It may be hard to change their minds.

Kamala Harris is the vice-president. People are also watching her. Some people say she is not happy. They say she is not doing a good job. Maybe these people want to cause problems in the White House.

Pete Buttigieg is in charge of transportation. He wanted to be president in 2020. He is important to watch. Maybe he could replace Harris. Or maybe he could replace Biden, if Biden only stays president for one term.

Some people are worried about the mid-term elections. Will they be fair? Republican leaders in some states are making it harder to vote. They are also drawing voting maps to help Republicans win. It is harder for the other parties to win. One study says Republicans will win at least five more seats in the House because of these maps. This could give Republicans control of the House before the voting even starts.

Many people from Central America want to come to the US. They are going to the border. This will probably be a problem in 2022. Harris was supposed to help with this problem. But she has not done well so far. People say she and Biden are using the same strict rules as Trump.

People also think Biden is not doing a good job. The US left Afghanistan in a hurry. It was a mess. Some people think it was like the US losing in Vietnam.

If something bad happens in another country, it could hurt Biden. For example, if Russia takes land in Ukraine, or if China attacks Taiwan, or if Israel and Iran fight. The US might have to get involved. This could ruin Biden's time as president.

In Canada, Justin Trudeau is the leader. He won another election in September. He wants to make new plans for childcare and houses that people can afford."
23,23_7,7,"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","Here's the rewritten text, simplified to CEFR B1 level:

**Canada**

In 2021, there was an election in Canada. Justin Trudeau's party won. But they did not get many votes. It was the lowest number of votes for a winning party ever. Some people think Trudeau is not as popular as before.

There are some problems now. People are talking about possible bad actions. They are also talking about how the government handled the virus. Trade with the United States is another problem. Also, there are different ideas about reducing carbon use.

**Africa**

Africa is a very big place. Many important things will happen there in 2022. One big question is about vaccines. Rich countries have most of the vaccines. They don't want to share them. Africa may suffer because of this. They may pay a high price because of this. This could hurt their health and their money.

Will this selfishness hurt the rich countries too? Gordon Brown, a former leader of the UK, thinks it might. The Omicron virus started in South Africa. This shows that more viruses could appear in 2022.

Rich countries might only try to protect themselves. They might not help other countries. We don't know what will happen with the virus in 2022. It could hurt people's health and their money.

Many people in Africa are young. They might not get very sick from the virus. But the virus could make other health problems worse. Many people in Africa have HIV-Aids. About 25 million people will have it in 2022. Many people die from malaria every year. About 400,000 people die. It will be harder to treat these diseases because of the virus. Diseases like TB and diabetes will also be harder to treat.

Some people think Africa is now a big center for terrorism. It is like the Middle East was before. This may continue in 2022. The Sahel area in Africa has many new groups of radical Muslims. They are from Africa, but they are connected to groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western countries might try to stop these groups in 2022. They might try to stop the violence."
23,23_8,8,"This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought.","The leaders of the US and France, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, made an agreement to work together. France stopped its military work in Mali because it did not have enough help.

Many countries are worried. They see that radical Islamist ideas are spreading in Africa. These ideas come from countries like Nigeria. They are going to other countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique. These countries have a lot of energy resources.

Somalia is a country with many problems. The group al-Shabaab is active there. Somalia shows what can happen when terrorism is not stopped.

The US will have another meeting about democracy. The meeting is called ""summit for democracy."" The problem of global democratic governance will be important. This means that many countries do not have good governments. This is a big problem in Africa. In 2021, some countries in Africa had coups. Sudan was one of them.

Poverty is a big problem in Africa. It is connected to the problem of bad governments. The International Rescue Committee is a charity. They say that 12 of the 20 countries with the biggest risk of humanitarian crises are in Africa. These countries are: Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon.

Other countries also have problems. These countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.

In the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia has many problems. There is a civil war. This war could break up the country. Eritrea is a nearby country. It is getting involved in the war.

The United Nations says that the drought is getting worse in Somalia. By April, 7.7 million people in Somalia could be in danger.

Unicef is a charity that helps children. They need $9.4 billion to help people around the world. They want to help 327 million people, including 177 million children. These people are having problems because of crises and Covid.

These problems create another big challenge: international migration. People are leaving their homes. Some are refugees from wars. Some are looking for asylum because they are being treated badly in their countries. Some are economic migrants. They are leaving because of climate change, hunger, and drought."
23,23_9,9,"The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars.","The United Nations says that many people moved to other countries in 2020. The number is about 281 million people. That is 3.6% of all people in the world.

This number is still going up. This is happening even though it is hard to move between countries now. This is because of the pandemic.

Many people are moving, but governments are not working together to help. Rich countries in North America and Europe are not doing much. Maybe this will change in 2022, but it is not likely.

There will be a meeting about climate change in Egypt in November. It is called Cop27. This meeting is after another meeting in Glasgow about climate change.

At the meeting, people will talk about what they promised to do in Glasgow. They promised to use less carbon, stop cutting down trees, use less coal, and help poor countries.

It is not likely that the world's climate will get better quickly. We will probably have very bad weather again this year. We saw bad weather like fires, dry weather, floods, storms, and hot days in 2021.

The bad weather will hurt the Earth a lot. The Arctic and Antarctic areas are very sensitive. They will be affected a lot.

There will be more people going to the Arctic and Antarctic in 2022. This is not good.

For example, many tourists are going to Antarctica. They are using big planes that can land on the ice.

Also, China and other countries want to use the resources in Antarctica. They also want to build military bases there. This is a problem.

The ice in the Arctic is melting. This makes it possible to sail across the top of the world. Russia is building new paths for ships. Other countries are also trying to do this.

Greenland has many minerals. Mining companies want to mine there. Defence people are also interested in Greenland. But the people who live there do not want to give permission for this.

There will also be a lot of activity in space this year. People will explore space and compete with each other.

NASA is planning 18 missions in 2022. They want to send people to the moon again. They are planning a new space station called Gateway.

Russia, South Korea, India, and Japan will send spaceships to the moon. The European Space Agency will send a mission to Mars."
23,23_10,10,"China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR level B1:

China wants to have a space station soon. They hope it will work well by the end of this year.

Also, space travel for fun is starting. Russia and companies like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are doing this. Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos own these companies.

But there is also a problem. Countries might start a fight with weapons in space. This could be very bad.

The US, Russia, and China are trying out new weapons. For example, they are testing vehicles that can fly very fast around the Earth. These vehicles can launch missiles from space.

Russia made people angry in 2021. They tested a missile that can destroy satellites. Other countries might do the same thing. This could cause problems for how we talk to each other around the world. Satellites help us communicate.

NASA has a different plan. NASA wants to change the way an asteroid moves. They will hit the asteroid with a spacecraft. This will happen in September. Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, made the rocket for this mission.

The US says this is to protect the Earth. They call it ""planetary defense."" But this technology could also be used to attack.

Some people think this is progress. Other people think it is a bad thing for everyone."
24,24_0,0,"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails.","A lot of scientists and doctors in the UK who helped the government during the pandemic were treated very badly. A survey by a newspaper called The Guardian asked these experts about their experiences.

Many experts said they were scared and threatened. Some people attacked them online in a planned way. Some experts even got death threats.

Other bad things happened too. People took pictures of the experts' houses and put them on the internet. Some experts got strange packages in the mail with bad messages written on them.

The experts also got nasty emails, tweets, and phone calls. Some people sent hate mail or threatened violence. Some people complained to the experts' bosses. Some people even reported them to the medical council. People left rude notes on their cars or shouted bad things through their doors.

The police caught some people who made threats. But this was not often.

It was not just the experts who were targeted. Their students, work friends, and families were also treated badly. This included their partners and children.

One doctor said that people were very rude to the receptionists at the doctor's office. This happened because the doctor was helping the government.

In another case, a teacher was mean to a child because the child's parent was giving advice to the government about lockdowns. The family did not complain because they were worried about the child's grades.

The Guardian newspaper sent the survey to more than 100 scientists, doctors, and researchers. These people gave advice to the government through groups like SAGE and Nervtag.

The answers from the survey were kept secret. 42 experts answered the survey. Three out of four said they were badly treated because of what they thought about the science, government rules, or their research. This often happened after they spoke to the news or at public events.

Professor John Edmunds, who works at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and is part of SAGE, said he and his workers often got rude emails. He wrote about this in The Guardian newspaper."
24,24_1,1,"“If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers.","He said that if you talk about vaccines in the news, especially vaccines for children, people will probably react. This happens if newspapers like the Daily Mail write about what you said.

One of the people giving advice got a very bad message on Twitter. Someone said they would kill them. They told the police about it. When this person was on TV or in the newspaper, they got a lot of mean messages.

One doctor said that many messages were about hating women. She said they were very bad. She had never seen anything like it before. She said she was only trying to help people not die.

Many of these messages come from people who are more afraid of what the government is doing about the pandemic than the pandemic itself. But the people giving advice do not make the rules.

Many advisers say that the bad messages get worse when they talk about masks, vaccines, medicine for COVID, or lockdowns. This means the messages are getting worse because the Omicron disease is spreading.

When the pandemic started last year, there were many bad messages. So, government security people told the advisers how to stay safe. They told them how to make their computers safer. They also told them to change when they went to work and what road they took. They also told them to check under their car before they drove.

Some advisers had their homes and offices checked by security people. They put in alarms and cameras that watch all the time. The cameras are connected to the police station.

Some universities hired security companies to help the experts stay safe. They also made sure that people who were protesting did not stop them from working.

Government computer experts have taken down some private information from the internet. But they could not take everything down.

Many advisers said they got many hateful messages on Twitter and in emails. The messages said things like ""I hope your family die,"" and very bad words. Some messages said they would be punished for giving vaccines to children.

Some people said that the news made things worse. They said the news talked about the worst things that could happen. They also said the news made it okay to send bad messages to the advisers."
24,24_2,2,"The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR B1 level:

The survey looked at how people treated men and women. It did not find that women were hurt more than men. But some women did not want to talk about what happened to them.

Many men were sad about the bad things said to women they knew. One man said that women were treated much worse than men.

Some people were very mean. But some advisors also said they got good messages. People thanked them and helped them. This made the bad messages less important. One advisor said that the bad messages did not bother him anymore.

George Freeman is a science minister. He said the bad messages were terrible. He said everyone should say that this is wrong. Scientists and doctors should not be blamed for what ministers decide. Ministers are responsible to the government.

Chi Onwurah is also a science minister. She said the bad messages were not okay. She said the government needs to do something about wrong information online.

Many advisors said that the government helped them a lot. But some advisors wished they had gotten warnings before they started. They also wanted safety advice.

Because of the bad attention, some scientists do not want to talk. They do not want interviews. They are thinking about stopping talking to the public.

But most advisors said the bad messages did not affect them much. Some even felt stronger. One advisor said it made him want to talk more. He said that people were listening to him.

Another advisor said that if they stop talking, bad information will spread. He asked if they should let bad information take over and risk people's lives."
25,25_0,0,"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban].","Ashraf Ghani used to be the president of Afghanistan. He has now spoken for the first time since he left Kabul four months ago. Kabul is the capital city of Afghanistan. Ghani said the world and especially the Americans are to blame for the problems in Afghanistan.

Ghani told the BBC that he had to leave Kabul quickly. His security advisor, Hamdullah Mohib, was very scared. He and the head of Ghani's security team told him to leave by helicopter.

Ghani said they told him the security team was failing. They said if he stayed, everyone would die. Ghani said Mohib only gave him two minutes to decide.

Ghani spoke to General Nick Carter. Carter used to be in charge of the British army. He was working as a guest editor for a radio show.

The Taliban were taking control of Afghanistan before Ghani left. When Ghani left quickly, it stopped any chance of a peaceful change of power. This meant that aid stopped coming to Afghanistan. There were also no plans for everyone to work together in the government.

Now, many people in Afghanistan are hungry. The country's money problems are very bad. The health and schools are in trouble because foreign money stopped coming. They needed this money to survive.

Carter asked Ghani what he would say to the Afghan people. Many people in Afghanistan think Ghani is to blame for the problems. Ghani said his biggest mistake was trusting the countries that helped Afghanistan.

Ghani said people can blame him for this, and they are right to do so. He trusted the world to help. He thought the world would be patient, but he was wrong.

Ghani said the United States did not include his government in talks with the Taliban. These talks were about peace. Ghani said the deals the US made with the Taliban caused problems for the Afghan people. The US wanted to leave Afghanistan quickly.

Ghani said the US team is responsible for what happened. He said his government never had a chance to talk to the Taliban."
25,25_1,1,"Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue. They erased us.” Khalilzad said in his own interview with the Today programme that the collapse of the republic was due to a “failure of Afghan leadership” and Afghan troops that did not “resist hard” against the Taliban. Six months ago the two men were among the most influential figures shaping Afghanistan’s future; now neither are willing to accept any responsibility for the tragedy stalking the country. Carter asked the former president about any personal regrets that had surfaced in the last 100 days. Ghani did not mention the humanitarian crisis, but he lamented the damage to his reputation and legacy. “My work has been destroyed. My values have been trampled on, and I’ve been made a scapegoat.”","Here's a B1 level rewrite of the provided text:

Ambassador Khalilzad talked to some people. After that, it became a problem for America. It was not just a problem for Afghanistan anymore. They forgot about us.

Khalilzad also spoke to the Today programme. He said Afghanistan failed because Afghan leaders were not good. He also said the Afghan soldiers did not fight the Taliban hard enough.

Six months ago, two men were very important in Afghanistan. They helped to decide what would happen in the future. Now, they don't want to say they made any mistakes. Afghanistan is having a very bad time.

Carter asked the former president if he felt sorry about anything in the last few months. Ghani did not talk about the people who need help. But he was sad that people thought badly of him. He said his work was ruined. He said his values were not respected. He said people were blaming him for everything."
26,26_0,0,"Thousands of South Africans will pause to remember the anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90, every day this week as bells are rung at churches across the country for 10 minutes at noon. Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country.","This week, people in South Africa will remember Desmond Tutu. He was a famous person who fought against apartheid. Apartheid was a system where people of different colors were not treated equally.

Desmond Tutu died on Sunday. He was 90 years old. Churches all over South Africa will ring their bells for him. The bells will ring for 10 minutes at 12 o'clock every day.

People are saying good things about Desmond Tutu. They say he was a good person who showed his country the right way to go. People from all over the world are sad that he died. He died in a home in Cape Town.

There will be many events to remember his life. Barack Obama, who used to be the president of the USA, said Desmond Tutu cared about justice. He cared about his own country and about other places too.

Desmond Tutu won a big prize called the Nobel Prize. People will be able to see his body for two days. Then, on January 1, there will be a funeral. It will be at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town. This was his church.

The bells at the church will ring every day until Friday. This is to honor him. Many memorial services will also happen in South Africa. The flags will be lowered to show respect.

Archbishop Thabo Makgoba said the bells will ring at 12 o'clock. This will happen at St George's Cathedral and other churches. In Cape Town, people will say a special prayer.

South Africa still has problems. There is inequality and disagreement. The death of Desmond Tutu has made people feel united for a short time.

People are going to St George's Cathedral. They are leaving flowers under a picture of him. They are also writing in a book to show they are sad.

Miriam Mokwadi is a retired nurse. She said Desmond Tutu was a hero. He fought for them. She said they are free because of him. Without him, South Africa might have been lost."
26,26_1,1,"He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo. Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party.","""He was very good,"" said Mokwadi. She held her granddaughter's hand. Brent Goliath was sad. He cried outside the church. The church was old and made of stone. Brent said Tutu was important. He was not just important for people who go to the Anglican church. Brent used to help at the church. He met Tutu many times. ""I was very sad this morning,"" he said. He heard that Tutu had died. ""I am thankful to God that he helped us,"" he said. He wiped his eyes. He put pink flowers under a picture of Tutu.

Daphney Ramakgopa is 58 years old. She works for the local government. She said the whole country is sad. ""We respected him,"" she said. ""He gave advice to everyone, especially the politicians.""

The South African cricket team played a game against India. They wore black bands on their arms. They did this to show respect for Tutu. Table Mountain is in Cape Town. It was lit up with purple lights. This was to honor him.

Cyril Ramaphosa is the president of South Africa. He said Tutu was very smart and honest. He was strong against apartheid. Apartheid was a bad system in South Africa. It treated people unfairly. Ramaphosa said Tutu's death is sad. He said many great South Africans have died. They helped South Africa become free. FW de Klerk died in November. He was president during apartheid.

Graça Machel is Nelson Mandela's wife. She said fighting for freedom in South Africa needed a lot of courage. It was very hard.

Tutu was not in the news much lately. But he still worked for things he believed in. He helped LGBT people. He wanted everyone to have equal education. He also helped people who wanted to die with help from a doctor. Tutu was a nice man. He laughed a lot. He seemed easy to talk to. But he was very strong in his beliefs. He also said what he thought about the African National Congress party. This party is in charge of South Africa now."
26,26_2,2,"Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer.","The rules about Covid in South Africa say only 100 people can go to the funeral. The church said that many people want to come, but there is not enough space.

The funeral will be an Anglican church service. It will be like Archbishop Desmond Tutu wanted. Michael Nuttall will lead the service. He used to be a bishop. People called him ""number 2 to Tutu.""

Nuttall and Tutu were good friends in the 1980s. They showed how a white leader and a black leader could work together. That is what the church people told the reporters.

Tutu was born in a small town called Klerksdorp. It is near Johannesburg. He was born on October 7, 1931.

He used to be a teacher. He quit his job because he did not like the unfair laws in South Africa. This was in 1958. The laws were called apartheid.

Tutu studied religion in the UK. In the UK, white police officers called him ""Sir."" He was surprised because this did not happen in South Africa.

Tutu became more and more important in the church. In the late 1970s, he was a leader in the fight for freedom. People knew him in other countries. He helped make leaders in other countries see that they should not support the unfair government in South Africa.

In 1984, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize. He believed in fighting without using violence. Soon after, he became the archbishop of Cape Town.

In 1994, Mandela became president. This was after the first free elections in South Africa. Tutu called South Africa the ""Rainbow Nation."" He also led a group that told the truth about the bad things that happened during apartheid.

Tutu also criticized the new leaders of South Africa. He told Mandela, who was his friend, that the government workers were getting too much money. He also criticized President Jacob Zuma, who was president until 2018, because people said he was stealing money.

Tutu got sick with cancer in 1997. He had treatment many times. He did not go out in public very often after that."

The archbishop had been in a weakened state for several months and died peacefully at 7am (0500 GMT) on Sunday, according to several of his relatives. The Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu “an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.”","He left the hospital in a wheelchair. This happened near the end of the year. He was getting a Covid-19 vaccine. He waved to people, but he did not say anything.

The Nelson Mandela Foundation spoke about Tutu. They said he was a very special person. He thought a lot. He was a leader. He was like a shepherd taking care of people."
27,27_0,0,"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","This was a very bad year for human rights in Russia. It started with Alexei Navalny going to jail. Then, a very important group called International Memorial was closed. This was a cruel thing to do.

International Memorial started in the 1980s. Andrei Sakharov and other people who disagreed with the Soviet government started it. The Soviet Union was the name of Russia a long time ago.

When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader, things became more free. International Memorial used this freedom. They told the truth about what happened to many people under Stalin. Stalin was a leader who killed many people.

International Memorial showed that Russia was becoming more open. It helped people learn about their families. Many Russians found out sad things about their parents and grandparents. For many years, these things were secret.

Closing International Memorial is a bad sign. It shows that the government is taking apart groups that help people. The leaders of International Memorial hoped people would help them. They thought that famous Russians like Gorbachev would help.

They also thought that the government would not close them. They believed that closing a group that told the truth about the Soviet Union was too much. But on Tuesday, a judge closed them. This was 30 years after the Soviet Union ended.

Nikita Petrov helped start International Memorial. He said he never thought things would get so bad. He thought Russia would become a country with laws and freedom.

It is easy to see why Putin does not like International Memorial. Putin is the leader of Russia now. He thinks a lot about history. He thinks about Crimea, Nato, and the Soviet Union. He also thinks about World War Two.

Putin thinks that learning about Soviet history is bad for Russia. He cares more about bad things that happened to Russia in the past. He does not care about the truth that International Memorial found in the archives.

International Memorial said that Russia needs to understand its Soviet past. They said this is important for the future. They said this after they were closed."
27,27_1,1,"In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","Instead of Memorial, the government wants to show the deaths of millions in a different way. Memorial talked openly about terrible things that happened. The government wants to show the deaths in a more careful way.

They want to say that the deaths were bad, but not talk about who killed the people. They want to name the people who died, but not the people who did the killings.

The Russian government says that closing Memorial is just following the rules about ""foreign agents."" But in court, a lawyer for the government said something else. He said that Memorial was wrongly showing the USSR (Soviet Union) as a bad country. He said Memorial was showing the USSR like a country that uses terror.

The government lawyer asked why they should see people who betrayed their country and helped the Nazis being made to look good. He said that they are the children of the people who won the war.

A lawyer for Memorial said this reminded him of a fake trial from the 1930s.

The people in charge of Memorial do not know why the government closed them down. They don't know what they did wrong.

Some people think it is because Memorial kept records about bad things the Soviet Union did. Others think it is because Memorial helped people in jail for political reasons, like Navalny.

But the truth is that Memorial kept doing the same things. It is Russia that has changed. Maybe Russia is no longer okay with people talking honestly about its past.

Kenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch said that the government is afraid. He said that the government does not want Memorial to show what it is doing. He said that if the truth is bad, the government should change its actions, not try to hide the truth."
28,28_0,0,"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","Some towns in Spain are doing something new. They are letting women take time off work when they have their period. This is to help women feel better at work when they have pain from their period.

The city of Girona was the first in Spain to do this. They said that women who work for the city can work in a different way if they feel bad because of their period.

In June, Girona said that women, trans men, and people who are not men or women can take up to eight hours off each month. But they need to work those hours later, within three months.

Maria Àngels Planas is the deputy mayor of Girona. She said that Girona is doing something special. She said they are the first to have this rule about time off for periods. She also said that they want to talk more about periods. She wants people to know that some women have pain during their period.

After Girona, two more towns in Spain, Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques, made the same rule.

Then, the city of Castellón de la Plana also said that they would let women take time off for their period. They have 1,500 workers, and they agreed to the rule after some women asked for it.

In Asia, some countries have had these rules for a long time. They thought that work could make it hard for women to have babies.

In 2016, some women in Japan and China said they did not want to use this time off. They were afraid that men at work would be angry. They also thought it could make it harder to get a better job.

In 2016, a company in England called Coexist said they would also let women take time off for their period. They wanted to make it easier for women to work when they felt bad. They did not want women to have to use sick days or vacation days.

This idea started a big talk around the world. Some people thought it was a good idea, and some did not. The people at Coexist said that women were working harder and doing better. A study said that 14% of women had taken time off from work or school because of their period.

The workers in Girona thought about this and decided to make the new rule about time off for periods."
28,28_1,1,"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","Sílvia Rubio works for a union called Intersindical-CSC. She said there were many problems.

At first, the union wanted women to have two days off each month. But they stopped this idea. They thought companies might not want to hire women. Companies might not give women important jobs.

Rubio said they changed the idea. Now, women can take time off, but they must work those hours later. This way, there is no unfairness.

It was hard to talk to the city council. The union first wanted 16 hours off each month. But they had to change it to eight hours.

Some people in the union did not like the idea. This was a surprise. Rubio said there was a lot of disagreement.

Some women said, ""My husband has bad headaches. Why can't he have time off?"" Other women worried the idea would make women look bad. They worried people would think periods are always painful.

Rubio said the idea is important. She said it is good they made this happen. She said periods are a women's issue everywhere. People are ashamed to talk about it. No one is doing anything about it. But they did it.

Rubio does not want this to be the end. She wants to make work better. She wants to help people with long-term sickness. She wants to help people who take care of others.

She said this will help men and women. It will help people who work for the government and people who work for companies."
29,29_0,0,"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has a very high number of new coronavirus cases. This is a record for France and Europe. The Omicron virus is making many people sick. Other countries also have a lot of new cases.

On Wednesday, France said that 208,000 people got sick in one day. The day before, almost 180,000 people got sick. This was also a record.

The health minister said that every second, two people in France are getting the virus. He said this is a very difficult situation. The number of sick people is increasing very fast.

The hospitals in France are already worried because of the Delta virus. The Omicron virus has not made the hospitals much busier yet. But the health minister said it will happen soon.

The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Greece also have a lot of new cases this week. In the USA, there are also many new cases. On Tuesday, the average was 267,000 new cases each day for a week. Omicron is causing 59% of these cases.

In Australia, almost 18,300 people got sick on Wednesday. The day before, about 11,300 people got sick. The prime minister said Australia needs to change how they are dealing with the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the Delta and Omicron viruses are spreading at the same time. This is causing a big wave of sickness. More people may need to go to the hospital and some people may die.

The head of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is very worried. He said that Omicron is spreading fast, like a tsunami.

The WHO said that Omicron is a very big problem. It could make the hospitals too full.

Studies show that Omicron might not be as dangerous as other viruses. But many people are getting sick. This means that hospitals in some countries could have too many patients. Businesses might have problems because workers need to stay home.

The virus spreads very quickly. Governments are trying to find a good way to protect people in hospitals. They also want to keep the economy and society open. It's difficult to do both."
29,29_1,1,"Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10, even as the number of new infections hit record highs, after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

**Changes in Rules about Covid-19**

Spain had a rule: If you had Covid-19, you had to stay home for ten days. Now, Spain changed this rule. You only need to stay home for seven days. This happened because many businesses were worried. They thought too many workers would be sick. This would make it hard to do business.

Italy also made some changes. If you have had three Covid-19 shots, you do not need to stay home if you are near someone with Covid-19.

Italy also has new rules for people who did not get the vaccine. From January 10, you need a health pass to travel. This pass shows you got the vaccine or you had Covid-19 and got better. You need the pass to use buses, trains, and planes in Italy. The government talked about more rules for workers who are not vaccinated, but they did not agree on it.

In Italy, 98,030 new people got Covid-19 on Wednesday. This is the most new cases in one day ever.

In France, the government is talking about a new law. This law says that only people with the vaccine can go to some places. These places include bars, restaurants, and cinemas. You also need the vaccine to go to museums and sports places. A negative Covid-19 test will not be enough.

Italy is not the only country with new rules. Many countries have stopped big parties. This is because of the virus.

Greece also has new rules. They stopped parties for Christmas and New Year's Day. Now, they have new rules for restaurants and bars. These places must close at midnight. People cannot stand up to drink. There is no music allowed. But on New Year's Eve, they can stay open until 2 AM.

The health minister in Greece said that if everyone follows the rules, things can go back to normal in the middle of January.

Germany is waiting for more people to get sick with the new virus. Right now, fewer people are getting sick. But the health minister said that the real number of sick people might be higher. He thinks this because fewer people are getting tested because of the holidays. He said the real number could be much bigger than what they are reporting. He thinks more people will get sick very soon."
29,29_2,2,"On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors. It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events. Lauterbach said the rules may have to be toughened further, as existing measures “will not be enough to prevent a significant rise in Omicron cases”. In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated.","Okay, here's the rewritten text, following your instructions:

**Rewritten Text (CEFR B1 Level):**

On Tuesday, Germany made new rules. They closed nightclubs. Sports events must happen without people watching.

Also, people can only have small parties. If everyone has the vaccine, up to 10 people can meet. If someone does not have the vaccine, only two families can meet.

These rules are in addition to other rules. People without the vaccine cannot go to shops. They also cannot go to restaurants or shows.

A German leader, Mr. Lauterbach, said the rules might need to be stronger. He said the current rules may not stop Omicron cases from growing a lot.

In Belgium, the number of sick people is low. The government changed its mind on Wednesday. They will let theaters and cinemas open again. A court stopped them from closing.

Other countries in Europe are still fighting the Delta type of the virus.

Poland said 794 people died from Covid on Wednesday. This is the most deaths in this wave of the sickness. A health leader in Poland, Waldemar Kraska, said that most of the people who died did not have the vaccine. More than 75% of them were unvaccinated."
30,30_0,0,"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city.","Ukrainian soldiers are fighting to get back the city of Kreminna. Kreminna is in the Luhansk area. Russia controls this city now. There is a lot of fighting in the east and south of Ukraine.

Serhiy Haidai said something about the fighting. He is the governor of the Luhansk area. He said that Russian soldiers had to move back. They moved to a town called Rubizhne. This town is near Kreminna. The Ukrainian army made the Russian soldiers move.

Haidai also said that Kreminna is important for Russia. If Russia loses Kreminna, it will be hard for them to defend the area. The Russian army built strong defenses in Kreminna. They used a lot of soldiers and equipment.

It is hard to know exactly what is happening in the fighting.

If Ukraine gets Kreminna and Svatove back, they can attack other cities. These cities are Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these cities in the summer.

The fighting is very bad. There are no peace talks happening soon.

Sergei Lavrov said something on Monday. He works for Russia. He said that Ukraine must do what Russia wants. Russia wants Ukraine to have less weapons. Russia also wants Ukraine to get rid of Nazis. If Ukraine does not do these things, Russia will win the war.

Lavrov's words show that Russia still wants to change the government in Ukraine. This is even though Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to talk about ending the war.

The British defence ministry said that Russia is trying to take the city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut is in the Donetsk area. Russian soldiers and Wagner fighters are trying to take Bakhmut.

They have been trying to take Bakhmut since July. The fighting has damaged Bakhmut very badly. Both sides call Bakhmut the ""Bakhmut meat-grinder."" This means a lot of people are getting hurt or killed there.

The fight for Bakhmut is important for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He is in charge of the Wagner group. He has hired many prisoners to fight in Bakhmut."
30,30_1,1,"Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory. Since the start of the war, a number of military targets, including oil and weapon depots have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks inside Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as payback.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

Prigozhin has said bad things about the Russian army in Ukraine before. He said Wagner soldiers are the best fighters in Russia.

On Monday, a video was released. People think it was filmed near Bakhmut. It shows two men who seem to be Wagner soldiers. They are saying bad things about Valery Gerasimov. He is a top general in the Russian army. This video makes people think there are problems inside the Russian army.

One of the men in the video said, ""You are like the devil. We have no bullets to fight with.""

The Guardian newspaper could not be sure if the video was real. But when Russian reporters asked Prigozhin about the video, he seemed to agree with what the soldiers did. He said he went to Bakhmut to meet them.

Prigozhin said the soldiers wanted him to tell Gerasimov that it's hard to understand the problems at the front if you are in a warm office. This seemed like he was criticizing the top army leaders.

Last Thursday, Ukraine said Russia moved some planes away from the Engels airfield. Russia said Ukraine attacked the airfield with a drone the day before. Three Russian soldiers died in the attack.

A Ukrainian Air Force spokesman said that after the attack, many planes were moved to other airfields. But some planes are still at the Engels airfield.

In another place, Russia said they killed four Ukrainian soldiers. These soldiers were trying to gather information in the Bryansk region of Russia. This region is near the border with Ukraine.

If this is true, it shows that Ukrainian soldiers are still doing secret missions inside Russia.

Since the war started, some military places inside Russia have been damaged by fire. These places include places where oil and weapons are stored.

Ukraine does not say that they are attacking Russia. But they have been happy when these things happen. They see it as getting revenge."
30,30_2,2,"Also on Tuesday, Putin concluded his two-day “informal summit” in St Petersburg with the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a Moscow-led group consisting of former Soviet states, by gifting the eight leaders present gold rings. The meeting came on the back of growing unease between the Russian president and the rest of the CIS bloc, as nations have sought to distance themselves from Moscow’s faltering war.","On Tuesday, Putin finished his meeting in St Petersburg. The meeting lasted two days. It was a meeting with leaders from the Commonwealth of Independent States. This group is led by Moscow. It includes countries that were once part of the Soviet Union.

Putin gave the eight leaders a gift. The gift was a gold ring.

This meeting happened after some problems. There is worry between Putin and the other CIS countries. These countries want to be separate from Russia's war. Russia's war is not going well."
31,31_0,0,"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce.","Some countries in Europe are getting ready to watch for new types of the coronavirus. These new types could come from China.

China has changed its rules about stopping the virus. Now, Spain and France are making people take tests at airports again.

Spain and France are doing what Italy did. They want people coming from China to show a test that says they do not have the virus. But Spain has an exception. People who have had all their shots do not need a test.

Carolina Darias is the health minister in Spain. She said she wants to change the rules for the EU's digital Covid pass.

There are more people getting sick in China. Some countries do not trust the numbers that China is giving. So, some countries are checking people for Covid again. These countries include the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The UK is also doing this.

The news in China says that asking people from China to take tests is not fair. They say it is because some countries want to make China look bad. They think it is about politics, not health.

But some people in Brussels, Berlin, and Paris say it is important to watch carefully. But they do not think we need to worry too much yet.

Karl Lauterbach is the health minister in Germany. He said it is not necessary to make people take tests if they are coming from China through Germany. Germany is part of the Schengen area, where people can travel without showing passports.

He said that the information from China about the virus is not good enough. So, Germany needs to check for itself. They can check individual flights carefully.

Stella Kyriakides is in charge of health policy for the European Commission. She wants countries in the EU to check the virus more carefully. She wants them to look at the genes of the virus. She also wants them to check the water from airports for the virus. This will help them find any new types of the virus that might come from China.

She wrote a letter to the health ministers of the EU countries. She said they should be very careful when China lets people travel more on January 8. She said that it is hard to get good information about the virus and tests in China."
31,31_1,1,"In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, argued that requiring Covid tests for all passengers from China was “only effective if it is taken at the European level”, noting that many people arrive in Italy on connecting flights through other European countries. After an announcement made by Italy’s health ministry on Thursday, travellers from China are obliged to show a negative test result upon embarking on their flight and to take a second antigen test upon their arrival.","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR B1 level:

Kyriakides wrote a letter. In the letter, she told ministers to check how they study the coronavirus. She said to do this now. Reuters news said this.

Before this, Giorgia Meloni talked about testing people from China. She said everyone from China should have a Covid test. She said this only works if all of Europe does it. She said many people fly to Italy from China through other countries in Europe.

Italy's health ministry said something on Thursday. They said people flying from China must have a negative test. They must show this test before they get on the plane. They must also take another test when they arrive in Italy."
32,32_0,0,"Brazil has been gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepared to both welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons. Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration.","Brazil is getting ready for a very important New Year. It will be a year of big changes for the country.

Brazil will have a new president. And they will say goodbye to a famous person.

Many people will go to Brasilia on January 1st. They will watch Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva become the new president. He will be president for four years.

The next day, football fans will meet in Santos. They will say goodbye to Pelé. Pelé was a very famous football player. He died on Thursday.

Pelé's real name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento. He was 82 years old. He was sick with cancer for more than a year. His body stopped working.

He used to play for Santos and New York Cosmos. He was in the hospital for over a month before he died.

Walter Dias is a journalist. He is 87 years old. He knew Pelé and his family. He said Santos is very sad.

He said Pelé was important to everyone. Pelé made people happy. He was like a family member who died.

Usually, funerals in Brazil happen very quickly. But Pelé's family wants more time. They want all family members to come and say goodbye. It will be an emotional time.

Pelé was married three times. He had seven children. He also had many grandchildren. Some of them live in the United States. Others live in different parts of Brazil. Brazil is a very big country.

Many people are coming to Santos. About two million people live there. Many news reporters from all over the world will also be there.

The old president is Jair Bolsonaro. He is named after a football player. The player's name was Jair da Rosa Pinto.

Jair Bolsonaro will not go to the funeral. He will go to Florida soon. He will not give the president's symbol to the new president.

In his last speech, Bolsonaro talked about Lula's new team. He also talked about a person who supported him. This person tried to blow up a truck with fuel. This happened before the new president's celebration."
32,32_1,1,"That terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia, and the weekend is set to be both tense and festive – but whatever happens could be overshadowed by the following day’s events. Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides.","Brasilia is a bit sad now. There is a problem with terrorists. This weekend will be exciting, but also a bit scary. But something else might be more important.

Lula will become the new leader of Brazil. Many important people from other countries will come. More than 120 countries will send people. But Pelé died. This is very big news all over the world. People are getting ready to say goodbye to him. It is like a funeral for a king.

Presidents, leaders of countries, famous sports people, and his old friends have all sent messages. They are sad about his death. This news came on Thursday. The current leader, Bolsonaro, said that Brazil will have three days of sadness.

Lula, the new leader, said that Pelé made Brazil famous. People from all over the world knew his name. They could all say the word ""Pelé.""

The leader of Santos football club is very sad. Pelé played for Santos. He said people will never forget Pelé. He said that Pelé is not dead. Pelé will live forever in our hearts. Pelé came to Santos as a young boy. He left as a king. People in Santos, Brazil, and all football fans loved him. The leader said, “Rest in peace, Edson. Pelé, please watch over us.”

Santos said Pelé's body is in a hospital in São Paulo. It is called Albert Einstein hospital. On Monday morning, they will take his body to the Santos stadium. The stadium is called Vila Belmiro. It is about 50 miles away.

His body will be in a box. The box will be in the middle of the football field. People can come to the stadium to say goodbye. His body will stay there for 24 hours.

Then, on Tuesday at 10 am, his family will have a private funeral. The cars with his body will drive through the city. They will drive past the house where Pelé's mother lives. She is called Celeste and she is 100 years old."
32,32_2,2,"The former athlete of the century will be laid to rest at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies that claims to be the tallest in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a space on the ninth floor of the building almost two decades ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out. Pelé is loved by people here and by fans of the club because he projected the name of Santos all over the world.”","The famous player Pelé has died. He will be buried in a special place. This place is called Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica. It is a very tall building where people are buried.

This building can hold 18,000 dead people. Some people say it is the tallest building like this in the world.

Pelé picked his spot in the building a long time ago. He chose a place on the ninth floor. He paid for it almost 20 years ago. We know this from the newspaper O Globo.

He wanted to be on the ninth floor because of his father. His father was called Dondinho. Dondinho played football too. He wore the number 9 on his shirt.

From his place, you can see the Vila Belmiro stadium. Pelé liked this place very much. He said it made him feel calm. He also said it did not look like a normal place for dead people.

Someone called Dias talked about the day people will remember Pelé. He said many people will come. The city is getting ready. People will come because they love Pelé. He made the city of Santos famous all over the world. He was loved by the fans of the Santos football club."
33,33_0,0,"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","In 2022, the world had problems. There was Covid and a war in Ukraine. But China was calm at the start of the year.

China had a plan to stop Covid. It was called ""zero-Covid."" It seemed to work, and there were not many Covid cases.

Sometimes, cities had to close. But people followed the rules. China was stable.

Xi Jinping is the leader of China. He wanted to have a third term as leader. This would be a big thing for him. He wanted China to be strong.

He also wanted China to be the most powerful country. He wanted to control Taiwan. He wanted to have more power in the world.

But now, at the end of 2022, things are different. China has new problems.

There are problems with houses and money. There was a problem with Taiwan in August. Some countries are angry about China's human rights. The US is stopping China from making computer chips. China is friends with Russia, but this is difficult.

Xi Jinping became the leader for a third time. But after that, people started to protest. They were very brave. Then, the ""zero-Covid"" plan suddenly ended.

2022 was supposed to be a good year for Xi Jinping. But now he has many worries. He has problems in his country. People are not happy with him.

In October, there was a meeting. It was called the 20th party congress. Xi Jinping got to be leader for five more years. He is now the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

Before, leaders did not want one person to have too much power. But Xi Jinping changed that.

He made his ideas very important. He also removed people who did not agree with him. One person was even taken out of the meeting hall.

Now, Xi Jinping has a lot of power. Some people are worried about what he will do. He is surrounded by people who always agree with him.

A professor named Steve Tsang said that Xi Jinping getting a third term is the biggest thing that happened in China in 2022."
33,33_1,1,"“Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn.","Here's the rewritten text, simplified to CEFR B1 level:

Xi Jinping has a plan for China. He wants China to go in a certain direction. But some people think he is taking China to a new and unknown place.

One big worry is that Xi wants to take over Taiwan. Taiwan is an island near China. Experts do not think this will happen soon.

Last year, China did more military actions near Taiwan than ever before. In August, China said it was ready to use force to take Taiwan.

Nancy Pelosi, a leader from the United States, went to Taiwan. This made China angry. China showed its power by doing more military actions near Taiwan. These actions were very strong.

The United States is important for Taiwan. The US is helping Taiwan more. They might give Taiwan a special status like a friend in NATO. The US will also sell weapons to Taiwan.

Ma Chun-Wei is a professor in Taiwan. He says China cannot fight the US. So, China is doing things to Taiwan and its people.

China might use tricks to confuse people in Taiwan. They might also use computers to attack Taiwan. China could also make it hard for Taiwan to do business. These things could happen before the next election in Taiwan in 2024.

Yun Sun works at a research center in the US. She says China will put more pressure on Taiwan. This will happen if the Democratic Progressive party is in power in Taiwan. This party wants Taiwan to be independent.

On Monday, Taiwan said that many Chinese planes flew near Taiwan. There were 71 planes, including fighter planes and drones. This was the most planes ever seen in one day.

What China is doing to Taiwan is making its relationship with other countries worse.

China is also treating people badly in Hong Kong. They are also hurting people in Xinjiang. The United Nations says this might be a crime against people. This makes the relationship with other countries even worse.

Russia attacked Ukraine. This also made things bad. Xi and Putin, the leader of Russia, said they were good friends. But China did not say that the war in Ukraine was wrong."
33,33_2,2,"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”. Zero-Covid restrictions and the near collapse of the property development sector punished China’s economy this year.","The war in Ukraine is a problem for China's leader, Xi. It makes his position difficult in the world. The war is still happening.

Xi has a friendship with Putin, the leader of Russia. But he does not want problems with other countries. He wants to avoid rules against Russia. China and Russia also compete for power in Asia. They both want to control trade routes.

In March, the US said Putin asked China for weapons. China did not give weapons. But China has helped Russia in other ways. They seem to work together to spread information. They also try to stop other countries from punishing Russia.

Chinese leaders have said they agree with Russia's actions. The armies of China and Russia have practiced fighting together.

Chinese diplomats have also caused problems. In England, some Chinese diplomats hurt a protester. They were sent back to China. This made Xi's relationship with other countries worse.

But Xi cares about relationships with other countries. He started a new term as leader. He has talked to many leaders, like Joe Biden from the US.

One person said Xi wants to make China look better. He wants to change China's image.

Other people are watching to see what happens. They are worried that countries will be nicer to China. They think some countries might stop worrying about human rights in China.

For now, many countries are still strict with China. The US is making new rules about China's technology. Other countries may join these rules. This could make it harder for China's economy to get better.

One expert said these rules could hurt China's economy a lot.

China's economy has had problems this year. Rules about Covid and problems with houses have made things difficult."
33,33_3,3,"To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone. A faltering economy could further provoke domestic frustrations, which peaked in 2022 over the impact of Xi’s signature hardline zero-Covid policy. For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled. With no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel restrictions or mass testing, Covid cases have soared across China. Mass fatalities are predicted, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus.","The Chinese government wants to help with buildings that are not finished. These buildings stopped being built. The government is giving 1.4 trillion yuan (166 billion pounds) to start building again. Experts think this will help builders start working more. They also think it will help China's economy.

But the government has other problems. The ""zero-Covid"" policy caused problems for the economy. Now, the policy is gone, and there will be more sick people. A weak economy could make people angry. In 2022, people were very angry about the zero-Covid policy.

For two years, China had a plan. This plan let people live normally and kept people from dying. But then a new kind of Covid came. It was called Omicron. It made the plan fail. This caused problems for the economy and for people.

People did not like the lockdowns. The lockdowns were sudden and not well done. People started to protest. Some sad things happened, like a bus crash and a fire. These things made people even angrier.

These were the biggest protests in China since 1989. People were mostly angry about the zero-Covid policy. They also complained about not being allowed to say what they thought. Some people were against the leader, Xi.

The protests made some Chinese people see how the government treats other people. These people are minorities or people who disagree with the government. One person, Cohen, said that people now know the government does not always follow its own rules. The government says it wants to follow the rules.

The police stopped the protests quickly. But the protests seemed to work. After one week, the zero-Covid policy ended. Many people thought this policy would last for a long time.

Now, there are no more lockdowns or travel rules. People do not need to stay home if they are sick. There is no more testing. Because of this, many people in China are getting Covid. Experts think many people will die, maybe up to one million."
33,33_4,4,"On Monday, in his first remarks on Covid since the shift in policy, Xi urged officials to take steps to “feasibly protect people’s lives” and said: “We should launch the patriotic health campaign in a more targeted way ... fortify a community line of defence for epidemic prevention and control, and feasibly protect people’s lives, safety and health.” Trivium says what happens next with Covid and Covid policy is “the most important question” politically and economically, for China and Xi in 2023: “It’s not at all clear how this plays out.” The past year has brought far more for China than Xi would have hoped, or analysts expected. Tsang says that, in the end, events have still largely worked out for Xi, even if protests took the shine off his leadership. “He mostly got what he wanted, including not just a third term as top leader but also a leadership filled by his supporters,” says Tsang. “It is less clear that it was equally good for China, as Xi’s amassing of near dictatorial power is costing China dearly.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

**Rewritten Text:**

On Monday, Xi spoke about Covid. It was his first speech since the change in rules. He told people in charge to help people. He said to ""protect people's lives.""

Xi said we need to start a new health plan. This plan should help stop the virus. We need to make our communities safe. We need to protect people's lives, safety, and health.

Trivium said what happens with Covid is very important. It is important for China and for Xi in 2023. It is important for the country and for money. No one knows what will happen next.

The last year was hard for China. It was harder than Xi wanted. It was harder than experts thought.

Tsang said things still worked out for Xi. Even though people protested, he did well.

Tsang said Xi got what he wanted. He is the leader for a third time. His friends are also leaders.

Tsang said this might not be good for China. Xi has a lot of power. This is costing China a lot.

Chi Hui Lin helped with this news."
34,34_0,0,"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","China is getting ready for more COVID-19 cases. This may happen in the countryside in early 2023.

Many cities have lots of people with COVID-19 now. Hospitals are very full.

The Lunar New Year is in late January. It is a very important holiday in China. People can see their families again after a long time. They could not travel easily before because of COVID-19 rules.

Many people will travel home for the holiday. They may bring the virus with them. The countryside does not have as many hospitals as the cities. They also have fewer doctors, medicine, and equipment. It is harder for people in the countryside to get good care.

One person wrote on social media about this. They said that the virus is not fair. Cities and the countryside are not the same. The countryside does not have the same resources to fight the virus. They also do not know as much about health care.

A company called Airfinity thinks the virus will spread to the countryside later in the winter. It could affect even more people than in the cities.

The government has changed how they talk about COVID-19. Before, they said it was very dangerous. Now, they say it is not too bad, like a cold.

The person on social media said that their hometown is talking differently about getting sick. They say that everyone is getting a cold. They say that people do not need to be afraid.

Because of this, the government is not telling people to do things like social distance. Social distancing can help stop the virus from spreading quickly. It can also give hospitals more time to help people.

A professor named Jeremy Wallace is surprised. He said the government is not talking about how bad the situation is. He also said they are not telling people how to slow down the spread of the virus. This would help the hospitals that have too many patients."
34,34_1,1,"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","Here's the text rewritten for a CEFR B1 level:

Many people could die. Experts think the number could be around 1 million. They looked at what happened in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong to guess this.

COVID is spreading fast in some cities. Experts think the number of sick people might soon be as high as it will get. But it is hard to know for sure. China stopped some rules about COVID. They also stopped telling everyone how many people are sick.

China used to be proud of their COVID numbers. But then many people got sick and died. The National Health Commission (NHC) said they would not tell everyone the number of deaths each day anymore.

A news company called AFP said the NHC reported only one death and 5,500 new sick people in one day. This was even though many people said hospitals were full. Airfinity thinks about 9,000 people are dying each day in China. They think this number could be 25,000 each day next month. They think 1.7 million people could die by April.

Jiao Yahui works for the NHC. She said China is not counting all the deaths that other countries would count as COVID deaths. AFP said this. Other countries count any death within 28 days of a positive COVID test. But China only counts deaths from breathing problems caused by the virus.

Jiao said China is using science to decide which deaths are from COVID. She said this is the same as other countries.

China says they are doing a good job dealing with the virus. They used to have strict rules. Now they are letting the virus spread. But social media shows the real situation.

Usually, China stops people from saying bad things about the government online. But now, many posts about COVID in China are online. Charlie Smith works for Greatfire.org. It watches what is allowed online. He said the rules are changing fast. The people who stop bad posts cannot keep up. That is why many posts are still online."
34,34_2,2,"But it also makes sense that the real humans who are behind censorship can see for themselves that current Covid management is all over the place,” he said. “They must be asking themselves how they could possibly censor Covid-related posts when everyone has Covid.”","Here's the rewritten text at a B1 CEFR level:

He also said something important. The people who control what we can see online can see things too. They can see that the rules for Covid are not very clear. Maybe they are thinking about this. They might ask, ""How can we stop people from posting about Covid? Almost everyone has Covid now!"""
35,35_0,0,"Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year amid mounting military tensions with China, the island’s president has announced. Under the plans due to come into effect in 2024, conscripts will undergo more intense training, including shooting exercises and combat instruction used by US forces. Conscripts will be tasked with guarding key infrastructure, enabling regular forces to respond more swiftly in the event of any attempt by China to invade. The announcement of the change came after Taiwan’s defence ministry reported that 71 Chinese air force jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone within 24 hours on Monday – the largest reported incursion to date. “As long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,” President Tsai Ing-wen told a news conference after a national security council meeting. “Taiwan wants to tell the world that between democracy and dictatorship, we firmly believe in democracy. Between war and peace, we insist on peace. Let us show the courage and determination to protect our homeland and defend democracy.” The defence authority also plans to raise the monthly wage of regular conscription soldiers from about NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), almost in line with the minimum wage. Since 2013, Taiwan has required men over 18 to serve four months in the military, with the first five weeks in a basic training boot camp. The new plan will put mandatory recruits on eight-week basic training. Chen Chi-mai, mayor of Kaohsiung city and the acting chairperson of the ruling Democratic Progressive party, told reporters on Tuesday that it was essential to strengthen national security, the official news agency CNA reported. Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China’s growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence. Tsai said “a few things” had been learned from that war which have been incorporated into Taiwan’s defence reforms, and noted that Ukraine’s ability to hold off much larger Russian forces had given the international community time to render assistance.","Taiwan will make changes to its military service. Right now, young men must serve in the military for four months. This will change to one year.

The change is because of problems with China. China and Taiwan have disagreements. Taiwan is worried about a possible attack from China.

This new plan will start in 2024. The soldiers will have harder training. They will learn to shoot better. They will also learn combat skills like soldiers in the United States.

The soldiers will protect important places. This will help the main army be ready if China attacks.

Recently, many Chinese planes flew near Taiwan. The planes were from the Chinese air force. This was the most planes ever seen at one time.

The leader of Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen, spoke about this. She said that if Taiwan is strong, it will protect freedom. She said Taiwan chooses democracy, not dictatorship. Taiwan wants peace, not war. She wants everyone to be brave and protect Taiwan.

The government will also pay the soldiers more money. Now, they get about $211 each month. Soon, they will get about $856 each month. This is close to the lowest salary someone can earn in Taiwan.

Now, new soldiers train for five weeks. With the new plan, they will train for eight weeks.

The mayor of Kaohsiung city said it is important to make Taiwan safer. He said this is because of the problems with China.

Taiwan was changing to a military with only volunteers. But now, because China is stronger, Taiwan needs more soldiers. The war in Ukraine also made Taiwan think about its defense.

President Tsai said Taiwan learned from the war in Ukraine. She said Ukraine was able to fight Russia because other countries helped them. This gave the world time to help."
35,35_1,1,"Previous governments cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to four months to please younger voters during a period of easing tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan’s efforts to bolster the readiness of its defence forces accelerated after the visit to the island from the US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August. China immediately staged military drills around Taiwan in response to Pelosi’s visit. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan welcomed the announcement on conscription reform. “The United States’ commitment to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defence capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,” the American Institute in Taiwan said. A survey conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December found that 73.2% of respondents were in favour of an extension to compulsory service. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the Chinese military threat was “getting more serious than ever”, with a five-fold increase in warplane incursions into the island’s defence zone since 2020. Wu said the drills conducted after Pelosi’s visit were also aimed at scaring off other governments which might support Taiwan. As part of the efforts to ramp up the island’s combat strength, on Friday Tsai inaugurated new military facilities at an army base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, which she said offers “a better living environment” for military personnel, according to a statement released by the president office. Reuters contributed to this report","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR B1 level:

Before, the government made army service shorter. Men had to serve for more than two years. Then, it changed to only four months. This was to make young people happy. At that time, things were more peaceful between Taiwan and China.

But things changed. Nancy Pelosi from the United States visited Taiwan in August. She is important in the US government. After her visit, China was not happy. China did military exercises around Taiwan.

Taiwan wants to be ready to defend itself. So, Taiwan is making its army stronger.

The US office in Taiwan is happy about the new army plan. This office is like an embassy. They said the US supports Taiwan. They said that Taiwan making its army stronger helps keep peace. This peace is important for Taiwan and the area.

In December, people in Taiwan were asked what they thought. Most people, about 73%, wanted the army service to be longer.

Joseph Wu is Taiwan's foreign minister. He said that China is a big threat. He said China's planes fly into Taiwan's air space more often. Since 2020, it has become five times more.

Mr. Wu also said that China's military exercises were meant to scare other countries. China doesn't want other countries to support Taiwan.

Taiwan is trying to make its army stronger. On Friday, Tsai Ing-wen opened new buildings at an army base. Tsai Ing-wen is the president of Taiwan. These new buildings will help the soldiers. They will have a better place to live."
36,36_0,0,"Kherson city was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November. But for some, the horrors of the Russian occupation are still not over. Nadia* sent her 14-year-old son to a Russian-run summer camp in Crimea – occupied by Moscow since 2014 – in October. He was meant to return after two weeks. It has now been more than two months. In late November, he forwarded her a series of chilling voice messages from his camp leader telling him he would not be allowed back to Kherson because of his pro-Ukraine views. “You are in Russia! You shouldn’t be doing different [types] of weird bullshit,” the camp leader in Yevpatoria, Crimea, said in the voice messages, which have been forwarded to the Guardian. “I don’t know who is going to deal with you now, but you are not going back to Kherson, that’s 100% [certain] … You can thank your mother for that.” Like many parents, Nadia did not see sending her child to such a camp – known as summer camps even at other times of year – as making a pro-Russia statement. Parents often decided to send their children because their classmates were going and they were being offered a free holiday by the sea. Nadia’s son left Kherson on 4 October and his stay at the camp was repeatedly extended by the authorities, said his mother, speaking from central Kherson after Russian forces left the city. At first, the camp leaders told her that this was for safety reasons and then, after Ukrainian forces had entered Kherson city, they said he could not return because the city was now “occupied” by Ukraine. In the messages, the camp leader outlined his problem with the boy. Firstly, his Telegram profile picture featured a Ukrainian trident, Ukraine’s national symbol, on the wall in the background. Secondly, his mother had said she wanted her son to return to Ukraine, signifying that she saw Kherson city as part of Ukraine, not Russia, thereby going against the grain of Russian propaganda that still insists the city is part of Russia. Nadia’s case is one of many. Hundreds of Ukrainian children as young as six and as old as 16 from Kherson and Kharkiv regions have been stuck in Russian summer camps for weeks and in some cases months.","Kherson is a city in Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers took back Kherson in November. But some people still have problems from the time when Russian soldiers were there.

Nadia sent her son to a camp in Crimea. He is 14 years old. Crimea is a part of Ukraine, but Russia controls it. This started in 2014.

Nadia's son went to the camp in October. The camp was run by Russians. He was supposed to come back home after two weeks. But now, it has been more than two months.

In November, Nadia got some voice messages from the camp leader. The camp leader said her son could not come back to Kherson. The leader said it was because the boy liked Ukraine.

The camp leader said, ""You are in Russia now! You should not do strange things."" The camp leader was in Yevpatoria, a city in Crimea. He also said, ""I do not know who will deal with you, but you are not going back to Kherson. This is sure. You can thank your mother for this.""

Many parents sent their children to these camps. They did not think it meant they liked Russia. The camps were like summer camps, even when it was not summer. The children went because their friends were going. Also, the trip was free. It was a holiday by the sea.

Nadia's son left Kherson on October 4. The people in charge of the camp kept him there longer and longer. At first, they said it was for safety. Then, Ukrainian soldiers took back Kherson. The camp leaders said he could not go back because Ukraine now ""controlled"" the city.

The camp leader had problems with the boy. One problem was his picture on Telegram. Telegram is a messaging app. His picture showed a Ukrainian symbol. The symbol is called a trident. It was on a wall in the background.

Another problem was that Nadia wanted her son to return to Ukraine. This meant she thought Kherson was part of Ukraine. Russia says Kherson is part of Russia. So, Nadia was against what Russia was saying.

Nadia is not the only one with this problem. Many Ukrainian children are stuck in Russian summer camps. Some are as young as six. Some are 16. They are from Kherson and Kharkiv. They have been in the camps for weeks or months."
36,36_1,1,"Over the summer, Russia offered parents in the occupied areas of Ukraine a chance to send their children to summer camps in Crimea and southern Russia for free. But it has been refusing to return the children to their parents, citing the ongoing fighting as well as Ukraine’s “occupation” of areas Russia claimed to have annexed and has now retreated from. Parents are told they can collect the children if they come in person, which requires them to cross the dangerous unofficial checkpoint through the frontline or leave Ukraine and travel via Poland and the Baltics. But many of the parents are from very low-income backgrounds and have not been able to make the journey. Though the parents sent them willingly, they had agreed to a short stint. The UN convention on children’s rights bans the “illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad”, so Russia is obliged to return the children. The Guardian spoke to eight parents who had sent their children to the summer camps. Some say they believe that Russia wants to use the children to exchange for Russian prisoners of war. Others believe Moscow wants to assimilate the children and plan to keep them in Russia. The camps were advertised through schools in the occupied areas as restorative breaks, offering a mix of sports, arts, games, and sea air or lake swimming. But the children have also been taught Russian narratives about the invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Soviet history as well as Russian culture, according to several interviewed and videos posted online. In one video, hundreds of children can be seen in a school playground in Crimea singing the Russian national anthem. Most appear not to know the words. The hundreds of children stuck in the Russian-run summer camps are in addition to the thousands of children living in orphanages in the occupied areas who were illegally taken to Russia during the Russian occupation. Ukraine’s human right’s ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, has said this is part of Russia’s “genocide against Ukraine”, erasing Ukrainian identity through “re-educating the future generations”. Lubinets said the Russians were not interested in returning the children, and though Ukraine was trying, “the return of each child is like a special operation”. Ukraine asks parents not to publicly name their children as they then become harder to exchange.","In the summer, Russia told parents in Ukraine that their children could go to free summer camps. These camps were in Crimea and in the south of Russia. Crimea is a part of Ukraine that Russia controls.

But now, Russia is not letting the children go back home. They say it is because of the fighting. They also say that Ukraine is taking over areas that Russia used to control.

Parents can get their children back. But they need to go to Russia themselves. This is very hard. They must go through a dangerous checkpoint. Or they must leave Ukraine and travel through other countries.

Many parents do not have enough money to travel. So, they cannot get their children.

The parents let their children go to the camps. But they only agreed to a short trip.

A UN rule says that countries cannot keep children from going back to their homes. So, Russia should send the children back.

The Guardian newspaper talked to eight parents. These parents sent their children to the summer camps.

Some parents think Russia wants to use the children. They think Russia wants to trade the children for Russian soldiers.

Other parents think Russia wants to keep the children. They think Russia wants the children to become Russian.

The summer camps were advertised in schools. The schools were in areas controlled by Russia. The camps promised sports, art, games, and fresh air. Children could swim in the sea or in a lake.

But the children also learned about Russia's ideas about the war in Ukraine. They learned about Russian and Soviet history. They also learned about Russian culture. Some parents and videos online say this is true.

One video shows many children in Crimea. They are singing the Russian national song. Most of them do not know the words.

There are also thousands of children in orphanages. These children were taken to Russia from Ukraine. This happened when Russia controlled those areas.

Dmytro Lubinets works for Ukraine. He protects human rights. He says Russia is trying to destroy Ukrainian people. He says Russia wants to change the children's identity. They want to re-educate them and make them Russian.

Lubinets says Russia does not want to send the children back. Ukraine is trying to get the children back. But it is very difficult. Each child is like a ""special operation"".

Ukraine asks parents not to say their children's names in public. This makes it harder to get the children back."
36,36_2,2,"For a domestic audience, Russia portrays the deportation of the children as an attempt to save Ukrainian children from the war – ignoring Russia’s role in starting the conflict. Since October, the children have started attending Russian schools while living on the camps’ premises. It is not clear what plans Russia has for these children beyond this school term. One of them is Natalia’s* 12-year-old daughter, who left her home in Balakliia in late August and is still in southern Russia, attending a school in Krasnodar by bus. Natalia has managed to keep in daily contact with her but cannot afford to make the journey to collect her. “I think it’s some sort of blackmail,” said Natalia. “I think they want to use them as bargaining chips.” In at least some cases, the Russian camp leaders have said they do not plan to send the children back. In other cases, children have been moved from one camp to another without the parents being informed. Ivana*, a mother from Kherson region, made the long journey to collect her daughter from a camp in Crimea, only to be told the child was not there any more and had been moved to a camp in the Republic of Adygea. She then made a second long trip, where eventually she found her. * * * Exactly how many Ukrainian children remain in Russian hands is very difficult to tell. In mid-October, Russia’s state news agency Tass said there were about 4,500 children from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Crimean summer camps. Natalia said at least 100 of those who travelled with her daughter were still there. Recent videos taken from some of the five camps in Crimea hosting children from Kherson indicate that at least several hundred children are still there. Part of the issue is that many of the parents refuse to come forward to the Ukrainian authorities. Dmytro*, who managed to get his son back by threatening a teacher into putting him on a bus in early October, said parents he knew feared being labelled as collaborators or supporters of Russia. They were trying to resolve things on their own, he said, without official help.","Russia says they took Ukrainian children to help them. They say they wanted to save the children from the war. But Russia started the war. This is not true.

The children now live in camps in Russia. Since October, they go to Russian schools. We do not know what Russia will do with the children after school ends.

Natalia's daughter is 12 years old. She left her home in August. She is in Krasnodar, in the south of Russia. She goes to school there by bus. Natalia talks to her daughter every day. But Natalia does not have enough money to go and get her daughter.

Natalia thinks Russia is using the children. She thinks Russia will use them to get something they want. She thinks it is like blackmail.

Some people in charge of the camps say they will not send the children back. Sometimes, the children are moved to different camps. The parents do not know about this.

Ivana is a mother from Kherson. She went to Crimea to get her daughter. But her daughter was not there. The daughter was moved to another camp in Adygea. Ivana went there and found her daughter.

We do not know how many Ukrainian children are still in Russia. In October, Russia said there were 4,500 children from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in camps in Crimea. Natalia said that many children who went with her daughter are still there.

There are videos from the camps in Crimea. They show many children still there.

Some parents do not want to talk to the Ukrainian government. Dmytro got his son back. He told a teacher to put his son on a bus. He said other parents are afraid. They do not want people to think they support Russia. They want to get their children back without help from the government."
36,36_3,3,"An adviser to the new Kherson regional authorities on missing people, Volodymyr Zhdanov, questioned how the parents “could give their children to the occupiers”, though he admitted it was a grey area and the full picture was unclear. “We are hearing a lot of stories through the grapevine [of children stuck in Crimea],” said Zhdanov, who noted that the gathering of information on what had happened in occupied Kherson was only just beginning. “But the police say parents have not come forward.” Andrii Kovanyi, a spokesperson for Kherson police, said they could not comment on the matter as it was being dealt with by several bodies. Most parents and children who attended the camps said the conditions were good. Children were given the equivalent of hotel rooms to share, taken to see dolphins, to museums and to the beach. The Russian-appointed authorities in Crimea claim to have spent 1.2bn rubles (£16.4m) in 2022 on the camps, which were also attended by Russian children. The idea behind the camps appears to be to demonstrate the best of Russia and to integrate the children into their new state. In interviews, the adults in charge portray themselves and others as saving children who are victims of the war as well as the Ukrainian state. In videos from the children’s camps posted on the Russian-installed Kherson authority’s social media, children can be seen with the Russian flag, singing the Russian national anthem as well as classic Soviet songs. A nine-year-old girl in Kherson city, whose mother collected her in October, said that as well as games and sports they had lectures “about the war”. One history teacher from Kherson, Maksym Ivchenko, who like many other teachers accompanied the children to Crimea, was asked by Russia’s Crimea24 TV to explain how the history curriculum in Russia differed from that of Ukraine. “The most egregious thing was the reversal of modern history. We’re talking first of all about the great patriotic war [the second world war], what happened in the Soviet period, its collapse and everything up until the present day,” Ivchenko said.","Volodymyr Zhdanov helps the new Kherson government. He works with missing people. He asked why parents would send their children to the other side. But he said it is hard to know the whole story.

Zhdanov said they are hearing stories about children in Crimea. He said they are just starting to find out what happened in Kherson. He also said the police said parents have not asked for help.

Andrii Kovanyi works for the Kherson police. He said he cannot talk about this. Many groups are working on it.

Most parents and children who went to the camps said it was good. The children stayed in rooms like hotel rooms. They saw dolphins, museums, and the beach.

The people in charge of Crimea said they spent a lot of money on the camps in 2022. Russian children also went to the camps. The camps wanted to show the best things about Russia. They wanted the children to feel like they belong in Russia.

The adults in charge said they are helping children hurt by the war and Ukraine.

Videos from the camps are on social media. They show children with the Russian flag. They are singing Russian songs. They also sing old Soviet songs.

A girl from Kherson went to a camp. She said they played games and did sports. They also learned about the war. Her mother brought her home in October.

Maksym Ivchenko is a history teacher from Kherson. He went to Crimea with the children. Crimea24 TV asked him how Russian history is different from Ukrainian history.

Ivchenko said the biggest difference was in modern history. He talked about World War II and what happened in the Soviet Union. He also talked about how the Soviet Union ended and everything until now."
36,36_4,4,"Tatiana Makarova, the head of the programme for Kherson and Zaporizhzhia at one the biggest camps in Crimea, Artek, told the same TV channel: “Our task is to remove the psychological pressure put on the children who come from the areas where the war is happening.” Nadia said she and her son had argued at first because she did not want him to go to the camp, but eventually she gave in. “I thought: OK, it’s two weeks, there’s the seaside, he’ll get a rest and come back.” * Names have been changed","Tatiana Makarova works at Artek. Artek is a big camp in Crimea. She is in charge of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia program. She spoke on TV. She said their job is to help children. These children are from places with war. The war makes them feel stressed. They want to take away this stress.

A mother named Nadia talked about her son. She and her son argued. She did not want him to go to the camp. But she changed her mind. She thought it was only two weeks. She thought he could rest by the sea. She hoped he would come back feeling better.

Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has secured the release of 1,456 prisoners of war since Russia invaded in February, according to Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president was speaking in an annual address to the Ukrainian parliament, where Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats, military personnel and family members of fallen soldiers were reportedly present. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine.","It is almost 9 pm in Kyiv. Here is what is happening:

People in Kherson need to leave. Ukrainian leaders are telling them to go. Russian soldiers are attacking Kherson. They are using bombs and big guns. Kherson was taken back by Ukraine not long ago.

Some people in Kherson do not want to leave. They lived there when Russian soldiers controlled the city. A local leader says they don't want to go, even though the city is being bombed.

The Ukrainian army said that Russian soldiers fired 33 rockets at Kherson in one day. They hit places where normal people live. This happened on Wednesday morning.

A hospital in Kherson was hit by Russian bombs on Tuesday night. A part of the hospital for new mothers was damaged. Kyrylo Tymoshenko said this. He works for the President.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that not many people are still in Bakhmut. Bakhmut is a city where there is a lot of fighting. It is in the east of Ukraine, in the Donetsk area.

Zelenskiy said that Bakhmut is full of blood. Ukrainian soldiers are fighting there. The fighting is very hard. This shows how bad the war is.

Ukraine has freed many soldiers who were prisoners. They have freed 1,456 soldiers since Russia attacked in February. Zelenskiy said this.

Zelenskiy spoke to the Ukrainian government. Many important people were there. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi was there. He is the leader of the Ukrainian army. Ministers, diplomats, soldiers, and families of dead soldiers were also there.

Russia said that any plans to stop the war must include some things. They said that four areas of Ukraine are now part of Russia. Russia said these areas belong to them.

Dmitry Peskov spoke for the Russian government. He said that Russia does not agree with Zelenskiy's plan for peace. Zelenskiy's plan has ten parts. It includes Ukraine getting its land back, Russian soldiers leaving, prisoners being freed, and a court for the people who started the war. It also includes promises that Ukraine will be safe."

A person who helps people in Crimea has been put in prison for seven years. Crimea is a place that Russia took from Ukraine. A court in Crimea said she had a bomb. But other people who help people say this is not true. They say the trial was not fair. Her name is Iryna Danilovich. She will be in a prison in Crimea.

The city of Odesa in Ukraine is taking down a statue. The statue is of Catherine the Great. She was a Russian queen who started the city a long time ago. The local leaders voted to take down the statue. They will also take down a statue of a Russian general.

Russian soldiers are going to fight in Ukraine. They can keep their sperm frozen for free. This is because Russia is worried that not enough babies are being born. The war in Ukraine might make this problem worse.

The United Nations is counting how many people have died in the war in Ukraine. They say that about 6,884 people have died. This includes 429 children. This is from February 24, 2022, to December 26, 2022. But the real number of people who died is probably higher.

Thank you for reading this news.

**Hospital Attack**

There was an attack. Windows broke. Staff and patients had to hide in the basement. One staff member spoke to reporters. She said she did not want to think about what could have happened. Surgeons were working in the operating room only 30 minutes before the attack.

**Igor's Journey**

Igor Pedin is 61 years old. He survived. He said his secret was to not be seen. He was invisible. He used to be a cook on a ship. He had a dog named Zhu-Zhu. He thought the Russian soldiers would not see him. He thought they would not see his dog. He walked 140 miles. He started his trip on April 23. He left his home in Mariupol. Mariupol is a Ukrainian city that was under attack. He walked through dangerous areas. These areas were controlled by Russia. He wanted to get to Zaporizhzhia. Zaporizhzhia was a safer city.

It was very dangerous. Soldiers stopped Igor at a checkpoint. They asked him to go back. But they also gave him cigarettes for good luck. He lived. It was surprising. Now, his story is famous. People know about him. He is not invisible anymore.

**Kherson Evacuation**

Ukrainian leaders want people to leave Kherson. Russian soldiers are attacking the city. They are using mortars and artillery. Kherson was recently freed from Russian control. Some people lived through the Russian time in Kherson. They do not want to leave. Even though the city is being bombed, they want to stay.

Dmytro Poddubniy works for the Kherson city council. He told CNN that Kherson is very dangerous now. He tells people to think of leaving as a vacation for two weeks. He hopes this will help them decide to leave. But many people are still staying.

Inna Balyoha lives in Kherson. She told the news that she is afraid. Her mother is old and sick. She does not think her mother can travel far. She said her mother is very weak. She thinks her mother will not make it to another city. Many people stay in Kherson because of their parents.

Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. The Crimean human rights activist, nurse and citizen journalist was detained by Russian authorities in late April while on her way from work. Her family told CNN at the time balaclava-clad officials from the Russian special police unit searched her house in the village of Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya, and took the family’s laptops and phones. Her case was part of a string of disappearances of activists, journalists and ordinary citizens reported over the last decade in Russian-occupied Crimea. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) called on Russian authorities in Crimea to disclose any information concerning Danilovich’s whereabouts when she first went missing. In a statement, Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator, said: Iryna Danilovich’s alarming disappearance prompts fears of yet another clampdown on independent reporting in Russian-occupied Crimea, which is already an extremely restrictive environment for the press. Russia’s security service (FSB) accused Danilovich of making an explosive device and keeping it on her person, IMI said. She was also fined 50,000 rubles (£570) on the charges of illegal storage and manufacture of explosives under Part 1 of Art. 222.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, it said. Volodymyr Chekryhin, deputy head of the Crimean Human Rights Group, said that the case against Danylovich was grossly falsified, starting with Russian FSB officers effectively kidnapping her.","A woman who fights for human rights in Crimea is going to prison. She will be in prison for seven years.

A court in Crimea said she had an explosive. Crimea is now controlled by Russia. Many people who fight for human rights say the court case was not fair. They say it was made up.

The woman's name is Iryna Danilovich. She was sentenced by a court in Feodosia, Crimea. Russia took Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. This information comes from an organization called Institute of Mass Information (IMI).

Iryna is a nurse and a journalist. She was stopped by Russian police in April. She was going home from work.

Her family told CNN what happened. They said that police officers with masks searched her house. The police took computers and phones. This happened in Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya.

Many activists, journalists, and normal people have disappeared in Crimea. This has happened in the last ten years since Russia took control.

An organization that protects journalists, CJP, asked Russia to tell them where Iryna was when she disappeared.

Gulnoza Said from CJP said she is worried. She thinks this is another way to stop journalists from reporting in Crimea. It is already very hard for journalists there.

Russia says that Iryna made an explosive device. They say she had it with her. She also has to pay 50,000 rubles. This is about £570. They say she broke the law by having explosives.

There is no hour when the terrible roar of artillery does not sound.","Some experts who study populations say that Russia has a problem. The war in Ukraine may make this problem worse. Vladimir Putin, the leader of Russia, has ordered some people to join the army. This is called ""partial"" military mobilisation.

An Australian woman’s son died in Ukraine. He was fighting in the war. The woman said her son was a good person. He wanted to help people and protect freedom. The Australian government has said that his name was Sage O’Donnell. He was from Melbourne.

The United Nations is keeping track of people who have died in the war. They say that 6,884 people have died in Ukraine. This includes 429 children. These deaths happened between February 24, 2022, and December 26, 2022. The United Nations thinks that more people have died than they know about.

Vladimir Putin has made a new rule. Russia will not sell oil to countries that have a price limit. This rule starts on February 1, 2023, and lasts for five months. Some powerful countries like the G7, the European Union, and Australia agreed on a price limit for Russian oil. The limit is $60 per barrel. This started on December 5.

Hello, this is Léonie Chao-Fong from London. I am still here to tell you the latest news from Ukraine. You can contact me on Twitter or by email.

The defence ministers of Russia, Turkey, and Syria talked in Moscow today. Russian news said that they talked about how to fix the problems in Syria. They also talked about refugees and fighting bad groups in Syria.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that only a few people are still living in Bakhmut. Bakhmut is a city in the east of Ukraine. It is a dangerous place because of the war. Zelenskiy said that the city is covered in blood. Ukrainian soldiers are fighting there. This fight shows how terrible the war is.

Zelenskiy said that 70,000 people lived in Bakhmut last year. Now, only a few people are left. He said that there is blood everywhere. He also said that there are loud noises from the war all the time."
37,37_7,7,"Still, Bakhmut stands. Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of 70,000-80,000, is a ghost town now largely in ruins. The deterioration of diplomatic relations between Russia and Lithuania has continued, with the expulsion today of a Lithuanian from their embassy in Moscow. A statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: On 28 December, Chargé d’Affaires of Lithuania in Russia, Jurgita Cibulskiene was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Lithuanian side was strongly protested in connection with the unjustified expulsion on 1 December this year [of an] employee of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. As a response, one of the diplomats of the Lithuanian embassy was declared “persona non grata”, and must leave the territory of the Russian Federation within five days. Reuters reported that ship insurers have said they are cancelling war risk cover across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, after an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses. Reinsurers, which insure the insurers, typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on 1 January, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started. The moves by the insurers will make it harder for ship-owners or charterers to find insurance, increase prices and may mean some ships sail uninsured, industry sources said. Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, has tweeted images of a maternity hospital in Kherson city that was shelled by Russian forces yesterday. According to Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Two babies were born at the hospital the day of the attack, Liashko wrote on his Facebook, adding that one arrived just “minutes” before the shelling. He added: Fortunately, no babies ... no hospital staff were hurt this time. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. The European Commission says it is donating €14m (£12.3m) to buy and transport school buses for Ukraine, as well as an additional 120 buses “to bring Ukrainian children safely to school”.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

**Bakhmut**

Bakhmut is still there. Before the war, about 70,000 to 80,000 people lived there. Now, Bakhmut is almost empty and broken.

**Russia and Lithuania**

The relationship between Russia and Lithuania is getting worse. Russia asked a Lithuanian person to leave the Russian embassy in Moscow today.

Russia said that on December 28, they talked to Jurgita Cibulskiene from the Lithuanian embassy. Russia was angry because Lithuania asked a Russian person to leave the Russian embassy in Vilnius on December 1.

Because of this, Russia is asking a Lithuanian diplomat to leave Russia. The diplomat has five days to leave. Russia says the diplomat is ""persona non grata."" This means they are not welcome.

**Ship Insurance**

Some companies that give insurance to ships are stopping their insurance in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. These companies are losing a lot of money.

Companies that insure the insurance companies are also leaving. They will not renew their contracts after January 1.

This means it will be harder for ships to find insurance. The price of insurance will also go up. Some ships might sail without any insurance.

**Hospital in Kherson**

Emine Dzheppar, a government worker in Ukraine, showed pictures of a hospital in Kherson. Russian soldiers attacked the hospital yesterday with bombs.

Viktor Liashko, who is in charge of health in Ukraine, said the hospital was bombed just after a baby was born. He said two babies were born that day. One baby was born just before the bombing.

He said that no babies or doctors were hurt. We cannot be sure if this is true.

**School Buses for Ukraine**

The European Commission is giving money to Ukraine. They will give 14 million euros to buy buses. They will also give 120 more buses. These buses will help Ukrainian children go to school safely."
37,37_8,8,"About 5.7 million school-age children in Ukraine have been affected by Russia’s war, which has also led to thousands of schools and educational facilities damaged or destroyed, the Commission said. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. The monument was first erected in 1900 but was dismantled in 1920 after the Bolshevik takeover. It was restored and reopened in 2007. After the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukraine’s parliament passed a “decommunisation” law that meant statues to Lenin and other Soviet political figures had to be removed (or, in the case of Odesa’s Lenin statue, reworked and reimagined as a statue to Darth Vader). Since Russia’s February invasion, however, many in Ukraine have sought a more overarching reevaluation of anything Russian, and the monument to Catherine had been daubed with red paint several times. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Authorities plan to store the monuments in a museum in the city. France’s armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has tweeted a photo of him visiting a memorial to the war dead in Kyiv as part of his visit to Ukraine. Lecornu, who is on his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May, is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army officials. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, has struck a cautious tone on whether his country would supply Ukraine with air defence systems. Speaking in an interview with Il Messaggero newspaper, Crosetto said the air defence systems, which Ukraine’s president has requested, would be provided to Kyiv “if possible”. He added: If we give air defence missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality.","Here is the rewritten text in CEFR B1 level English:

The war in Ukraine is affecting many children. About 5.7 million children of school age are having problems because of the war. Many schools are damaged or destroyed.

The city of Odesa is taking down a statue. The statue is of Catherine the Great. She was a Russian leader who started the city long ago. The statue was first put up in 1900. Then, it was taken down in 1920. Later, it was put back up in 2007.

Ukraine had a revolution in 2014. After that, they made a new law. This law said that statues of Lenin and other Soviet people must be taken away. One statue of Lenin in Odesa was changed to look like Darth Vader.

Now, after Russia invaded in February, many people in Ukraine want to remove anything that is Russian. The statue of Catherine the Great had red paint on it many times. Last month, the city voted to take down the statue. They will also take down a statue of Alexander Suvorov. He was a general. The city will keep the statues in a museum.

The minister of armed forces from France, Sébastien Lecornu, went to Ukraine. He visited a place that remembers people who died in the war in Kyiv. He will meet with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He will also meet with the defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army leaders.

The defence minister from Italy, Guido Crosetto, is being careful about giving Ukraine air defence systems. Ukraine wants these systems. The Italian minister said they will give them ""if possible"". He said if they give missiles to Ukraine, they must take them from their own supply. They need to be sure they still have enough for themselves and that the missiles are good."
37,37_9,9,"Crosetto’s comments came after Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke with Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Tuesday. In a tweet posted after the call, Ukraine’s leader said Meloni informed him that “the issue of providing air defence systems to protect Ukrainian skies is being considered”. A Swiss court has granted a six-month “stay of bankruptcy” to the company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was built to bring Russian gas to Germany but never opened after Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, a Swiss-based company owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom, built the gas pipeline but the project was halted in early February after Moscow formally recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. The company’s stay has now been extended to 10 July by a Swiss regional, Reuters cited a notice published in the Swiss official gazette of commerce as saying. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. The Russian Union of Lawyers head, Igor Trunov, told the state-owned news agency Tass the health ministry had agreed to his appeal to offer free cryobank services to the 300,000 soldiers conscripted in September. According to the lawyer, his organisation has already been contacted by several couples whose husbands will soon depart for Ukraine. The health ministry has not yet commented on Trunov’s remarks. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. Russia’s population has been in near-constant decline for decades. The coronavirus pandemic led to the country’s largest natural population decline since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The war in Ukraine, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of young Russian men while also sparking an unprecedented exodus of educated professionals, is expected to hasten the demographic crash for Russia. The independent demographer Alexei Raksha has described the current demographic situation as “the perfect storm”. Earlier we reported air raid alerts blared across Ukraine, including in Kyiv and Mykolaiv.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR B1 level:

Volodymyr Zelenskiy talked to Giorgia Meloni on Tuesday. She is the Prime Minister of Italy. After the talk, Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter. He said Meloni told him Italy is thinking about giving Ukraine air defense systems. These systems can help protect Ukraine from air attacks.

A court in Switzerland made a decision. The decision helps the company that built Nord Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 is a pipeline. It was built to send gas from Russia to Germany. But it never opened. This is because Vladimir Putin sent soldiers to Ukraine.

The company that built the pipeline is called Nord Stream 2 AG. It is in Switzerland. It belongs to Gazprom. Gazprom is a big Russian gas company. The project stopped in February. This happened after Russia said two parts of Ukraine were independent.

Now, the court has given the company more time. They have until July 10. This information was in a Swiss paper. Reuters news agency reported this.

Russian soldiers are going to fight in Ukraine. They can keep their sperm frozen for free. This will be in a special bank called a cryobank. A Russian lawyer said this.

The lawyer is Igor Trunov. He leads the Russian Union of Lawyers. He said the health ministry agreed. Soldiers can use the cryobank for free. 300,000 soldiers were asked to join the army in September.

The lawyer said many couples have asked him about this. Their husbands are going to Ukraine soon. The health ministry has not said anything about this yet.

Experts say there is a problem with the number of people in Russia. Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine can make this worse. Russia has had fewer people for many years.

The coronavirus made the problem bigger. It was the biggest drop in population since 1991.

The war in Ukraine is also a problem. Many young Russian men have died. Also, many educated people have left Russia. This will make the population problem worse.

Alexei Raksha is an expert on population. He said the situation is very bad.

Earlier, we said there were air raid alarms in Ukraine. This included the cities of Kyiv and Mykolaiv."
37,37_10,10,"Officials have sounded the all-clear almost two hours later. There were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes. Ukrainian social media suggested the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off. Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine, forcing hundreds of civilians to flee the recently liberated city amid relentless shelling by Moscow’s troops. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said this morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in the city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added. At least 10 people were killed and 58 were wounded by a Russian strike in Kherson on Saturday, authorities said. Russian forces were forced to withdraw from Kherson city last month, but its residents have faced relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnieper River. About 400 people have fled Kherson since Christmas Day, the BBC reported, after a sharp increase in the intensity of the Russian bombardment of the city. The Kremlin has dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, and insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account today’s realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia. Plans that do not take these realities into account cannot be peaceful. Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk – in September after holding Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions. Kyiv and its western allies have said they would never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine’s territory.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

The alert is over now. It finished about two hours later. There are no reports of new missile attacks from Russia.

People in Ukraine thought the alert started because Russian planes in Belarus took off.

Russian soldiers are attacking the city of Kherson with guns and bombs. Many people are leaving the city. They are escaping the attacks. Kherson was freed from Russian control recently. But Russia is still shooting at the city.

The Ukrainian army said that Russia shot 33 rockets at Kherson in one day. The rockets hit places where normal people live.

On Tuesday, a part of a hospital in Kherson was hit by Russian bombs. This part was for mothers and babies. Kyrylo Tymoshenko said this. He works for the President. Nobody was hurt. The people in the hospital went to a safe place.

On Saturday, ten people died in Kherson because of a Russian attack. 58 people were hurt.

Russian soldiers left Kherson last month. But they are still shooting at the city from the other side of the river. The river is called the Dnieper River.

About 400 people have left Kherson since Christmas. The attacks from Russia have become stronger.

The Russian government does not like the peace plan from President Zelenskiy. He is the leader of Ukraine. Russia says that any peace plan must accept that four Ukrainian areas now belong to Russia.

Dmitry Peskov spoke for the Russian government. He said that a peace plan must accept that four regions are now part of Russia. He said that plans which do not accept this, cannot be peaceful.

Russia took control of four Ukrainian areas in September. These areas are Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk. Russia held fake votes there. Kyiv and other countries say they will never agree that these areas belong to Russia. Russia does not control all of these areas completely."
37,37_11,11,"President Zelenskiy has been promoting his 10-point peace plan, first announced in November, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskiy’s foreign minister, Dmtryo Kuleba, said on Monday that Ukraine was aiming to hold a peace summit by the end of February – preferably at the UN with its secretary general, António Guterres, as a possible mediator.

It is his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May 2022. France24 reporter Andrew Hilliar has said Lecornu is expected to visit a memorial to the war dead today, and that the trip comes on the back of the promise by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to increase his nation’s military support for Ukraine. Hilliar reports that Lecornu is under pressure to announce further assistance, with some in Ukraine still angry at Macron’s comments during the course of the war, where he has seemed more vocal than most European leaders to suggest that Ukraine should be prepared to make concessions in return for peace. Reuters reports that one of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head ofRussia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed “official” in the occupied region. In a picture published by Rogov on Telegram, Kiriyenko was seen outside the plant.","President Zelenskiy has a plan for peace. He told people about it in November.
The plan has ten parts.
One part is about Ukraine getting back all its land.

37,37_12,12,"The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has tweeted to reiterate the support the US is providing to keep energy systems running in Ukraine, following Russia’s sustained attacks on the energy infrastructure that civilians rely on. The ambassador said the embassy in Kyiv is “proud to carry out the secretary of state’s mission to work day and night with Ukrainian partners to help keep the energy grid up and running through the winter. We stand with Ukraine.” Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. Associated Press reports that in an interview with the minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian official said: The next stage, now that we are more or less equipped with reconnaissance drones, is strike drones. These are both exploding drones and drones that fly up to 3 to 10km and hit targets. I can say already that the situation regarding drones will change drastically in February or March. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. In the last few moments, authorities in Kyiv and Mykolaiv have declared air raid alerts, according to posts on Telegram. The state-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting that Russian authorities claim to have thwarted a Ukrainian-sponsored terrorist attack in Chegem in the Kabardino-Balkarian republic, which is near Russia’s border with Georgia. It reports: The federal security service stopped the activities of two previously convicted Russian citizens who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services, were preparing a terrorist act in the city of Chegem. After committing the crime, they planned to leave for Ukraine to take part in hostilities against the Russian armed forces. At the scene of the clash, they found an improvised explosive device with a capacity of about 2kg in TNT equivalent, an AK-74 assault rifle, a pistol and ammunition. The report states that the two suspects were killed. No evidence was offered for the claims of the Russian security services.","The US ambassador in Ukraine is Bridget Brink. She wrote on Twitter that the US helps Ukraine. The US wants to help Ukraine keep its energy systems working. Russia has been attacking Ukraine's energy systems for a long time. People need these systems to live.

The ambassador said the US embassy in Kyiv is happy to help. They are working hard with Ukrainians to keep the power on during winter. The US supports Ukraine.

Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones. Most of these drones are for finding information. Ukraine plans to make drones that can fight. These drones will be able to attack like the exploding drones Russia is using.

A Ukrainian government minister talked about this. His name is Mykhailo Fedorov. He said Ukraine is ready to make attack drones. Some drones will explode. Other drones will fly far and hit targets. He thinks the drone situation will change a lot soon.

Ukraine has not said much about explosions inside Russia. Some people think these explosions are from Ukrainian military actions or drones.

Now, there are air raid alerts in Kyiv and Mykolaiv. This information is on Telegram.

Russian news agency Tass says something different. They say Russia stopped a terrorist attack in Chegem. Chegem is near Russia's border with Georgia.

Russia says two people were planning the attack for Ukraine. Russia says these people wanted to go to Ukraine and fight against the Russian army after the attack.

Russia says they found bombs, guns, and bullets. They say the two people were killed. Russia did not show any proof of these claims."

The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. His mother, in a statement released via Dfat, said her son had fallen in love with Ukraine and was “humbled by the kindness and hospitality within his new community”. “Sage died in action defending the freedom of the Ukrainian people,” she said. “Sage has always believed in defending country, people and the right for freedom.” She said her son upheld his values as he served in Australia and abroad in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and described her son as driven by “empathy for the Ukrainian people” at the “injustice that has taken place”.

**An Australian Man Dies in Ukraine**

Adeshola Ore and Amy Remeikis write for the Guardian newspaper. They say a mother is sad because her son died. Her son was from Australia. He was fighting in Ukraine.

The mother said her son wanted to protect freedom. He cared about other people.

The Australian government said on Wednesday that the man, Sage O’Donnell, had died. He was from Melbourne.

His mother said her son loved Ukraine. She said he liked the people there. They were very kind to him.

She said Sage died while fighting for the freedom of Ukraine. He always wanted to protect countries, people, and freedom.

He fought for what he believed in. He helped in Australia and in Ukraine. He felt sorry for the people in Ukraine because what happened to them was not fair.

The mother's name was not in the news. She said her family is very sad. They will remember Sage's funny jokes, kind heart, and happy laugh.

**Fighting Continues in Ukraine**

Oleh Synyehubov is the governor of Kharkiv. Kharkiv is a region in Ukraine. It is next to Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia says that Luhansk and Donetsk now belong to Russia.

Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram that someone got hurt. Telegram is like a phone app for messages. He said one person was hurt by the enemy.

He said a man, 48 years old, was hurt in the morning. Kharkiv was attacked. He is in the hospital. He is okay, but not great. It is not known if this is true.

A Telegram channel from Donetsk said something too. Donetsk is an area in Ukraine that Russia says belongs to them.

The channel said that Ukrainian soldiers shot at seven towns in the last day. These towns are in Donetsk. The channel also said one person was hurt. Two houses and three buildings were damaged. It is not known if this is true."

The European Union delegation to Ukraine has announced that it will support “more than 700,000 Ukrainians in the winter” during the war. In a press statement released on Wednesday, the office of the international organisation for migration (IOM) in Ukraine says it is “stepping up efforts to help internally displaced and war-affected people survive the cold weather”. The statement claims that: IOM’s winter preparedness support, made possible by EU funding, includes repairs to collective centres for displaced people, improvements to water, drainage and heating systems, repairs to damaged houses, and the provision of warm blankets, bedding, mattresses and hygiene items. The programme also provides solid fuel and cash assistance to help people have flexible winter livelihoods. This funding will also enable IOM to ensure the availability of critical assets to ensure that aid continues to reach war-affected populations, and to support partner organisations responding to urgent needs on the ground. Claudia Amaral, head of the European Commission’s directorate-general for civil protection and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, is quoted as saying: Vulnerable sections of the population of Ukraine are going through the hardest winter. As the attacks continue, leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating and water, our humanitarian partners, including IOM, continue to work to meet the most urgent needs. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv region in Ukraine’s west, has posted to Telegram to say that it was quiet overnight in the region. He said there was one air alert yesterday, a warning of cruise missiles being fired from Belarus in the north, but that the danger “did not materialise”. The official Telegram channel of the Kyiv city state administration has posted to say that there are air raid warnings in effect in Ukraine’s capital. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Russian forces have fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in the Ukrainian city of Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said on Telegram.","Only a few countries said the DPR was okay before. Russia, Syria, and North Korea were those countries. The DPR is a place. Now, the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin, says the DPR is part of Russia.

The European Union is helping Ukraine. Ukraine is at war. The EU will help over 700,000 Ukrainians this winter.

The IOM is an organisation that helps people. They are helping people who had to leave their homes in Ukraine because of the war. They want to help them stay warm this winter.

The IOM will fix buildings where people are staying. They will fix water, pipes, and heating. They will fix houses that are broken. They will give people blankets, beds, and soap. The EU is paying for this.

They will also give people fuel to burn and money. This will help them earn a living during the winter. The IOM will also make sure they can still give help to people during the war. They will help other groups that are helping people too.

Claudia Amaral works for the European Commission. She said that this winter is very hard for some people in Ukraine. She said many people do not have power, heat, or water. The IOM and other groups are helping them get what they need.

Maksym Kozytskyi is the governor of Lviv. Lviv is a place in Ukraine. He said that last night was quiet. He said there was a warning about missiles from Belarus. But the missiles did not come.

Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine. The Kyiv city government said there are air raid warnings now. This means that people should be careful because of possible attacks.

37,37_15,15,"Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says that fighting has intensified, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines. Russian troops who have been part of a mobilisation drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, the state TASS agency reported on Wednesday. Citing Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan. The ministry “determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilised to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024”, Trunov was quoted as saying. Families can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so. More on Russia’s response to the oil price cap, via Reuters: Under the cap, oil traders who want to retain access to Western financing for such crucial aspects of global shipping as insurance must promise not to pay above $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil. That is close to the current price for Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia was able to sell it for much of the past year, when windfall energy profits helped Moscow offset the impact of financial sanctions. The decree from Putin, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to “actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them”. The Kremlin ban would halt crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from 1 February to 1 July 2023. A separate ban on refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel would take effect on a date to be set by the government. Putin would have authority to overrule the measures in special cases. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and any actual disruption to its sales would have far-reaching consequences for global energy supplies. Russia retaliated on Tuesday against a price cap on its oil imposed by Western countries, while its forces were involved in heavy fighting around the bombed-out ghost town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.","Here is the rewritten text, suitable for CEFR B1 level:

Fighting in Ukraine is getting worse.
Oleh Zhdanov, a military expert from Ukraine, said that there are more tanks and army vehicles.
Russia is sending more of these to the war.

Russian soldiers are going to fight in Ukraine.
These soldiers can now freeze their sperm for free.
This will be in special banks called cryobanks.
The Russian news agency TASS said this on Wednesday.

Igor Trunov is the head of a group of Russian lawyers.
He asked the government for money to help.
TASS said that the Health Ministry agreed to the plan.
The ministry will pay for keeping the sperm safe.
This is for soldiers fighting in the war from 2022 to 2024.
Families can also use the sperm for free.
They need to have the right medical insurance.

Some countries put a limit on the price of Russian oil.
Oil sellers must promise to not pay more than $60 for one barrel of Russian oil.
If they do, they can use Western money for important things like ship insurance.
The price of Russian oil now is near $60.
But Russia used to sell oil for a much higher price.
This made Russia a lot of money.
This money helped Russia deal with other problems.

Putin made a new rule because of the oil price limit.
He said it was because some countries are being unfriendly.
He said they are going against international rules.
These countries are the United States and others.

Russia will stop selling oil to countries that use the price limit.
This will start on February 1st and end on July 1st, 2023.
There will also be a ban on selling gasoline and diesel.
The government will decide when this starts.
Putin can change these rules in special cases.

Russia sells more oil than any country except Saudi Arabia.
If Russia stops selling oil, it will cause big problems.
It will change the world's energy supply.

Western countries put a price limit on Russian oil.
Russia is fighting back because of this.
There is also a lot of fighting in Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine.
The city is almost destroyed."
37,37_16,16,"Despite an intensification in the fighting the frontline in eastern Ukraine remains little changed, with neither side making any major advances, said Britain’s Ministry of Defence and Ukraine military analysts. Moscow will ban oil sales to countries that abide by the price cap that was imposed on 5 December, President Vladimir Putin decreed. The price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Moscow’s military efforts in Ukraine - without upsetting markets by actually blocking Russian supply. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The agency says the actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. The UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) says that since the start of the war, at least 6,884 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, including 429 children. However, the agency believes that the actual figures are “considerably higher”. We’ll have more on this story shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure.","The fighting in eastern Ukraine is still strong. But the line where the fighting is happening has not moved much. Neither side has made big steps forward. This information comes from the British Ministry of Defence and experts in Ukraine.

Russia will stop selling oil to countries. These countries agreed to a price limit on Russian oil. This limit started on December 5th. President Vladimir Putin made this decision.

The price limit is new. It did not happen even when the West and the Soviet Union were in the Cold War. The price limit is meant to hurt Russia's military actions in Ukraine. But it also wants to keep the oil market stable by not stopping Russian oil completely.

The United Nations has counted how many normal people have died in the war in Ukraine. They say that 6,884 people have died. This includes 429 children. These deaths happened between February 24, 2022, and December 26, 2022.

The United Nations thinks the real number of deaths is higher. It is hard to get information from places where there is a lot of fighting. Some reports need to be checked.

Hello and welcome. We will give you updates on the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan.

The UN says that at least 6,884 normal people have been killed in Ukraine since the war started. This includes 429 children. But the UN believes the number is much higher. We will talk more about this soon.

Here are some important things that have happened recently:

Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a paper. This paper says that Russia will not sell oil to countries that use the price limit. This will start on February 1, 2023, and last for five months.

The Group of Seven countries, the European Union, and Australia made an agreement this month. They agreed to a price limit of $60 for each barrel of Russian oil that is shipped by sea. This started on December 5th.

Ukrainian soldiers seem to be getting closer to taking back the city of Kreminna. This city is in the Luhansk area and is controlled by Russia. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said that Russian soldiers in Kreminna had to move back to Rubizhne. Rubizhne is a town a few miles to the south-east. They moved because the Ukrainian army was putting pressure on them."
37,37_17,17,"Heavy fighting continues in the east and south of the country amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, Britain’s defence ministry said in its daily military briefing on Tuesday. Russia’s military has moved many of its warplanes from Engels airbase to other locations after strikes on the crucial airbase, according to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force. Three Russian servicemen were killed on Monday after a Ukrainian drone attack on the airbase, which lies deep inside Russian territory, according to Russia’s defence ministry. Putin’s comments that he was “ready to negotiate with all parties” involved in the conflict in Ukraine are part of a deliberate information campaign aimed at misleading the west into making concessions, according to analysts. The US thinktank Institute for the Study of War said the Russian president did not offer to negotiate with Ukraine on Saturday, contrary to some reporting. The bodies of 42 Ukrainian servicemen who died while fighting have been returned to Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. Work on bringing back the bodies of Ukraine’s fighters “does not stop for a day”, Oleh Kotenko, the commissioner for missing persons, said. Vladimir Putin met his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, twice in the past 24 hours to “finalise many issues”, Belarusian state-owned Belta news agency reported. The meetings took place in St Petersburg, over breakfast on Tuesday at the Russian Museum, as well as at an informal summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) yesterday evening, it reported. A Russian sausage tycoon who reportedly criticised the war in Ukraine has died after falling from the third-floor window of a luxury hotel in India. The body of Pavel Antov, 65, was discovered just two days after his friend and another local Russian politician, Vladimir Bidenov, was found dead in the same hotel after an apparent heart attack.","There is a lot of fighting in the east and south of Ukraine. It does not look like peace talks will start soon.

If Ukraine can take back Kreminna and Svatove, they could attack Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these cities in the summer. The Guardian newspaper could not check these reports about the fighting.

Britain's defence ministry said that Russian soldiers are trying to take the city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut is in the Donetsk area.

Ukraine said that Russia moved many planes from Engels airbase. This happened after the airbase was attacked.

Russia said that three of their soldiers died on Monday. A Ukrainian drone attacked the Engels airbase. The airbase is far inside Russia.

Putin said he wants to talk to all sides in the war. Experts say this is to trick the West. He wants the West to give in to Russia. The US thinktank Institute for the Study of War said Putin did not offer to talk to Ukraine on Saturday. Some news stories said he did, but this is not true.

Ukraine said that they have received the bodies of 42 Ukrainian soldiers. These soldiers died in the fighting. Oleh Kotenko said that they are always working to bring back the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers who are missing.

Vladimir Putin met with Alexander Lukashenko from Belarus two times in the last day. They wanted to talk about many things. The Belta news agency in Belarus said this. The meetings were in St Petersburg. They had breakfast together at the Russian Museum on Tuesday. They also met at a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) last night.

A rich Russian man who sold sausages has died in India. He fell from a window on the third floor of a fancy hotel. His name was Pavel Antov, and he was 65 years old. Two days before, his friend Vladimir Bidenov died in the same hotel. It looked like he had a heart attack. Some news stories say Pavel Antov did not like the war in Ukraine."
38,38_0,0,"Pope Benedict XVI, who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, died on Saturday aged 95, three days after his successor, Pope Francis, warned the world that he was gravely ill. The Vatican announced that Francis would preside at Benedict’s funeral in St Peter’s Square on Thursday. From Monday, his body will lie at St Peter’s Basilica to allow the faithful to pay respects. Benedict’s death brings to a close an unprecedented period in recent history where two popes have coexisted, a situation that has caused tensions within rival camps in the Vatican. It eases the way for his successor, Pope Francis, to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point – impossible while the outcome would have been three popes. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer paid warm tribute to Benedict, referring to his 2010 visit to the UK as a historic moment. Other world leaders including Ireland’s Michael D Higgins, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Germany’s Olaf Scholz also issued tributes. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, said he was a scholar, pastor and a man of God who would be remembered for “his courtesy, his gentleness, the perceptiveness of his mind and the openness of his welcome to everybody that he met”. Justin Welby, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, said Benedict was “one of the greatest theologians of his age”. Earlier this week, Pope Francis announced during his weekly audience that Benedict was “very sick” and asked for people to pray for him. Benedict, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Germany in 1927, was a deeply conservative pontiff, whose tenure was overshadowed by sexual abuse scandals in the church. He retired leaving a chequered reputation after a papacy that was at times divisive. The son of a policeman, he grew up in rural Bavaria and at the age of 14 joined the Hitler Youth, a requirement, and served in the German army in the second world war.","Pope Benedict XVI was the leader of the Catholic church. He was the Pope from 2005 to 2013. He stopped being Pope in 2013.

He died on Saturday. He was 95 years old. Three days before, the current Pope Francis said he was very sick.

The Vatican said Pope Francis will lead Benedict’s funeral. It will be in St Peter’s Square on Thursday.

From Monday, people can see his body. It will be in St Peter’s Basilica. People can say goodbye.

Benedict's death ends a special time. For some years, there were two Popes. This made things difficult for some people in the Vatican. They had different ideas.

Now, Pope Francis can think about stopping being Pope one day. This was hard to do when Benedict was alive. There could have been three Popes.

Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer spoke well of Benedict. They said his visit to the UK in 2010 was important.

Other leaders also spoke about him. These leaders were from Ireland, France, Italy, and Germany.

Cardinal Vincent Nichols is a leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales. He said Benedict was a smart man. He was also a kind leader and loved God. He will be remembered as polite, gentle, and open to everyone.

Justin Welby is the leader of the Anglican church. He said Benedict was a great thinker.

Pope Francis said Benedict was sick earlier this week. He asked people to pray for him.

Benedict was born in Germany in 1927. His name was Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger. He was a Pope with old-fashioned ideas. There were problems with bad things that happened in the church during his time. He left with a mixed reputation, and some people disagreed with his actions as Pope.

His father was a policeman. He grew up in Germany. When he was 14, he joined the Hitler Youth. This was something he had to do. He was also in the German army during the war."
38,38_1,1,"Towards the end of the war, he deserted and was briefly held as a prisoner of war by US forces. He later became a major figure in the Vatican and, as Cardinal Ratzinger, served as a right-hand man to his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. He headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a Vatican department once known as the Inquisition, for 24 years, a position that earned him the nickname “God’s rottweiler”. During his tenure, allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up began to surface. His critics said he failed to grasp the gravity of the crimes and the scale of the crisis, which reached a peak several years after he was elected pope in April 2005. As well as the flood of allegations, lawsuits and official reports relating to sexual abuse and the priests’ complicity in covering it up, the Vatican was also rocked by the theft of confidential documents, many of which later appeared in an exposé of alleged corruption. In October 2012, a Vatican court convicted the pope’s personal butler, Paolo Gabriele, of stealing the papers. He told the trial he had been acting against “evil and corruption”. Benedict held uncompromising positions on homosexuality and contraception. He had strongly opposed liberation theology, a radical movement that began in South American in the 1960s and advocated clerical social activism among the poor and marginalised. His sudden resignation at the age of 85, in February 2013, the first pope to do so since the middle ages, left the church reeling. He said at the time that he did not have the strength to carry on as leader of the world’s estimated 1.2 billion Catholics. “I have had to recognise my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me,” he said. He took the title of Pope Emeritus, and pledged to remain “hidden to the world”, devoting himself to private prayer. He retired to in a monastery in Vatican City, where he read, wrote letters and articles, received guests and played the piano. But the former pope remained a powerful conservative influence and a focus for opponents of Francis’s efforts to reform the church and redirect it to serving the poor.","Near the end of the war, he left the army. The US army caught him and kept him as a prisoner for a short time.

Later, he became important in the Vatican, which is the center of the Catholic Church. He became Cardinal Ratzinger. He worked closely with Pope John Paul II before him. He was like the Pope’s helper.

He was in charge of a special group in the Vatican. This group used to be called the Inquisition. He was the head of this group for 24 years. Because of this, people called him ""God’s rottweiler.""

During his time, people started talking about priests hurting children. They said the church was hiding it. Some people said he did not understand how serious this was. The problem became very big after he became Pope in 2005.

There were many stories, court cases, and reports about the abuse. There were also stories about priests helping to hide the abuse. Also, secret papers were stolen from the Vatican. These papers talked about bad things happening in the church.

In 2012, a court said the Pope’s helper, Paolo Gabriele, stole the papers. He said he did it to stop bad things in the church.

Benedict had strong ideas about some things. He did not agree with homosexuality or using birth control. He was against liberation theology. This was a movement to help poor people. It started in South America.

He suddenly quit being Pope in 2013. He was 85 years old. He was the first Pope to quit in a very long time. The church was very surprised. He said he was not strong enough to lead the Catholic Church. There are about 1.2 billion Catholics in the world. He said he could not do his job well anymore.

He became Pope Emeritus. He said he would stay away from the world. He would spend his time praying. He lived in a church building in the Vatican. He read, wrote letters, and played the piano. People visited him.

He was still important. People who did not like Pope Francis's ideas listened to him. Pope Francis wanted to change the church and help poor people more."
38,38_2,2,"He repeatedly made his views known through letters, articles and interviews. In April 2019, two months after Francis convened a groundbreaking Vatican conference on sexual abuse, Benedict published a 6,000-word letter saying abuse was a product of a culture of sexual freedom dating from the 1960s. In January 2020, Benedict publicly defended clerical celibacy, as Francis was considering allowing married men to become priests in limited circumstances. “I cannot keep silent,” he wrote in a book, From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church, arguing that priestly celibacy protected the mystery of the church. The controversy, which erupted just before The Two Popes – a film about the apparently warm relationship between Benedict and Francis – was aired on Netflix, exposed tensions between rival Vatican camps. Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida in Rome","He often talked about his ideas. He wrote letters. He wrote stories for newspapers. He also gave interviews.

In April 2019, something important happened. Pope Francis had a big meeting about sexual abuse in the Vatican. It was the first time they talked about it like that.

Two months later, Benedict wrote a long letter. It was 6,000 words long. He said that sexual abuse happened because people started being more free with sex in the 1960s.

In January 2020, Benedict spoke about priests not being married. This is called celibacy. Pope Francis was thinking about letting married men become priests sometimes.

Benedict said, “I have to say something.” He wrote a book. The book was called ""From the Depths of Our Hearts."" It was about priests, celibacy, and problems in the church. He said that celibacy keeps the church special.

This caused a lot of disagreement. It happened just before a movie called ""The Two Popes"" came out. The movie showed that Benedict and Francis seemed to like each other. The disagreement showed that different groups in the Vatican had different ideas.

Angela Giuffrida helped write this story in Rome."
39,39_0,0,"As a child in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso remembers excitedly readying himself in front of a handheld meat grinder to crush cashews. It was his part in his family’s annual tradition of preparing a 60-year-old recipe for Christmas cake that had been passed down for generations. Christmas cake – a moist, decadent treat filled with nuts and fruit – usually kicks off the holiday season on the island nation, and for immigrants in the US, has become a way to preserve traditions from back home. Sri Lanka’s Christmas cake is similar to the fruit cake, a quintessentially British dish, but has since evolved from its colonial roots. Like the British version, Christmas cake includes raisins and cherries, but also preserved ginger, the green vegetable chayote (or chow chow, as Sri Lankans call it) in sugar syrup, preserved melon (known as puhul dosi), candied peel, sultanas and aromatics like nutmeg. “It definitely has been adapted to the Sri Lankan palate,” says Cumaraiah-Misso, 34, now a medical student living in Fort Worth, Texas. He still remembers being a child and the earthy aromas of cinnamon and cardamom intermingling with the sweet smell of rose essence while being elbow-deep in a 25-gallon bucket, mixing finely chopped fruit semolina with butter. Marie Shirlene Fernando, 58, a caterer and mother of three living in Cerritos, California, remembers watching her aunt make the cake as a little girl. As a teenager, she took over the responsibility of making the stodgy treat, first for her ailing grandmother and later for her extended family to give as wedding favors. Now, she makes it with her 10-year-old granddaughter for customers across the United States. She carefully wraps the final product in parchment paper and brightly colored cellophane. This year, one of the packages will be shipped to her family in Sri Lanka.","When Oryan was a child in Sri Lanka, he lived in Colombo. He remembers being excited to crush cashews. He used a small machine to do this. It was part of his family's Christmas tradition.

They made Christmas cake every year. The recipe was 60 years old. It was passed down in his family for a long time.

Christmas cake is a sweet cake with nuts and fruit. People in Sri Lanka eat it at Christmas time. For Sri Lankans living in America, it is a way to remember their home.

Sri Lankan Christmas cake is like British fruit cake. But it is different now. It changed over time.

Like British cake, it has raisins and cherries. But it also has ginger and a green vegetable called chayote. Sri Lankans call it chow chow. It also has melon and spices like nutmeg.

Oryan is 34 years old now. He studies medicine in Texas. He remembers the smells of cinnamon and cardamom from when he was a child. He also remembers mixing fruit with butter in a big bucket.

Marie Shirlene Fernando is 58. She lives in California and makes food for parties. She watched her aunt make the cake when she was a girl.

When she was a teenager, she started making the cake. She made it for her grandmother who was sick. Later, she made it for her family to give at weddings.

Now, she makes the cake with her granddaughter. They sell it to people all over America. She wraps the cake in paper. This year, she will send one to her family in Sri Lanka."
39,39_1,1,"Given the country’s recent economic and political woes, she hopes the beloved dessert will help evoke unity and remind her mother, sister and extended family, of simpler times of gathering around the table to prepare the cake ingredients. In Sri Lanka, as the country’s hotels gear up for the holiday season, some host cake-mixing parties, where people get a view of culinary staff combining the fruit and nut mixture with the wet ingredients in a custom-built, 9ft-deep barrel. The mix weighs more than 4,000lb. This year, one even took place aboard a naval ship. Fernando said she was watching the Galle Face Hotel’s recent Christmas cake mixing ceremony and thought to herself, “Oh, I’m so glad in spite of all that’s going on, they are still doing it.” These traditions were in jeopardy this year as the nation battled its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Government corruption, financial mismanagement, sluggish economic growth since the pandemic, the depletion of foreign reserves and the war in Ukraine led to widespread blackouts, shortages of essential goods and school closures earlier this year. Islandwide protests ultimately led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the resignation of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. Inflation hit an all-time high of 69.8% in October before dropping slightly to 61% in November. While Fernando is hopeful that the nostalgia of Christmas cake-making will provide some joy to celebrations, Cumaraiah-Misso worries about how the increased prices of ingredients will affect this longstanding tradition. On local Facebook groups, bakers lament the rising cost of ingredients, with some commenting that they have chosen not to make the treat this year and are readying themselves for an “austere Christmas”. In a country ravaged by a 30-year civil war fought on ethnic lines and where, in 2019, at least 290 people died as bombs ripped through three churches on Easter Sunday, Christmas cake can unite across religions. It’s not just the 8% of the country’s Christian population that enjoy it. “There are so many Buddhists, Muslims, friends who I have who are non-Christians.","The country of Sri Lanka has had some problems. There have been issues with money and politics. A woman hopes that making a special cake will help. She wants it to remind her family of happy times. She wants to remind her mother, sister and other family members of times when they gathered together to make the cake.

In Sri Lanka, hotels are getting ready for the holidays. Some hotels have cake-mixing parties. People can watch the cooks mix things together. They mix fruit, nuts, and wet things in a big barrel. The barrel is very big and deep. The mix is very heavy. This year, one party was even on a ship.

The woman, Fernando, watched a cake mixing party at a hotel. She was happy that they were still doing it, even with all the problems.

These traditions were in danger this year. Sri Lanka had its worst money problems in a long time. There was trouble with the government and how money was used. The economy was slow. The country did not have much money saved. The war in Ukraine made things worse. There were power cuts, not enough goods, and schools closed.

People protested. The president had to leave. The prime minister also left. Prices went very high.

Fernando hopes the cake will make people happy. But another woman, Cumaraiah-Misso, is worried. She thinks the high prices will make it hard to make the cake.

Some bakers are sad. They say the ingredients cost too much. Some will not make the cake this year. They are ready for a simple Christmas.

Sri Lanka had a long war. It was a war between different groups of people. In 2019, many people died in bomb attacks on churches. Christmas cake can bring people together, even people of different religions. Not only Christians like the cake. Many Buddhists and Muslims also enjoy it."
39,39_2,2,"They love the Christmas cake, and they wait for a piece of Christmas cake,” Fernando said. She recalls them asking, “Where is my share? Did you keep me a piece?” Indrika Arnold, a wealth adviser in Lebanon, New Hampshire, has found another set of fans for her Christmas cake: her American co-workers. “I have some colleagues at work with whom I shared a piece, and they loved it. Now, they always ask, ‘When are you making your spice cake?’” she said. “I even mail it to some of my friends who no longer work with me.” She only made a half recipe when she started making Christmas cake five years ago. Now she’s doubled it. Arnold moved to the US 22 years ago but only started making the rich cake – as it’s known at other times of year – to share the tradition with her 12-year-old daughter. She has core memories of sitting around the kitchen table with her siblings and parents, cutting the preserved fruit into small pieces, and sneaking bits of raisins and cashews into her mouth when no one was looking. “A week or two before Thanksgiving, I get all the ingredients, and we actually get together as a family and cut it and we all take turns mixing the booze and the honey,” she said about how she continues this tradition with her daughter and husband in the US. She then leaves the fruits to stew in the alcohol mixture for at least two weeks, kick starting the holidays in their home. Like Arnold, Fernando also plans to gather around the table with her granddaughter to finely chop the fruit, which will then be soaked in a brandy mixture for one day. “By making it every Christmas, it has become a part of celebrating Christmas as Sri Lankans overseas,” Fernando said.","Fernando makes Christmas cake. People like it very much. They wait for a piece.

Fernando said people ask, ""Where is my cake? Did you save me a piece?""

Indrika Arnold lives in America. She works as a wealth adviser. She makes Christmas cake too.

Her co-workers like her cake. They ask, ""When will you make your spice cake?""

Indrika even sends the cake to her friends. These friends used to work with her.

She started making a small cake five years ago. Now she makes a bigger one.

Indrika came to the US 22 years ago. She started making the cake to share her tradition. She wanted to share it with her daughter. Her daughter is 12 years old.

She remembers making the cake with her family. They sat at the table. They cut fruit into small pieces. She would eat raisins when nobody watched.

Now, she makes the cake with her husband and daughter. They cut the fruit together. They mix alcohol and honey. This starts the holiday season.

Like Indrika, Fernando will make the cake with her granddaughter. They will cut the fruit. Then, they will soak the fruit in brandy for one day.

Fernando said, ""Making the cake every Christmas is part of our celebration. We are Sri Lankans living far away."""
40,40_0,0,"Father Happy Jacob has a reason to be cheerful. When he started St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church in Liverpool in 2002, his congregation numbered about 60 families, and stayed at that level for almost two decades. Then, a few years ago, things began to change. “We have seen a massive increase in families coming to the church,” says Jacob, 48. At his last count, there were 110 families, with worshippers including NHS workers, international students and about 100 school-age children. This story is being repeated across Britain. From Liverpool to London, Preston to Bristol, church congregations are being bolstered by Indian Christians. Most are from southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where Christianity is strong. Many have recently moved to the UK. The boom is in sharp contrast to the national trend. According to the latest census, Christianity is in decline in England and Wales: the portion of the population describing itself as Christian has fallen from 59.3% in 2011 to 46.2% in 2021. But the number of Indian Christians has surged over the same period. While they remain a small portion of the total number – about 27.5 million –who say they are Christian, the Indian contingent rose from 135,988 in 2011 to 225,935 in 2021, the fastest rise of any ethnic group. “There are lots and lots of Christians coming from India,” says Rev Joshva Raja of the British and Foreign Bible Society. As well as boosting dedicated Indian churches, the new arrivals are contributing particularly to Catholic congregations, but Raja says: “I see some of the Anglican churches growing too.” Some of those arriving grew up as part of protestant denominations that were founded in India after it gained independence in 1947. NHS worker Pradeep George, 42, secretary at the Church of South India in East Ham, east London, says the number of families attending has doubled since before Covid to about 80. Services are quite similar to Church of England ones, with hymns, bible readings and a few twists, such as plum cake – popular in Kerala. Jacob’s church in Liverpool is part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church, also known as Indian Orthodox, which traces its origins to the arrival of Saint Thomas in India in 52 AD.","Father Happy Jacob is happy. He started a church in Liverpool in 2002. It is called St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church.

At first, about 60 families went to the church. This number stayed the same for almost 20 years.

But a few years ago, things changed. Father Jacob says many more families are coming to his church.

Now, 110 families go to the church. These people include nurses and doctors from the NHS. There are also students from other countries. About 100 children who go to school come too.

This is happening in other places in Britain. Churches in Liverpool, London, and other cities are getting more people. These new people are Indian Christians.

Most of them are from the south of India. They come from places like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Christianity is strong in these places. Many of these people have just moved to the UK.

This is different from what is happening in the rest of the country. In England and Wales, fewer people say they are Christian.

In 2011, about 59% of people said they were Christian. In 2021, only about 46% of people said they were Christian.

But the number of Indian Christians is growing. They are still a small group, but their numbers are increasing fast.

In 2011, about 135,000 people in the UK were Indian Christians. In 2021, that number went up to about 225,000. This is the biggest increase of any group.

Reverend Joshva Raja works for the British and Foreign Bible Society. He says many Christians are coming from India.

These new people are helping Indian churches grow. They are also going to Catholic churches. Reverend Raja also sees some Anglican churches growing too.

Some of these people grew up in churches in India. These churches started after India became free in 1947.

Pradeep George is 42 and works for the NHS. He is the secretary at a church in East London. It is called the Church of South India. He says the number of families going to the church has doubled since before Covid. Now, about 80 families go there.

The church services are similar to services in the Church of England. They sing songs, read from the Bible, and have some special traditions. For example, they eat plum cake, which is popular in Kerala.

Father Jacob’s church in Liverpool is part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church. It is also called the Indian Orthodox church. They believe that Saint Thomas came to India in the year 52 AD."
40,40_1,1,"The church’s weekly “energetic gathering” lasts about two hours and is usually held in Malayalam, Kerala’s official language. Afterwards, people stay to socialise for much of the day, sharing foods such as appam – fluffy rice pancakes – lamb biryani or croissants with tea. There is also a Sunday school with about 100 pupils. Over Christmas, carol singers from St Thomas’s run a door-to-door service in Liverpool, Chester and beyond, visiting all the families from the congregation. This weekend, dressed in Christmas jumpers, they were in the living room of Suriya Varghese, 37, and her husband Anup Cherian, 40, who recently started attending the church with their three children. The Keralan family had been living in Qatar before moving to the UK last year after both parents got jobs as electrical design engineers for the same company. Their involvement with the church extends far beyond Sunday services. Their children – Abner, 10, Anika, 7, and Arush, 4 – attend the Sunday school, where Suriya teaches. They had help from the church network with everything from finding housing and applying for driving licences to coping with UK weather and picking trustworthy handymen. “The church plays a very big role in our lives,” says Anup. “This is about being part of the community, especially for the kids.” For Ephrem Sam Mattappallil and his friends, the support afforded by the church community has also been a lifeline. Mattappallil, 25, who moved to London last year to study, runs a support group for students within the Indian Orthodox Church, many of whom are “struggling”. Last year, it helped about 120 people. “Our parents, relatives and friends are not here, and there is financial pressure as well,” Mattappallil says. “Through the church, we can find a lot of friends, and share our experiences. It helped me a lot.” Elsewhere, Indian Christians are finding community in mainstream churches. At the Catholic church of St Osmund in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Father Jonathan Creer has been “surprised” and “delighted” by the trend.","The church has a meeting every week. It is a lively meeting. It lasts about two hours. People speak Malayalam there. Malayalam is the language of Kerala, a state in India.

After the meeting, people stay and talk. They spend a lot of time together. They eat food like appam. Appam is like soft rice pancakes. They also eat lamb biryani and croissants with tea.

The church also has a Sunday school. About one hundred children go to the Sunday school.

At Christmas time, people from the church sing Christmas songs. They go to different houses in Liverpool, Chester, and other places. They visit the families who go to the church.

This weekend, they wore Christmas sweaters. They were in the house of Suriya Varghese and her husband, Anup Cherian. Suriya is 37 years old, and Anup is 40 years old. They started going to the church recently with their three children.

This family is from Kerala. They lived in Qatar before. Last year, they moved to the UK. Suriya and Anup both work for the same company. They are electrical design engineers.

The church is very important to them. Their children go to Sunday school. The children are Abner, Anika, and Arush. Abner is 10, Anika is 7, and Arush is 4. Suriya teaches at the Sunday school.

The church helped them a lot when they moved to the UK. The church helped them find a house. They also helped them get driving licenses. The church even helped them with the weather and finding good workers for their house.

Anup says the church is very important. It helps them be part of a community. This is especially good for the children.

Ephrem Sam Mattappallil and his friends also get help from the church. Ephrem is 25 years old. He moved to London last year to study. He helps other students from the church. Many of these students have problems.

Last year, Ephrem's group helped about 120 people. He says their family and friends are not here. They also have money problems. The church helps them find friends and share their problems. This helped Ephrem a lot.

In other places, Indian Christians find a community in regular churches. At St Osmund's Catholic Church in Salisbury, Father Jonathan Creer is happy about this. He is surprised to see more Indian Christians coming to his church."
40,40_2,2,"He said that in the past two years, mass attendance has been boosted by a “huge increase in the Indian community”, many of whom work at the local NHS hospital. The Indian families also include large numbers of children, teenagers and 20-somethings, who seem to have a more positive attitude to religion than some of their young British counterparts, he says. The increase has been particularly noticeable since the Covid lockdowns. “Some of our congregation – mostly older, white people – have still not come back, and some of them died, so it’s very noticeable now, looking out at mass, that we have many Asian and other faces,” Creer said. “It’s quite surprising in Salisbury, because you walk around the streets and it seems almost a mono-ethnic place, but actually, that’s not true.” He said that despite what some might think, the new arrivals had been really welcomed with open arms. “You might imagine that in a rather staid, middle-England place like Salisbury, people might wonder what was going on, but they have been delighted.” One way the congregation has embraced the Indian newcomers is by embracing a tradition observed in Kerala of passing around a “quite large” statue of the Virgin Mary, with a different worshipper taking it home each week. “People were very enthused about that,” Creer said. At other churches, Indian Christians have found themselves in the minority. Arun Vedhanayagam Selwyn, from Chennai in Tamil Nadu, began attending the Anglican St John the Baptist church in Eltham, south-east London, after moving to the UK last year. “It’s mostly people from the local area at services,” he says. “It’s very rare to see another person from India.” At 25, the master’s student at Greenwich university is also much younger than most of the other worshippers. “Mostly it’s old age people here,” he says. “Whereas in India, people from different age categories come to the church.” Nevertheless, he has found the community “very welcoming”. The services in Eltham are also more fun, he says.","The priest said something has changed in the last two years. More people are coming to church.

He said many of these people are from India. They work at the local hospital. The hospital is part of the NHS.

These Indian families have many children and young people. The priest thinks these young people like religion more than some British young people.

He noticed this change after the Covid lockdowns.

Some older people who used to come to church have not come back. Some of them have died. So, he sees more Asian faces in the church now.

He said Salisbury seems like a place with only one type of people. But that is not true.

He also said that people have welcomed the new people. Some people might think people would be surprised. But they are happy.

The church now does something new. They pass around a statue of Mary. It is a big statue. Each week, a different person takes the statue home. This is a tradition from Kerala in India. The priest said people liked this idea.

In other churches, Indian Christians are not many.

Arun Vedhanayagam Selwyn is from Chennai in India. He goes to a church in London. It is called St John the Baptist church. He moved to the UK last year.

He said that most people at the church are from the local area. He does not see many other people from India.

He is 25 years old. He is a student. He is younger than most of the other people at the church.

He said that in India, people of all ages go to church. But he finds the people at the London church very friendly.

He also thinks the church services in London are more fun."
40,40_3,3,"Back home in India, he says, they “drag the service out for hours” whereas here it’s “very compact, so no one gets bored. I like the vibe.”","He is from India. He talks about church services there. In India, the services are long. They last for many hours. But here, the services are short. They do not take a lot of time. So, people do not get tired or bored. He likes the feeling here. He likes the way things are."
41,41_0,0,"It was 4am on a Monday and most of Rio de Janeiro was asleep. But in the Morro do 77, a favela on the gritty westside of town, the party was just getting under way as hundreds of revellers packed the community’s main thoroughfare to strut their stuff before a three-metre (10ft) wall of sound. Speakers and subwoofers pumped ear-shattering favela funk music into the dawn air. Partygoers drank pint-sized cups of whiskey and frozen coconut water. And as heads bobbed, bodies twerked and window panes shook, the rave’s unexpected name flashed up on a screen above the dancefloor in a distinctly British blaze of red, blue and white. “The Baile de Londres,” it said. “The Party of London.” “Sometimes people go straight to work afterwards,” said one of the DJs, Hyago Domingos de Lima, before his deafening setlist rendered conversation impossible. The Sunday night blowout – during which partygoers, including one wearing an England football shirt, danced until 7am – is one of scores of favela funk parties now named after cities and countries around the world. The trend began about five years ago when musicians in one of Rio’s largest favelas, the Complexo do Lins, founded the Baile da Colombia (the Party of Colombia), a reference to the Brazilian neighbour’s long-running conflict and the deadly violence that also blights many gang-controlled areas in Rio. Sensing a foreign name could increase their brand profile and attract larger audiences, event organisers in favelas across the city reached for their maps. In Chapadão they named their event after Egypt, in Parque das Missões, Poland, and in Parque Arará, Portugal. One favela opted for China and used the Chinese national flag to advertise its rave. Another chose Japan, in homage to a local gangster nicknamed after the east-Asian country. In São Gonçalo, a satellite city to Rio’s east, promoters picked US cities, including New York, Brooklyn and Las Vegas.","It was Monday morning at 4 am. Most people in Rio de Janeiro were sleeping. But in Morro do 77, a favela in the west of the city, a party was starting.

Many people were in the street. They were dancing in front of big speakers. The speakers were very loud. They played favela funk music. It was early morning, but the music was loud.

People were drinking. They had small cups of whiskey and cold coconut water. They moved their heads and bodies to the music. The windows were shaking.

Above the dance floor, there was a screen. It showed a name in red, blue, and white colors. It said: ""The Baile de Londres."" This means ""The Party of London.""

Hyago Domingos de Lima is a DJ. He said that some people go to work after the party. Then, he started playing loud music. It was hard to talk.

The party was on Sunday night. People danced until 7 am. One person wore an England football shirt. This party is like many other parties in favelas. These parties have names of cities and countries.

It started about five years ago. Musicians in Complexo do Lins, a big favela, started ""The Baile da Colombia"" (The Party of Colombia). Colombia is a country next to Brazil. There is a long war in Colombia. There is also a lot of violence in Rio.

The party organizers thought a foreign name would make the party more popular. So, they used maps to find names. In Chapadão, the party was named after Egypt. In Parque das Missões, it was named Poland. In Parque Arará, it was named Portugal.

One favela chose China. They used the Chinese flag to advertise the party. Another chose Japan. They named it after a local gangster. People called him Japan.

In São Gonçalo, a city near Rio, they chose US cities. They used names like New York, Brooklyn, and Las Vegas."
41,41_1,1,"In Rocinha they celebrated Russia with the Baile de Moscow. In Jacarezinho they created the Baile de Paris. “I think there’s one named after every single country in the world,” said Kaio Gonçalves da Silva. The 26-year-old DJ plays at funk parties named after Acapulco and Saudi Arabia in Duque de Caxias, a city to Rio’s north. On his customised Sonic the Hedgehog motorbike, it takes him five minutes to get between the two gigs. “There the Party of Canada. There’s Libya. There’s Korea … There’s Croatia. There’s Sweden. I think there’s an Italy one too … There’s Ireland. There’s Scotland,” said Da Silva, AKA DJ Kaio VDM, the composer of a recent hit celebrating the Brazil and West Ham footballer Lucas Paquetá. Luiz Júnior, a DJ and producer from a westside favela called Vila Aliança, said that by the time the area’s musicians decided to adopt a country, “there were hardly any left”. So they plumped for Romania. “To be honest, I don’t know anything about Romania. Lots of people here don’t even know what the capital is … [But] people really liked the colour of the flag,” said Júnior, whose sound system, Ignorant, rents out massive custom-made speaker systems to parties including Argentina, Mexico and Iraq. Lima, whose DJ name is HG, came up with the Baile de Londres while shooting the breeze in Morro do 77’s main square with his friends Fatty Psycho, Haze, Xiclaudio and Big Dave. At first they considered Guatemala. Then someone floated England. But the Portuguese word for England (Inglaterra) had too many syllables and was a mouthful for MCs, he said. So they opted for the Baile de Londres and a new UK-themed Rio rave was born, with fliers featuring pictures of of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. Lima, who like most of the favela’s residents has never travelled abroad, admitted his knowledge of the UK capital was patchy.","In Rocinha, people had a party called ""Baile de Moscow."" This means ""Moscow Dance"" in Portuguese. It was a party about Russia.

In Jacarezinho, they had a party called ""Baile de Paris."" This means ""Paris Dance."" It was a party about Paris.

Kaio Gonçalves da Silva is a DJ. He said that there are parties named after many countries. ""I think there’s one named after every single country in the world,"" he said.

Kaio is 26 years old. He plays music at funk parties. Some of these parties are called Acapulco and Saudi Arabia. These parties are in Duque de Caxias. This city is near Rio.

Kaio has a motorbike. It has Sonic the Hedgehog on it. It takes him five minutes to go between the parties.

Kaio said there is also a party called ""Party of Canada."" He also said there are parties for Libya, Korea, Croatia, and Sweden. ""I think there’s an Italy one too … There’s Ireland. There’s Scotland,"" he said.

Kaio is also known as DJ Kaio VDM. He wrote a song about Lucas Paquetá. Lucas Paquetá is a football player from Brazil who plays for West Ham.

Luiz Júnior is a DJ and producer. He is from Vila Aliança, a favela on the west side. He said that they wanted to name their party after a country. But almost all the countries were taken.

So, they chose Romania. ""To be honest, I don’t know anything about Romania,"" said Luiz Júnior. ""Lots of people here don’t even know what the capital is.""

He said that people liked the colors of the Romanian flag. Luiz Júnior's sound system is called Ignorant. Ignorant rents big speakers to parties. These parties include Argentina, Mexico, and Iraq.

Lima is also a DJ. His DJ name is HG. He created the ""Baile de Londres."" This means ""London Dance.""

Lima was talking with his friends in Morro do 77. His friends are Fatty Psycho, Haze, Xiclaudio, and Big Dave. They thought about calling the party Guatemala.

Then someone said England. But the word for England in Portuguese is ""Inglaterra."" It is too long for the MCs to say easily.

So, they chose ""Baile de Londres."" It was a new party about London. The party posters had pictures of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye.

Lima has never been to London. He said he does not know much about London. Most people in the favela have never traveled to other countries."
41,41_2,2,"“When I think of London I think of … all those big buildings and that lake with the bridge over it,” he said of Tower Bridge. Marcelo Henrique dos Anjos da Silva, a dancer whose mesmerising dance steps at the Baile de Londres often go viral social media, associated London with little but the cold. “It’s the sort of place you need a jacket and a scarf,” Da Silva, whose nickname is ML, said as he sat in Morro do 77’s plaza in flip-flops and shorts. The creation of the Party of London has given the Brazilian favela a curiously British feel. The main street, Francisco Brício Avenue, has been informally renamed the Retão de Londres, which roughly translates as London Street. Last year a local football team was founded: the Seleção de Londres or Team London. In true English style, they made it to the final of the favela’s annual tournament but then lost. “They thrashed us: 4-0 or something,” said Pedro Gomes, one of the team’s defenders, as he showed off the favela’s synthetic pitch wearing his union-flag-branded kit. Gomes, who works in a hospital pharmacy when not protecting London’s goal, said the baile was an essential form of leisure for overburdened residents of his deprived neighbourhood. “It’s a way locals have off enjoying themselves when all they do is work, work, work. People need to have fun too,” the 25-year-old said as the event’s giant sound system was assembled behind him outside the evangelical church Vida Em Graça (Life in Grace). Rio’s funk scene has long been criminalised and vilified by authorities and critics who accuse it of glorifying drugs, guns and sex, although in recent years the movement has been widely recognised as a culture treasure and even celebrated in one of Brazil’s top art museums. The parties are also a crucial economic lifeline for Rio’s favelas, which are home to about 20% of the city’s population.","Here's the rewritten text, adjusted to a CEFR B1 level:

It’s stressful … When you get home you’re dead after working all night,” she said of her nocturnal shifts. “But I love this community. Acapulco is my life because, like it or not, I live off Acapulco.” Wagner Oliveira, the 32-year-old owner of a clothes shop in Vila Ideal named after the Mexican holiday destination, said: “People think bailes are just about taking drugs and boozing. But the bailes benefit so many people in the community.” A born-again Christian, Oliveira no longer attended the raves and was not a fan of the musical style and its sexually explicit lyrics. Nevertheless, he called the parties a vital part of favela life. “Only people who live here grasp how important this is. Outsiders just don’t get it at all.” Moments later, the volume was cranked up and partiers began to arrive for a night of unbroken hedonism. Oliveira shut up shop and headed home, placing Mexico’s Aztec-inspired tricolour in his shop window beside a note to would-be customers. “Be right back,” it said.","Adriana da Silva Lucena lived in Vila Ideal, a favela.

42,42_0,0,"Production was suspended at the last operating domestic factory of Japanese automaker Daihatsu on Tuesday, as the Toyota subsidiary grapples with a safety testing scandal affecting 64 models going back more than three decades. Issues with falsified crash tests first came to light in April, when the firm admitted it had manipulated data on four models manufactured in Thailand and Malaysia from 2022 until this year. The company has since acknowledged that similar issues have occurred across almost its entire production process, with an internal investigation discovering falsified data dating back to 1989. “We betrayed the trust of our customers,” said Daihatsu CEO Soichiro Okudaira at a Tokyo press conference last week. “All the blame is on the management.” On 20 December the company announced it would halt shipments of all models while further investigations and safety checks are carried out. Initial investigations have found that the shortening of vehicle development time was likely the main cause of corners being cut on safety checks. Head of the investigating panel Makoto Kaiami said, “There was tremendous pressure on employees as altering sales schedules due to test failures was widely seen as unacceptable.” Daihatsu identified doors that can become difficult to open from the outside after an accident as the major safety issue, though there have been no reports of related injuries. Included in the 64 models are vehicles manufactured by Daihatsu under contract for Toyota, Mazda and Subaru. Production is currently set to be suspended at its factories across Japan until at least the end of January, affecting 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 suppliers. Daihatsu produced about 870,000 vehicles in Japan last year, a supply chain worth approximately 2.2tn yen (US$15bn). Daihatsu, which was founded in Osaka in 1907 and taken over by Toyota in 1967, is currently negotiating with unions and suppliers over compensation while production remains suspended. Although Japanese cars are known for their safety and reliability, the industry has been hit by numerous scandals over the years. In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors finally confessed to covering up defects in its vehicles dating back to 1977, after partially admitting to related problems four years earlier. Similar issues then emerged at its subsidiary Fuso Truck and Bus in what became one of Japan’s worst corporate scandals.","The Daihatsu car factory in Japan has stopped making cars. This factory was the last one working in Japan. Daihatsu is a company that belongs to Toyota.

There is a problem with the safety tests of Daihatsu cars. The company lied about the tests. This problem affects 64 different models of cars. Some of these cars were made more than 30 years ago.

The problem started in April. Daihatsu said they changed the test results for four car models. These cars were made in Thailand and Malaysia. The company did this from 2022 until this year.

Now, Daihatsu says that the problem is bigger. It happened in almost all of their car production. An investigation found that they changed data since 1989.

The boss of Daihatsu, Soichiro Okudaira, said sorry. He said that they broke the trust of their customers. He also said that the managers are to blame.

On December 20, the company said they would stop sending out all car models. They need to do more investigations and safety checks.

The first investigation found that the problem was because they wanted to make cars faster. They did not do all the safety checks carefully.

The person in charge of the investigation, Makoto Kaiami, said that workers felt a lot of pressure. They thought it was bad if they changed the sales plan because of failed tests.

Daihatsu said that the biggest safety problem is with the doors. After an accident, the doors might be hard to open from the outside. But, no one has been hurt because of this yet.

The 64 car models include cars made for Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru. Daihatsu makes these cars for them.

The factories in Japan will not make cars until the end of January. This affects 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 companies that supply parts.

Last year, Daihatsu made about 870,000 cars in Japan. This is worth about 2.2 trillion yen (15 billion US dollars).

Daihatsu started in Osaka in 1907. Toyota took over the company in 1967. Daihatsu is talking to the workers and suppliers about money because the factory is closed.

Japanese cars are known to be safe and good. But, there have been many problems in the car industry.

In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors said they hid problems with their cars. These problems started in 1977. They had already said there were some problems four years before.

Then, there were similar problems at Fuso Truck and Bus, which belongs to Mitsubishi. This was a big problem for companies in Japan."
42,42_1,1,"Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Subaru and Yamaha Motors were all embroiled in inspections and data-tampering scandals between 2017 and 2018. Daihatsu’s parent company Toyota paid a record $1.2bn settlement to the US Justice Department in 2014 over a series of claims about accelerator pedals and subsequent accidents. No mechanical fault was ever discovered despite numerous investigations and driver error remains the most likely explanation for the crashes that occurred.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

---

From 2017 to 2018, some car companies had problems. These companies were Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Subaru and Yamaha Motors. They had problems with checking their cars. They also changed some information about the cars. This was not right.

Daihatsu is a company that belongs to Toyota. In 2014, Toyota had to pay a lot of money. They paid $1.2 billion to the government in the United States. This was because people said there were problems with the car pedals. People said the pedals caused accidents.

Many people looked into these accidents. They tried to find a problem with the cars. But they did not find any problem with the car parts. It is possible that the drivers made mistakes. Driver mistakes might be why the accidents happened.

43,43_0,0,"Before the arrival of Lundin Oil in the town of Leer, now part of South Sudan, life there was peaceful, says George Tai Kuony. His childhood was that of a “typical village boy”, driving cattle, helping his family and going to school. But in June 1998, when he was 15, armed forces entered the town and changed his life for ever. He fled, became separated from his family and hid for seven days before he was able to return. “When we got there, Leer wasn’t the town I had left seven days ago,” says the 40-year-old lawyer and human rights defender. “Everything was burned down, everything was destroyed. I could see the bodies of dead people lying in the street.” As a result of the conflict, he lost his father, and later his mother and one sibling. At the time, he says, the community had no idea why people were fighting. They had never heard of the Swedish oil company. Now, a quarter of a century later, Kuony hopes that he and the other victims will get justice as two former executives of the company go on trial in Stockholm accused of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sudan between 1999 and 2003. In Sweden’s largest-ever trial, Ian Lundin, a Swede, and Alex Schneiter, who is Swiss, stand accused of asking Sudan’s government to make its army and allied militia responsible for security at one of Lundin Oil’s exploration fields. This led to aerial bombings, civilian killings and the burning of entire villages, according to the prosecution. Both men deny the charges. The trial, which follows a decade-long investigation, hundreds of interviews and an 80,000-page report by the prosecution, started in September. But its most significant moments are expected in 2024, when 61 witnesses – including victims, Lundin employees, former UN staff and high-profile politicians – are due to appear. They include Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, who sat on the company’s board for five years until becoming the country’s foreign minister. “My life has never been the same,” says Kuony, speaking to the Observer from South Sudan’s capital, Juba, where he now lives.","George Tai Kuony says that life in his town was good before Lundin Oil came. His town was called Leer. It is now in South Sudan.

He was a normal village boy. He took care of cows, helped his family, and went to school.

But in 1998, when he was 15, soldiers came to his town. This changed his life.

He ran away from the soldiers. He lost his family. He hid for seven days. Then he went back to Leer.

He is now 40 years old. He is a lawyer and helps people with their rights. He said Leer was not the same.

“When we got there, Leer wasn’t the town I had left seven days ago,” he said. Everything was burned. Everything was broken. He saw dead people in the street.

He lost his father in the fighting. Later, he lost his mother and one of his brothers or sisters.

At that time, the people did not know why they were fighting. They did not know about the oil company. The oil company was from Sweden.

Now, it has been 25 years. George hopes he and other people who were hurt will get justice. Two men who worked for the oil company are going to court in Stockholm. They are accused of helping with war crimes in Sudan. This happened between 1999 and 2003.

The trial is very big in Sweden. One man is Ian Lundin. He is from Sweden. The other man is Alex Schneiter. He is from Switzerland.

They are accused of asking the government of Sudan to use its army to protect the oil company's land. The army and other soldiers then bombed the area. People were killed. Villages were burned.

The two men say they did not do these things.

The trial started in September after a long time of checking. The police talked to many people. They wrote a long report. The report is 80,000 pages long.

Important things will happen in 2024. Sixty-one people will speak in court. These people include victims, people who worked for Lundin, people who worked for the United Nations, and important politicians.

One of them is Carl Bildt. He used to be the Prime Minister of Sweden. He was on the oil company's board for five years. Then he became the Foreign Minister.

“My life has never been the same,” said George. He is now in Juba, the capital of South Sudan."
43,43_1,1,"“Oil came to our area: it should have been a blessing. It should have been for the benefit of the community.” Instead, there was “a massacre. They wanted us dead. They wanted us to go away.” Kuony has been trying to get justice since 2006, when the group unsuccessfully sought redress at a court in Sudan. He hopes the trial, whatever its outcome, will set a new legal precedent for global corporations working in foreign jurisdictions, sending a “very strong message” that they cannot act with impunity. “That one day they will be prosecuted in the same way.” But the victims have already been dealt a significant blow. Ebony Wade, a legal adviser at Stockholm-based human rights organisation Civil Rights Defenders, said Stockholm district court’s decision in November to separate the plaintiffs’ damage claims from the criminal trial would make it “significantly harder” – if not impossible – to have their cases heard, and would considerably delay the justice process. While the plaintiffs’ testimonies were still expected to be included in the criminal trial, she said, this could push the civil claims back until the criminal trial was over, which would not be until February 2026. However, May 2024 will be a historic moment: for the first time the court will hear the experiences of plaintiffs and victims from South Sudan. “It’s incredibly rare for corporate executives to be held accountable for grave human rights violation,” says Wade. “For the first time, the leadership of a multinational company is being put on trial in a European country on allegations that they were complicit in war crimes in the conduct of their business activities.” She adds: “There are very few opportunities for victims of grave international crimes to seek redress, so in that sense this is an incredibly important trial.” Rev James Ninrew Dong, of the Presbyterian Church in South Sudan, fled Leer after religious buildings were targeted. The priest, who is a witness and a plaintiff in the case, said he felt compelled to testify: “They attacked us. They displaced us. What made me sorry is that people came to the church seeking safety and were not able to get it. They were also displaced.” For him, the case demonstrates the different standards applied by European companies operating in Africa.","Oil came to our town. It should have been a good thing. It should have helped everyone in our community.

But it was not good. It was a terrible thing. There was a big killing. They wanted to kill us. They wanted us to leave.

Kuony wants justice. He has been trying to get justice since 2006. He asked a court in Sudan, but it did not work.

Now, he hopes for a new trial. He hopes it will teach big companies a lesson. These companies work in other countries. He wants them to know they must follow the rules. They cannot do bad things without punishment. He wants them to be punished like everyone else.

But it is hard for the people who were hurt. Ebony Wade works for a human rights group. She said the court in Stockholm made a bad decision. The court will hear the criminal part of the case first. It will hear about the damage claims later. This will make it very difficult for the victims to be heard. It will take much longer to get justice.

The victims will still tell their stories in the criminal trial. But the case about money will be delayed. It might not start until 2026.

However, May 2024 will be important. The court will listen to the people from South Sudan. This is the first time this will happen.

Ebony Wade said it is rare for company leaders to be punished for hurting people. This is the first time a big company is on trial in Europe. The company is accused of helping with war crimes. These crimes happened while they were doing business.

She said it is very hard for victims of big crimes to get justice. This trial is very important because it gives them a chance.

Rev James Ninrew Dong is a priest. He ran away from his town after the churches were attacked. He is a witness in the case. He also wants justice. He felt he had to tell his story.

He said they attacked us and made us leave our homes. People went to the church for safety, but they were not safe. They had to leave too.

He thinks European companies act differently in Africa. He believes they have different rules for Africa."
43,43_2,2,"“Sweden is the champion of peace in the whole of Europe and this is where the Nobel prize is always done,” he says. “We were surprised to see that some citizens of the same country do not even care and do not even listen to what the history is.” For the case to finally be in court is a relief, he adds. “Can they do that in Norway? Can they do that in Sweden? Can they do that in any of the European countries? Of course no – the answer is no.” • The headline of this article was amended on 16 January 2024 to refer to “South Sudanese” rather than “Sudanese” and a picture caption was amended to refer to Juba, South Sudan, not Juba, Sudan.","He said that Sweden is very good at peace in Europe. The Nobel Peace Prize happens in Sweden. He was surprised. Some people from the same country did not care about peace. They did not listen to history.

He is happy that the case is in court now. He asked a question. Can people do this in Norway? Can they do it in Sweden? Can they do it in other European countries? The answer is no, they cannot.

The article headline was changed on January 16, 2024. It now says ""South Sudanese"" instead of ""Sudanese."" A picture description was also changed. It now says Juba, South Sudan, not Juba, Sudan."
44,44_0,0,"Accusations are growing that the former Sri Lankan government, led by strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, blocked an investigation into the country’s worst terrorist attack amid claims that they had helped orchestrate the blasts in order to return to power. In the attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019, six suicide bombers targeted churches and luxury hotels across the country, killing 269 people, including eight British tourists. But almost five years on, an investigation has failed to provide any answers for how the attacks took place and the security failures that led up to them. So far, there have been no criminal convictions. Instead, people previously involved in the investigation, and the leader of Sri Lanka’s Catholic church, have alleged that inquiries were repeatedly sabotaged and obstructed by the Rajapaksa government. In a recent documentary for Channel 4’s Dispatches, a whistleblower alleged that the attacks were part of a plan to create instability in Sri Lanka and ensure that Rajapaksa, a member of Sri Lanka’s most powerful political family, would win the presidential elections in 2019. The source said he had helped an intelligence officer with close ties to the Rajapaksa family meet members of the local Islamist militant group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ), that carried out the attack. He said it had been part of a plan that had been hatched over a couple of years to create an “unsafe” security situation that would help bring Rajapaksa to power. The Rajapaksa family had ruled Sri Lanka for almost a decade from 2005. They were credited with ending its bloody, 26-year-long civil war but became notorious for their authoritarian methods, including the use of “death squads” to target critics and journalists. Mahinda Rajapaksa was ousted in 2015 after a backlash against alleged corruption, but the family had planned a return to power in the 2019 election, this time with younger brother Gotabaya as the presidential candidate. He won the election but was toppled dramatically from power in July last year, after the country experienced a catastrophic economic crisis, and replaced by Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is seen as close to the Rajapaksa family.","Some people say the old government of Sri Lanka stopped an important investigation. This government was led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He was a very powerful president.

The investigation was about a big terrorist attack. Some people think the government helped plan this attack. They say the government wanted to get back in power.

The attack happened on Easter Sunday in 2019. Six people killed themselves by using bombs. They attacked churches and nice hotels. 269 people died, including eight people from Britain.

Now, it is almost five years later. The investigation has not found out how the attack happened. It also has not found out why the security was so bad. No one has been found guilty in court.

Some people who worked on the investigation say the Rajapaksa government made it difficult. The leader of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka also says this. They say the government stopped the investigation many times.

A person who knows about the attack spoke about it in a TV show. This person said the attack was part of a plan. The plan was to make Sri Lanka unsafe. This would help Rajapaksa win the election in 2019.

The person said he helped an intelligence officer. This officer was close to the Rajapaksa family. He helped the officer meet some people. These people were from a group called National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ). This group did the attack.

The person said the plan took a few years to make. The plan was to make Sri Lanka feel ""unsafe."" This would help Rajapaksa become president.

The Rajapaksa family had ruled Sri Lanka for almost ten years. They started in 2005. Some people say they did a good job ending a long war. But they also did bad things. They used ""death squads"" to hurt people who spoke against them, like reporters.

Mahinda Rajapaksa was president before. He was voted out in 2015. People thought he was doing bad things, like taking money. The family wanted to be in power again in 2019. This time, Gotabaya, his younger brother, wanted to be president.

He won the election. But he lost power in July last year. Sri Lanka had big money problems. Ranil Wickremesinghe became the new leader. Some people think he is friends with the Rajapaksa family."
44,44_1,1,"Ravi Seneviratne, the former director general of police who initially led the Easter attacks investigation, told the Observer that after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected president, the government had “prevented the investigation”. He said his team had already “established links” between state and military intelligence officers and the NTJ suicide bombers. He said that the investigations had also led him to believe there was someone higher up helping to coordinate the attack who had yet to be apprehended. However, when Rajapaksa took office, Seneviratne’s entire team at CID was taken off the case. More than 20 of his officers were transferred without his approval and travel bans were imposed on all 700 CID officers. “The motive was to make them too scared to send a message. Many were too scared to work and some people even applied for transfers out of CID,” he said. Since then, Seneviratne claims there have been several attempts to “keep me quiet”. The targeting of those involved in the investigation took a murkier turn this month after the attorney general told the courts that there had been a conspiracy to murder Shani Abeysekara, the former head of Sri Lanka’s CID, who was overseeing the investigation before he was suddenly removed when the Rajapaska government came to power. A court petition filed by Abeysekara, which was taken up this month, said a plan to kill him in a staged vehicle accident had been uncovered. The petition identifie dhis involvement in the bombing investigation as one of the reasons for the assassination attempt. Upul Jayasuriya, the lawyer representing Abeysekara, said that his client’s involvement in the Easter bombing investigation was “one of the biggest problems”. Still fearful for his life, Abeysekara declined to comment directly on the case. Last year, Abeysekara went public with allegations that prior to the attacks – when the CID was already investigating NTJ militants – state and military intelligence officers had sabotaged the investigation and “fabricated” evidence to divert investigators away from the group, including ringleader Zahran Hashim, who later carried out one of the suicide bombings.","Ravi Seneviratne used to be a police chief. He was in charge of the investigation about the Easter attacks. He told the Observer newspaper that the government stopped the investigation after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president.

He said his team found connections. They found connections between some government people, the army, and the bombers. The bombers were from a group called NTJ.

He also thought someone important helped the bombers. This person was not caught yet.

But when Rajapaksa became president, Seneviratne's team was stopped. They could not work on the case anymore. More than 20 of his police officers were moved to other jobs. He did not agree with this. Also, 700 police officers could not travel.

Seneviratne said the government wanted to scare them. They wanted to stop them from talking. Many officers were afraid to work. Some even asked to leave their jobs.

Seneviratne said people tried to silence him. They wanted him to stop talking about the case.

Something bad happened this month. The top lawyer told the court that someone planned to kill Shani Abeysekara. Abeysekara used to be the head of the police. He was in charge of the investigation before Rajapaksa became president. Then he was removed from his job suddenly.

Abeysekara made a request to the court. This month, the court looked at his request. He said someone planned to kill him. They wanted to make it look like a car accident. He thinks the bombing investigation is the reason.

Upul Jayasuriya is Abeysekara's lawyer. He said that Abeysekara's work on the Easter bombing case was a big problem for some people.

Abeysekara is still scared for his life. He did not want to talk about the case.

Last year, Abeysekara said something important. He said that before the attacks, the police were already looking into NTJ. But some government and army people stopped the investigation. They made up fake evidence. They wanted the police to look somewhere else. They wanted to protect the leader of the bombers, Zahran Hashim. He later did one of the bombings."
44,44_2,2,"He has also alleged that his attempts to raise the issue of NTJ militants with the national security council had been obstructed. After the Easter bombings, he said, his investigators had established links and vidence of communication between intelligence officials and members of the NTJ group that carried out the attacks. Another former CID officer who was part of an investigation into NTJ militants months before the bombings, and who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, confirmed the accounts. “There were several attempts that were made by the military intelligence and state intelligence to sabotage the criminal investigation department’s work,” he said. While more than 200 people have been charged in the investigation, so far no one has been convicted, and there have been no answers on how several specific high-level warnings about the imminent attacks, particularly from Indian intelligence, were ignored. In January, former president Maithripala Sirisena, who was in power at the time of the attacks, was ordered by the supreme court to pay millions in compensation to the victims. Following the Dispatches revelations, the Sri Lankan government said it had set up a special parliamentary committee to investigate allegations, but sources said that no one had been called to testify before it. A recent statement by the ministry of defence said the government “vehemently denounces the accusation of orchestrating the attack and assisting the bombers against a dedicated senior military officer who has served the nation for 36 years”. The ministry added that “successive Sri Lankan governments have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth”. Gotabaya Rajapaksa could not be reached for comment. Among the harshest critics of the ongoing failures is Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka, who alleges there was a cover-up from the highest levels of government. “When Gotabaya Rajapaksa came to power, he appointed a stooge to take over the case who made a blunder of all investigations,” he said. “We know that there are several occasions when evidence was deliberately covered up.","He said he tried to talk about the NTJ group with the people in charge of national security. But he said they stopped him.

After the Easter bombings, he said his team found connections. They found proof that some intelligence people talked to people in the NTJ group. This group did the attacks.

Another police officer used to work on the NTJ case before the bombings. He wanted to stay secret because he was worried. He said the same thing. He said the army and state intelligence tried to stop the police work.

More than 200 people are charged with crimes because of the bombings. But no one is found guilty yet. Also, people are asking why important warnings were ignored. India gave some warnings about the attacks, but no one listened.

In January, the court told the old president, Maithripala Sirisena, to pay money to the victims. He was president when the attacks happened.

After the news reports, the government said they will check the claims. They made a group in the parliament to look into it. But some people say no one has been asked to talk to the group.

The Ministry of Defence said they do not agree with the claims. They said they did not plan the attack or help the bombers. They said they support a military officer who worked for the country for 36 years.

The ministry also said that the governments always tried to find the truth.

Someone tried to talk to Gotabaya Rajapaksa, but he was not available.

Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith is very angry. He is the head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka. He said people in the government are hiding the truth. He said when Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president, he put someone in charge of the case. This person made mistakes and ruined the investigation.

Cardinal Ranjith said they know that some proof was hidden on purpose."
44,44_3,3,"They have made a mockery of transparency, a mockery of accountability and a mockery of democracy.” Ranjith added: “We are demanding a transparent, accountable investigation where the politicians don’t meddle with the investigators.” For the families of the victims, the lack of justice has been excruciating. “I ask God every day to take us too. How can we live with this pain?” said Sebastian Patrick Fernando, 74, who lost his son Neranjan in the attack on St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo. “We voted for the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government thinking they would give us answers. But they have done nothing, and now people say they did it to come to power. They should be held responsible.” Thilina Harshani, who was paralysed from the waist down and lost her six-year-old son in the blast, also blames the government for inaction. “Why did this happen to us?” she said. “Why did they bomb our church? Why were we targeted? And why are the masterminds still on the loose?”","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

They have made things very unclear. They have not been responsible. They have not respected democracy. Ranjith said more. He said, ""We want an investigation. It must be clear and responsible. The politicians should not control the people who investigate.""

The families of the people who died are very sad. They have not found justice. This is very painful for them. Sebastian Patrick Fernando is 74 years old. He lost his son, Neranjan. Neranjan died in the attack at St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo. Sebastian said, ""I ask God to take me too. How can I live with this pain?""

He said, ""We voted for the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government. We thought they would give us answers. But they did nothing. Now, people say they did it to get power. They should be punished.""

Thilina Harshani cannot move her legs. She lost her six-year-old son in the bomb. She also thinks the government did not do enough. She said, ""Why did this happen to us? Why did they bomb our church? Why did they attack us? The people who planned this are still free. Why?"""
45,45_0,0,"The US government has announced the release of what it said was its last available package of weapons available for Ukraine, with Congress needing to decide on future support. According to the state department, it is worth up to $250m and includes air defence munitions and components, Himars ammunition, 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, anti-armour munitions, and over 15m rounds of ammunition. The war in 2024 “must be different from 2023”, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces has said. “Otherwise we will face what I wrote about in the article [the Economist]”, said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi. “Unfortunately, I must state that the enemy is not far behind us. In recent days, we have had a powerful confrontation applying modern technologies. But we do not spare efforts. My main mistake was that I thought that the amount of losses we inflicted on the enemy would stop anyone. But not the Russian Federation.” Zaluzhnyi, giving a press conference, said Ukrainian troops remained on a defensive line in the northern part of Maryinka. “But I can say that this settlement no longer exists. The [Russian] method is the same as it was in Bakhmut. Street by street, block by block are destroyed. The fact that we have now moved to the outskirts of Maryinka, and in some places equipped positions beyond Maryinka, seems to me to be nothing that can cause a public outcry.” “As for the conduct of hostilities around Avdiivka,” he continued, “there is no need to dwell on it and make a show of it. The conduct of hostilities is subject to the laws of war, and they are not subject to what politicians or journalists want. The enemy now has the opportunity to concentrate forces; they can do to the city in two or three months what they have done to Bakhmut.” Two people were killed in Russian drone attacks on Odesa, according to figures from the Odesa oblast governor, Oleh Kiper. A 17-year-old was among the wounded and remained in hospital. Russian shelling left 70% of Kherson without electricity, said the Kherson oblast governor, Oleksandr Prokudin.","The US government said they are sending their last package of weapons to Ukraine. Congress needs to decide if they will send more weapons later.

This package is worth about $250 million. It has things like air defense weapons and parts, and bullets for Himars. It also has big and small bullets for guns, weapons to stop tanks, and many small bullets.

The head of Ukraine's army said that the war in 2024 must be different. He said if it is not, things will be bad. He wrote about this in an article.

He also said that the enemy is getting close. He said they are using new technology in the war. But Ukraine is trying hard to fight back. He thought that the enemy would stop because of the losses they had. But Russia did not stop.

The head of the army said that Ukrainian soldiers are defending Maryinka, a town in the north. He said that the town is now gone. The enemy is destroying it like they did to Bakhmut. They are destroying it street by street. Ukrainian soldiers have moved to the edge of Maryinka.

He also talked about the fighting near Avdiivka. He said that war has rules. What politicians or journalists want does not matter. The enemy can bring many soldiers to the city. They can destroy it like they destroyed Bakhmut in a few months.

Two people died in Odesa because of Russian drone attacks. A young person, who is 17, was hurt and is in the hospital.

In Kherson, Russian bombs made most of the city lose power. About 70% of Kherson has no electricity."
45,45_1,1,"Shelling by Russian forces on Tuesday had “badly damaged” the infrastructure of the city, he said, adding that it was “difficult” to say when repairs would be completed. A railway station was attacked as a train was set to evacuate residents, killing one police officer and injuring four people. A Russian politician calling for peace in Ukraine has been denied the chance to run for president. Russia’s central election commission refused to accept the former regional legislator Yekaterina Duntsova’s initial nomination by a group of supporters, citing errors in the paperwork, including spelling. After losing Wednesday’s appeal against the commission’s decision, Duntsova said she would start working on the creation of her own political party that would stand for “peace, freedom and democracy”. Poland is getting closer to ending the truck driver blockades of several border crossings with Ukraine, says the country’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. Polish drivers have been blocking several crossings with Ukraine since 6 November, demanding the EU reinstate a system whereby Ukrainian companies need permits and the same for European truckers to enter Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks in Moscow with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and said progress had been made on plans for Russia and India to jointly produce military equipment. Jaishankar added that he expected Vladimir Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to meet next year. Russia says its newest howitzers will be deployed “soon” against Ukrainian forces. The head of the state-owned defence conglomerate Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, told the RIA news agency that testing of the new self-propelled artillery units, named Coalition-SV, had been completed and mass production had started, with the pilot batch to be delivered by the end of this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin must be stopped in his war against Ukraine or all of Europe will pay a much higher price, Moldova’s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, said in an interview published on Wednesday.","Here's the rewritten text, broken down into short, simple sentences using B1-level vocabulary and grammar:

Russian soldiers attacked a city on Tuesday. The attack made the city's buildings and roads very damaged. It will be hard to fix everything. We do not know when it will be done.

They also attacked a train station. A train was going to take people away from the city. One police officer died. Four other people were hurt.

A politician in Russia wants peace in Ukraine. But she cannot run for president. The election people said no. They said her papers had mistakes. There were spelling mistakes.

She tried to change their minds on Wednesday. But she lost. Now she will start a new political party. This party will want peace, freedom, and democracy.

Poland is almost finished with a problem at the border with Ukraine. Trucks from Poland are blocking the border. The Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, said this.

The Polish truck drivers started blocking the border on November 6. They want the EU to make Ukrainian trucks get special papers. They also want European trucks to get special papers to go to Ukraine.

The foreign minister of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, talked to the foreign minister of India, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. They talked about making weapons together. They want Russia and India to make these weapons together.

Mr. Jaishankar said that the leaders of Russia and India will meet next year. Vladimir Putin from Russia and Narendra Modi from India will meet.

Russia said they will use new big guns soon. These guns will be used against Ukrainian soldiers. The head of a big company in Russia, Sergei Chemezov, said this. The company makes weapons.

He said they tested the new guns. They are called Coalition-SV. They are now making many of them. They will send some by the end of the year.

The leader of Moldova, Maia Sandu, said something important. She said we must stop Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. If we don't, all of Europe will have to pay a big price."
46,46_0,0,"Just after 3 o’clock, the children start running towards the Arab-Jewish community centre. The activities are about to begin – though this is not the reason for their haste. Moments before, sirens wailed across Tel Aviv and Jaffa, warning of another rocket attack. Some cry out in fear as the metal shutters of the centre rattle down. Ten minutes later, after two loud booms signal that the rockets launched from Gaza have been destroyed in the air, the children file out of the malodorous basement of the centre and head for gym class, music lessons and a crafts session organised by an NGO that is trying to improve relations between Israel’s Jewish and Arab populations. Even the most enthusiastic of Standing Together’s activists and leaders admit that, after 11 weeks of war, the moment is inauspicious for such initiatives. “These are extreme times. People are still processing the Hamas attack and the war in Gaza. People are in survival mode and thinking in black and white,” said Nadav Shofet, Standing Together’s lead community organiser in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. One slender reason for hope is sharp rise in volunteers since the war began, members of the NGO say. Since the Hamas attacks in southern Israel in October, which killed 1,200 people, mainly civilians, thousands have joined the organisation. During the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed about 18,000 people, mostly women and children, and destroyed swaths of the territory, more have come forward to work with the group. “People are looking for a solution … It might seem crazy now but it’s clear the only way out is peace,” said Shofet. Outside the community centre, overlooking a sweep of beach and the Mediterranean, the municipal authorities have hung a banner bearing the slogan: “Together, all Jaffa’s residents will get through this”. Inside, a menorah for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah stands alongside a Christmas tree. The combination of rain and rockets means about only six children have turned up for the crafts session organised by Standing Together. Orit Tammuz, a 65-year-old Jewish former dancer, had brought her granddaughter Amani. “For me, all this is a natural thing.","Around 3 o'clock, children start running to a special center. It is a place for both Arab and Jewish people. The activities are going to start soon. But that is not why the children are running.

A few minutes before, loud alarms sounded in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. The alarms warned people about rockets. Some children are scared. The metal doors of the center close quickly.

Ten minutes later, there are two loud noises. These noises mean the rockets from Gaza were stopped in the air. The children leave the smelly basement of the center. They go to gym class, music lessons, and art.

A group is helping the children. This group wants Jewish and Arab people in Israel to be friends. It is called Standing Together.

The people who work at Standing Together know this is a hard time. The war has been going on for 11 weeks. Nadav Shofet works for Standing Together. He said people are still upset about the attack by Hamas and the war in Gaza. He said people are worried about staying alive and only see things as good or bad.

But there is some hope. More people want to help since the war started. Many people have joined Standing Together since October. In October, Hamas attacked Israel. 1,200 people died, mostly people who were not soldiers.

The Israeli army is fighting in Gaza. About 18,000 people have died. Most of them were women and children. Many buildings in Gaza have been destroyed. More people want to help Standing Together because of this.

Nadav Shofet said people are looking for a way to make things better. He said peace is the only answer.

Outside the center, you can see the beach and the sea. There is a sign that says: ""Together, all the people of Jaffa will be okay.""

Inside, there is a special candle holder for Hanukkah, a Jewish holiday. There is also a Christmas tree.

It is raining and there are rockets, so only six children came to the art class. The class is run by Standing Together. Orit Tammuz is there with her granddaughter Amani. Orit is 65 years old and used to be a dancer. She said helping is natural for her."
46,46_1,1,"Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Jews, in our family we don’t make a difference. There is no victory if this is not a country for all of us,” she said. Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise 21% of the population, often living in cities where they are a majority. Jaffa, with its mixed community, has attracted many young Jewish families in recent years, many with progressive views who feel out of step with the rightwards trend of Israeli society in general. This has led to sharp increases in property prices, which have forced out often poorer Arab residents. Tammuz admitted that neither Jaffa nor the crafts class was very representative of Israel, particularly at the moment. “Here, this is like being in a small bubble but we hope it will become bigger, or I don’t see any solution,” she said. Other activities run by Standing Together include food distributions to families experiencing economic hardship, renovating public bomb shelters and a series of well-attended rallies. The organisation, founded in 2016, has also set up an unarmed joint Arab-Jewish “civil guard” to protect all communities and alert police in the event of violence. The goal of many efforts was simply to bring members of different communities together, said Amir Badran, an organiser in Jaffa for Standing Together and a local politician and lawyer. This includes the popular children’s craft sessions, held every week for two months. “Although people are in big distress, they would still prefer to get together … We don’t want the kids to be afraid of each other and hate each other. Here, they get to know each other and the parents get to meet,” Badran said. Quite how difficult finding the common ground that Standing Together seeks is clear to almost everyone in Israel. The government is the most rightwing in the country’s history, including politicians accused of “inflammatory rhetoric” before the current conflict. Though there have been no major outbreaks of violence, relations between the Jewish majority and citizens who are Arab, many of whom now identify as Palestinian citizens of Israel, are tense. “At times of war people become more radical, and [the right] is using this war to incite against Palestinian citizens,” said Rula Daood, Standing Together’s co-director.","In our family, we treat everyone the same. Arabs, Muslims, Christians, and Jews are all equal. We want a country where everyone belongs. We cannot win if this is not true for everyone.

Palestinian people live in Israel. They are 21% of the people there. Often, they live in cities where most people are also Palestinian.

Jaffa is a city where different people live together. Many young Jewish families have moved there. They have new ideas. They don't like how Israel is changing to the right. Because of this, houses in Jaffa cost more money. This makes it hard for Arab people who don't have much money to live there. They have to move away.

Tammuz said that Jaffa and the crafts class are not like most of Israel. She said, ""Here, it is like we are in a small bubble. We hope it will grow bigger. If not, I don't see a good future.""

Standing Together is an organization. They help families who don't have enough money by giving them food. They fix bomb shelters for everyone to use. They also have many big meetings.

Standing Together started in 2016. They created a group of Arab and Jewish people who work together. They do not have weapons. They help protect everyone and tell the police if there is violence.

Amir Badran works for Standing Together in Jaffa. He is also a politician and a lawyer. He said that they want to bring people from different groups together. They have crafts classes for children every week for two months.

Badran said, ""People are having a hard time, but they still want to meet. We don't want the children to be scared of each other and hate each other. Here, they can meet each other. The parents can also meet.""

It is hard to find common ground in Israel. Standing Together is trying to do this.

The government of Israel is now the most right-wing it has ever been. Some politicians in the government have said things that make people angry.

There has not been a lot of violence. But Jewish people and Arab citizens in Israel do not get along well. Many Arab citizens now say they are Palestinian citizens of Israel. The situation is tense.

Rula Daood is the co-director of Standing Together. She said, ""When there is war, people become more extreme. The right-wing is using this war to turn people against Palestinian citizens."""
46,46_2,2,"“Whether you are a regular, public or political figure, if you say anything that isn’t a call for revenge or wiping out Gaza, you are seen as part of the enemy now. Writing ‘May God have mercy on Gaza, children in Gaza’ – that’s enough to get you targeted.” Since the attacks on 7 October, a series of prominent Arab Israelis have been arrested. In October, the singer Dalal Abu Amneh was arrested briefly after posting “there is no victor but Allah” alongside a Palestinian flag on Facebook. Some of the community’s most prominent political leaders were held after planning an anti-war protest. Standing Together has set up a hotline “to give people a place, Palestinian or Jews, to turn to” if they are being harassed. A recent poll found nearly 60% of Arab Israelis were afraid of being harassed and 10% had personal experience of harassment. Daood said: “This is a real setback in Israeli society, especially Jewish society. The pain people are living in and the terror they have had since 7 October … It has basically blinded people and people are beginning to lose their own humanity. “We have had so many bad moments, maybe this is the most traumatic, but we have been able to rise up after each and every incident before. We are trying to show there is still another path and another way.” Among the people watching the children making finger puppets and posters in Jaffa was Vera Deek, an Arab Christian former teacher. “We believe in coexistence … that’s why I brought my daughter here. But [the problem] is not with the children,” Deek said. “It’s very difficult to be here, trying to live a normal life, when so many people have died or are still dying.” Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost friends and relatives in Gaza but also in the attacks on 7 October. Some of the first deaths reported were four people who died when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a Bedouin village in the Negev desert. Arab Israelis responding to the ground offensive, including paramedics, were also killed by Hamas. The Negev’s Bedouin tribes were some of the first to organise volunteer teams to search for missing Israelis.","It is difficult now to say something that is not about revenge or destroying Gaza. If you say something different, people may think you are the enemy.

For example, if you write ""God help Gaza, and the children in Gaza,"" you might be in trouble.

After the attacks on October 7th, some important Arab Israelis were arrested.

In October, a singer named Dalal Abu Amneh was arrested for a short time. She wrote ""Only God wins"" and showed a Palestinian flag on Facebook.

Some political leaders were also arrested. They were planning a protest against the war.

An organization called Standing Together has created a special phone line. It is for people who are being bothered or harassed. This includes both Palestinians and Jewish people.

A recent survey showed that almost 60% of Arab Israelis are scared of being bothered. 10% have already been bothered.

Daood said that this is bad for Israeli society, especially for Jewish society. People are in pain and feel very scared since October 7th. This has made people lose their humanity.

He said that they have had many bad times before, but they always recovered. They are trying to show that there is a better way.

Vera Deek is an Arab Christian. She used to be a teacher. She was watching children make puppets and posters in Jaffa.

She said they believe in living together peacefully. That is why she brought her daughter there. But she thinks the problem is not with the children.

She said it is hard to live a normal life when so many people have died or are still dying.

Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost friends and family in Gaza. They have also lost people in the attacks on October 7th.

Some of the first people who died were in a Bedouin village. A rocket from Gaza hit the village in the Negev desert.

Some Arab Israelis helped after the ground attacks. They were paramedics and other helpers. Some of them were killed by Hamas.

The Bedouin tribes in the Negev were among the first to help. They made teams to look for missing Israelis."
46,46_3,3,"As she spoke, Deek jumped at the sounds of a construction site – similar to the booms of the anti-rocket batteries in action only a few minutes before – then explained that she was worried about her son, who was playing football in a nearby park. “Arabs and Jews must live together,” Deek said. “Ordinary people are not the problem.”","Deek was talking. Suddenly, she heard noises. The noises sounded like a building site. They were like the loud sounds of the rockets a few minutes ago. Deek said she was worried. Her son was playing football. He was in a park close by. Deek said, ""Arabs and Jews must live together."" She also said, ""Normal people are not the problem."""

But it doesn’t have to be this way, transport campaigners say, as politicians and transport bosses have the power to ease some of the problems facing travellers. There is more gloom to come in the short term, according to the RAC, with Boxing Day traffic surging, and the prospect of dangerous winds in Scotland and northern England. Around 21 million people drove to visit family or friends before Christmas, and thousands more took flights or trains as what has become known as the great Christmas getaway gained momentum. Storm Pia caused disruption to rail and road in Scotland and northern England on Wednesday. Eurostar workers in France took industrial action the following day, and the knock-on effect was huge demand for ferry services. Motorists queued for 90 minutes during peak times. Saturday was expected to be the busiest day of the year on the roads, according to the RAC and Inrix, with 20% more car journeys than last Christmas weekend. On Boxing Day they expect drivers on the M25 to face 50-minute delays, and on 27 December journeys in busy areas of the UK will be 25% longer. On Saturday Port of Dover Travel reported a 90-minute wait at French border controls as traffic built up after a surge in ferry bookings in the wake of Thursday’s Eurotunnel disruption. And the Met Office is warning of high winds in Scotland, northern England and north Wales today, with possible power cuts and flying debris. Even though the weather may be out of the control of ministers and rail chiefs, they have other ways of easing the burden on travellers, according to the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and the Clean Cities Campaign (CCC). National Highways removed 1,000 miles of roadworks on 19 December – “an early Christmas present” for drivers during the festive getaway. They will be back on 2 January. Widespread engineering works are planned for the rail network, although Network Rail said it was carrying out less work than usual, and no trains run on Christmas Day. In London, Paddington station is shut until Wednesday for HS2 works, while King’s Cross is shut today and Victoria station is not running Southeastern services until 2 January.","Many people who wanted to travel before Christmas were sad. Hundreds of trains were stopped. Roads were closed. People waited a long time to get on ferries.

Some people who want to make transport better say it does not have to be like this. They say that politicians and people in charge of transport can help. They can make it easier for people to travel.

The RAC (a car organisation) says that things will get worse soon. There will be a lot of traffic on Boxing Day (the day after Christmas). Also, there might be strong winds in Scotland and the north of England.

About 21 million people drove to see family or friends before Christmas. Many other people used planes or trains. This is called the ""great Christmas getaway.""

Storm Pia caused problems for trains and roads in Scotland and the north of England on Wednesday.

Eurostar workers in France went on strike on Thursday. This made many people want to use ferries. People had to wait 90 minutes to drive onto the ferries during the busiest times.

The RAC and Inrix (traffic information companies) said that Saturday would be the busiest day for roads. They thought there would be 20% more cars on the roads than last Christmas.

They think that on Boxing Day, drivers on the M25 road will wait 50 minutes because of traffic. On December 27th, trips in busy parts of the UK will take 25% longer.

On Saturday, the Port of Dover said people waited 90 minutes at the border. This was because many more people wanted to use ferries after the Eurotunnel problems on Thursday.

The Met Office (weather service) says there will be strong winds in Scotland, the north of England, and north Wales. There might be power cuts and things blowing around.

The weather is difficult to control, but people in charge can still help travellers. This is what the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and the Clean Cities Campaign (CCC) say.

National Highways (the people in charge of roads) took away 1,000 miles of roadworks on December 19th. They said this was a ""Christmas present"" for drivers. But the roadworks will be back on January 2nd.

There will be work on the train tracks. Network Rail (the train track company) said they are doing less work than usual. Also, no trains run on Christmas Day.

In London, Paddington station is closed until Wednesday because of HS2 (a new train line) work. King's Cross station is closed today. Victoria station will not have Southeastern trains until January 2nd."
47,47_1,1,"And passengers will be gambling with services by operators such as Avanti West Coast, which cut services in December and has seen 32% of services cancelled or severely delayed. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” said Michael Solomon Williams, CBT campaigns manager. “It’s not rational any more to distinguish between commuter travel and leisure travel.” Since the pandemic, fewer people travel during the week, he said. “People work weekends, go to football matches. There are all sorts of reasons why we need more services at weekends and Christmas, when people travel around the country more than any other time. “Another time makes more sense, like the second week of January, or on a Monday, for example.” He added that another balm for travellers would be the creation of Great British Railways, announced by the government in May 2021 but mothballed in October 2022. And passengers are being told to pay an extra 4.9% on rail fares in the new year. “They could have frozen fares the way they have with fuel duty for the last 13 years,” Solomon Williams said. “The cost of travelling by train has gone up at twice the rate of driving.” Oliver Lord, head of CCC, said that disrupting services on the busiest travel days of the year meant people were more likely to choose to take the car, adding to congestion. “A third of rail use now is on leisure,” he said. “If the three or four times a year a family wants to use trains to get out of town, and their experience is engineering works, a rail replacement bus service and journeys that take three times as long, what will they think? “It’s a great opportunity for the government to make a strategic decision,” Lord added. “If we said the first week or two of January was a time when businesses and corporations could do things a bit differently, with more working from home, that would be a great new year’s resolution from the government.” Travellers who have faced cancellations or delays should make sure they claim compensation, said Naomi Leach, deputy editor of Which? Travel. “Sadly, it seems as though serious travel disruption over the festive period is becoming increasingly commonplace, with travellers once again facing the misery of cancelled trains as they try to make it home in time for Christmas,” she said.","Some train companies like Avanti West Coast are not running many trains. They stopped some trains in December. A lot of their trains are late or canceled. This is bad for people who want to travel.

Michael Solomon Williams works for CBT. He said this does not need to happen. He thinks it is not right to separate travel for work and travel for fun.

He said that after the pandemic, fewer people travel during the week. Now, people travel on weekends and for events. We need more trains on weekends and holidays like Christmas. People travel more around the country at these times. He thinks that it is better to reduce train service at other times such as the second week of January or on Mondays.

He also said that Great British Railways would help travelers. The government announced it in 2021, but stopped working on it in 2022.

Train tickets will cost 4.9% more next year. Mr. Williams said the government could have stopped the price from going up, like they did with fuel prices for cars. He said train tickets are getting more expensive faster than driving.

Oliver Lord works for CCC. He said that when trains are not running on busy days, people will drive cars instead. This makes traffic worse.

He said that many people use trains for fun now. If a family wants to take the train a few times a year but the trains are not working well, they will not like it. They will think the train is slow and bad.

Mr. Lord said that the government could make a good plan. He said that businesses could let people work from home for the first few weeks of January. This would be a good idea for the new year.

Naomi Leach works for Which? Travel. She said that if your train is canceled or late, you should ask for money back. She said that train problems are happening more often during holidays. People are having problems getting home for Christmas."
47,47_2,2,"“If your train is cancelled or delayed, make sure you make a note of your ticket number and register a claim via Delay Repay, a nationwide scheme to compensate rail passengers for delays of 15 minutes or more. “The Eurostar operates its own compensation scheme for delays of an hour or more which accepts claims from 24 hours after the disruption took place.”","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a B1 CEFR level:

""Sometimes, trains are cancelled. Sometimes, trains are late.

If this happens to you, write down your ticket number. You can then ask for money back. This is because of a special plan called Delay Repay.

Delay Repay is for all train companies in the country. If your train is late by 15 minutes or more, you can ask for money back.

The Eurostar train company has its own plan. This plan is for trains that are late by one hour or more. You can ask for money back one day after your train was late."""

The UK Health Security Agency said the death “has been associated with this outbreak” and added later that it occurred in Scotland, but was unable to provide more information about the case. The agency said that as of 27 December there had been 30 confirmed cases in England and Scotland linked to an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), which first emerged in July. The cases involved children as young as seven and those aged up to 81, and most cases had occurred in December. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland announced a precautionary recall of four cheeses made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese on Christmas Eve due to possible E coli contamination. It added a fifth product, which is sold by Waitrose, to the recall list on 27 December. “Epidemiological and food chain investigations have identified links between some of the identified cases and a number of unpasteurised cheeses produced by a business in England,” the agency said. “UKHSA is continuing to follow up cases to identify any common links, including determining whether cases ate or came into contact with the recalled cheeses.” The products affected by the recall are: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild &amp; Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese. Amy Douglas, the agency’s incident director for gastrointestinal infections and food safety division, urged people who suspected they may have been infected not to travel over the holiday season. “There have been at least 30 confirmed cases of this specific outbreak strain of Stec in the UK,” she said. “Symptoms of Stec include severe diarrhoea (including bloody diarrhoea), stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing it on to family and friends over the festive period.","Someone in Scotland has died. They were sick with E coli. It seems to be the first death from a sickness that has made 30 people sick.

The agency said that on December 27th, 30 people in England and Scotland had E coli. This kind of E coli makes something called Shiga toxin. The sickness started in July.

Children as young as seven and people as old as 81 got sick. Most people got sick in December.

The Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland said to throw away some cheeses. This was on Christmas Eve. The cheeses might have E coli in them. They were made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese.

Later, they added another cheese to the list. This cheese is sold by Waitrose.

The agency said they found a link between the sick people and some cheeses. These cheeses were not heated to kill germs. They were made by a company in England.

The UKHSA is still checking to see if the sick people have anything else in common. They are checking if they ate the cheeses or touched the cheeses.

The cheeses you should throw away are: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild & Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese.

Amy Douglas works for the agency. She said if you think you are sick, do not travel. This is especially important during the holidays.

49,49_0,0,"The Middle East has been slipping towards the precipice of a regional war ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and the ferocious Israeli response in Gaza. The past week has shown how the cliff edge keeping it from that abyss could quickly crumble away. Within hours of the outbreak of the Gaza war, the Hezbollah Shia militia in Lebanon began to fire on northern Israeli towns and villages in solidarity with Palestinians, triggering Israeli air strikes in response, and Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea with real or perceived Israeli connections. The US moved two aircraft carriers and their accompanying strike groups to the region as American bases in Syria and Iraq came under repeated attacks from Iran-affiliated groups, drawing swift retaliation from Washington. At the same time the West Bank erupted in protests at the bombing of civilians in Gaza and extremist Jewish settlers quickly sought to ride the wave of Israeli anger by seizing Palestinian land and terrorising its residents. Each of these theatres of conflict has the potential to ignite a much-feared Middle East conflagration, and the past few days have demonstrated just how easily escalation, intended or not, could bring Israel into open confrontation with Iran, and suck in the US too. An Israeli airstrike just outside Damascus killed a senior figure in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Sayyed Razi Mousavi, who was responsible for military liaison between Syria and Iran. After Mousavi’s death last Monday, the IRGC issued a statement declaring the “usurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime”. Tehran’s Houthi allies have meanwhile have been firing on the US-led “Prosperity Guardian” naval task force assembled to protect shipping in the Red Sea. American warships shot down dozens of drones and also a handful of ballistic missiles. US Central Command issued a statement to say that Washington had “every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran”.","Since the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7th, the Middle East has become more dangerous. Israel's response in Gaza has made things worse. The region is close to a big war.

Last week showed how easily things could become much worse. The situation is very unstable.

Soon after the war in Gaza started, Hezbollah in Lebanon started shooting at towns in northern Israel. They wanted to support the Palestinians. Israel then attacked Lebanon with planes.

Also, Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea. They thought these ships were connected to Israel.

The US sent two big ships with planes to the area. American bases in Syria and Iraq were attacked many times by groups connected to Iran. The US attacked back quickly.

At the same time, people in the West Bank protested the bombing of people in Gaza. Some Jewish settlers tried to take advantage of the situation. They took Palestinian land and scared people.

Each of these situations could start a big war in the Middle East. The last few days have shown how easily things can get out of control. Israel could fight openly with Iran, and the US could be pulled into the war too.

An Israeli plane attacked a place near Damascus. It killed Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a leader from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He helped Syria and Iran work together on military matters.

After Mousavi died last Monday, the IRGC said that Israel would pay for this. They called Israel a ""savage"" regime.

Iran's allies, the Houthis, are shooting at ships in the Red Sea. These ships are part of a US-led group called ""Prosperity Guardian."" This group is there to protect ships.

American ships shot down many drones and some missiles. US Central Command said that the attacks were done by the Houthis in Yemen. But they also said that Iran helped them a lot."
49,49_1,1,"If a US warship is struck, Joe Biden would be under intense pressure to deliver a decisive response, as he enters an election year with his tenure hanging in the balance and Republicans looking to focus on any trace of weakness. On Thursday, a former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, wrote a commentary in a US newspaper expressing the view of many on the hawkish end of the security establishments in both the Israel and the US that they are doomed to fight Iranian proxies indefinitely until Iran is taken on directly. “The evil empire of Iran must be brought down,” Bennett argued in the Wall Street Journal. “The US and Israel must set the clear goal of bringing down Iran’s evil regime. Not only is this possible. It is vital for the safety and security of the Middle East – and the entire civilised world.” On Friday, the UN security council convened to discuss violence on the West Bank, but the session was quickly drawn into a discussion of a regional war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, dismissed the issue of settler violence in the West Bank as a distraction from the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon. “The situation in northern Israel is reaching a point of no return,” Erdan said, echoing an increasingly frequent warning from Israeli officials that their country would take matters into its own hands, possibly by carving out a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. “If these attacks continue, I reiterate the situation will escalate and may lead to a full-scale war. Lebanon must be held accountable for the aggression carried out from its territory,” the Israeli envoy said. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, a UN assistant secretary-general, told security council members that, while most of the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been around the border, some strikes were going deeper into each other’s territory, “raising the spectre of an uncontained conflict with devastating consequences for the people of both countries”. Khiari added that “the risk of miscalculation and further escalation is increasing as the conflict in Gaza continues”.","If a US ship is attacked, Joe Biden will have a hard time. People will want him to act strongly. He is running for president again. Republicans will say he is weak if he doesn't do much.

Naftali Bennett used to be the leader of Israel. He wrote an article in a newspaper. He said that Israel and the US will keep fighting Iran's friends. He thinks they need to fight Iran directly.

Bennett said Iran is bad and must be stopped. He said the US and Israel should try to remove Iran's leaders. He believes this is important for safety in the Middle East and the world.

The UN talked about violence in the West Bank on Friday. But the meeting became about a bigger war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, said the West Bank violence is not the main problem. He said the real danger is Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Erdan said the situation in northern Israel is getting very bad. He said Israel might have to do something itself. Maybe they will make a safe area in southern Lebanon.

He said if the attacks continue, there could be a big war. He said Lebanon is responsible for the attacks from its land.

Mohamed Khaled Khiari works for the UN. He told the UN that Israel and Hezbollah are shooting at each other. Some attacks are going far into each other's land. He said this could cause a big war that is hard to stop. It would be very bad for both countries.

Khiari said the danger of a mistake and a bigger war is growing. This is because the war in Gaza is still happening."
49,49_2,2,"Lana Nusseibeh, the envoy of the United Arab Emirates, expressed the uneasiness of the Arab world that in the absence of “bold and perhaps uncomfortable decisions” to reverse the drift towards regional conflict, “the alternative is the hellscape of Gaza expanded into the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other parts of the Middle East”. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, the UN estimates that 304 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including 79 children, along with four Israelis, three of them soldiers. Four more Israelis were killed in West Jerusalem in an attack by Palestinian gunmen on 30 November. One of the dead was mistakenly shot by an Israeli soldier. The disproportionate number of Palestinian dead showed that Israeli forces have been conducting an overkill campaign in an effort to deter an uprising in the West Bank in solidarity with Gaza, argued Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “The Israeli mindset is that they think they are preventing a third Intifada,” Elgindy said. “But I think the way they’re operating, they’re probably more like causing one.” He pointed to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as a particularly volatile element in the combustible state of the region. Overwhelmingly blamed by Israelis for the security lapses that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, Netanyahu faces a fall from power, but only when the fighting ends, or at least lessens in intensity. An escalation, on the other hand, could keep him in his post. “It is Netanyahu, frankly, who is dictating the terms on all fronts – in Gaza, on the Lebanon border, across the region – for Netanyahu’s reasons. This is his war,” Elgindy said. He added: “ I think every day that this goes on, you get closer to regional expansion of this whole mess.”","Lana Nusseibeh works for the United Arab Emirates. She said that the Arab world is worried. If we don't make big, hard choices, the problems in the area will get worse.

If things don't change, the bad situation in Gaza could spread. It could affect the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other places in the Middle East.

On October 7th, Hamas attacked. After that, the United Nations (UN) says that many people have died in the West Bank. About 304 Palestinians have died, including 79 children. Also, four Israelis have died, three were soldiers.

Four more Israelis died in Jerusalem on November 30th. Palestinian men with guns attacked them. One of the people who died was shot by mistake by an Israeli soldier.

Khaled Elgindy works at the Middle East Institute. He said that many more Palestinians have died than Israelis. This shows that Israeli soldiers are using too much force. They want to stop people in the West Bank from helping Gaza.

Elgindy said that Israel wants to stop another big uprising. They think they are preventing an “Intifada”. But the way they are acting might cause one.

He said that Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel, makes things worse. Many Israelis think Netanyahu made mistakes that allowed the Hamas attack to happen. Netanyahu might lose his job, but not until the fighting stops or gets better.

If the fighting gets worse, Netanyahu could stay in power. Elgindy said that Netanyahu is in charge of everything. He decides what happens in Gaza, near Lebanon, and in the whole area. This is his war.

Elgindy also said that every day the fighting continues, the problems are more likely to spread to other countries."
50,50_0,0,"A court in South Korea has approved an arrest warrant for the country’s suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached over his ill-fated decision to impose martial law early this month, investigators said. Yoon’s decision to declare martial law late on 3 December plunged Asia’s fourth-biggest economy into its worst political crisis for decades and caused concern in Washington. Yoon was forced to lift the order just six hours later after MPs forced their way into parliament to vote it down. The corruption investigation office confirmed that a court in Seoul had approved the warrant, but it was not clear if police would be able to execute it. “The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol … were issued this morning,” the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for Yoon, condemned the move. “The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid,” he said in a statement. Soon after investigators said they had raided the army’s counterintelligence offices as part of the growing martial law probe. “The emergency martial law investigation team of the Corruption Investigation Office is conducting a search and seizure operation at the Counterintelligence Command this afternoon,” investigators said in a statement. Yoon has so far refused to cooperate with the investigation into his martial law order. He has failed to report to investigators for questioning over allegations of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion, and his presidential security service has prevented court-ordered searches of his office and residence. Yoon also faces charges of insurrection – a crime that can carry life imprisonment or the death penalty and one of the few charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. An official from the corruption investigation office said Yoon’s refusal to be questioned had prompted the warrant request. “The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime,” the official said. The warrant is valid until 6 January, he said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.","A court in South Korea said yes to arresting the president, Yoon Suk Yeol. He was stopped from being president because of a problem with a decision he made.

Investigators said the problem was about him wanting to use the army to control the country. This happened at the start of the month.

Yoon wanted to use the army on December 3. This made the country have a big problem. It was the worst problem in many years. Other countries like the United States were worried.

Members of parliament did not agree with Yoon. They went into the parliament building and voted against his idea. Yoon had to stop his plan six hours later.

The office that investigates bad behavior said that a court in Seoul agreed to the arrest. But it is not sure if the police can arrest him.

The investigation office said that the court gave permission to arrest and search President Yoon. This happened in the morning.

Yoon Kab-keun is a lawyer for Yoon. He said that the arrest is not right. He said the office asking for the arrest does not have the power to do it.

Soon after, the investigators went to the army's offices. They were looking for information about the plan to use the army.

The investigators said they were searching the Counterintelligence Command. This happened in the afternoon.

Yoon has not helped with the investigation. He has not gone to talk to the investigators about his plan. They want to ask him about using his power in a wrong way and planning a rebellion.

His security team has stopped the court from searching his office and home.

Yoon is also charged with rebellion. This is a very serious crime. He could go to prison for life or be killed. This is one of the few crimes that a South Korean president can be charged with.

An official from the investigation office said Yoon would not answer questions. That is why they asked for the arrest.

The official said they are worried that Yoon will not come when they ask him. They also think he did something wrong.

The arrest is allowed until January 6. Yoon could be held at a police station or a jail in Seoul."
50,50_1,1,"Media reports said an imminent arrest or search of the presidential residence was unlikely, as investigators would seek to coordinate with the presidential security service. Technically, anyone obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant could be arrested. But under South Korean law, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it is unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces arrest. It is the first time an arrest warrant has been issued for an incumbent president in South Korea, according to local media. Police were deployed early on Tuesday outside Yoon’s residence in central Seoul in an attempt to prevent unrest. Yoon’s supporters and protesters calling for his removal have staked out his residence, with local media showing images of altercations between the two camps overnight. “Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?” Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon’s residence to show they were doing their work diligently and fairly. Park Sung-min, president of the Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant was probably an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with the investigation. The acting leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power party, Kweon Seong-dong, said on Tuesday that attempting to detain a sitting president was inappropriate, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the national assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December over his imposition of martial law. The constitutional court has 180 days from that date to decide whether to confirm the impeachment or reinstate Yoon, whose two-and-a-half years in office have been marred by scandal and policy deadlock. The martial law order triggered weeks of political and market turmoil. Yoon’s replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week for refusing to approve bills to facilitate the investigation into his predecessor.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

The news said that the police will probably not arrest the president or search his house soon. The police want to talk to the people who protect the president first.

If someone stops the police from arresting someone, that person can be arrested too. But in South Korea, the police cannot search places with military secrets without permission. The president probably will not let the police search his house if they want to arrest him.

This is the first time a president in South Korea might be arrested. Police came to the president's house in Seoul early Tuesday. They wanted to stop problems.

People who support the president and people who want him to leave his job are at his house. The news showed that they had some fights last night.

Choi Jin said that if the president does not want to be arrested, it is not possible. Choi Jin works at a place that studies presidents. He said the police should not fight with the president's guards.

Choi Jin said the police will still visit the president's house. They want to show they are doing their job well.

Park Sung-min said the police want to arrest the president to make him help with the investigation. Park Sung-min works for a company that gives advice about politics.

Kweon Seong-dong said it is not right to try to arrest a president who is still working. Kweon Seong-dong is a leader in the People Power party.

The president's power was taken away after a vote. People voted to impeach him on December 14 because he used martial law.

The court has 180 days to decide if the president should leave his job or go back to work. The president has had problems while working for two and a half years. There have been scandals and problems with making decisions.

The martial law caused problems with politics and money.

The person who replaced the president, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week. This was because he did not agree to some laws. These laws would have helped the investigation about the old president."

On Tuesday Choi called for national harmony and unity and for trust in the government in a New Year’s address. “The Republic of Korea is in an unprecedentedly serious situation,” Choi said in a written statement, citing changes around global trade, diplomacy and security, as well as domestic political uncertainty. “The government will do its best to run state affairs stably in all areas of defence, diplomacy, economy and society for the people to feel relieved,” he added. Agencies contributed reporting","Choi Sang-mok became the new president for a short time. This happened after Han.

Just two days later, something bad happened. A plane crashed at Muan airport. It was a very bad accident, the worst plane crash in South Korea.

On Tuesday, Choi spoke to the country. It was his New Year's speech. He said we need to be friends and work together. He said we need to believe in the government.

Choi said South Korea has big problems. He said things are changing with trade, other countries, and safety. There are also problems in our own country with politics.

He said the government will try its best. They will try to keep things calm in defense, talking with other countries, money, and our society. They want people to feel safe and not worry.

51,51_0,0,"In the wake of the April 2019 fire that devastated Notre Dame, the French president Emmanuel Macron promised that the monument would be rebuilt with a “contemporary gesture”. There followed all manner of madcap ideas: a glass spire; a 300ft carbon-fibre flame; a swimming pool on the roof; a covered garden. In the end, Notre Dame was restored to its original former glory and ceremonially reopened this month. Now, however, the planned “contemporary gesture” has been revealed – and has sparked a bitter row. The French artist Claire Tabouret has been chosen to design new stained glass windows depicting Pentecostal scenes, to be installed in the chapels on the south side of the medieval church. Tabouret was among 100 artists who took part in a competition to replace the existing six windows installed by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in 1844 – even though the windows were not damaged in the 2019 fire. Designs submitted by Tabouret, 43, a figurative artist whose work featured in the Vatican pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year and who now lives in Los Angeles, show scenes of people in prayer in shades of red, turquoise, yellow and pink. She will work with master glassmakers at the Atelier Simon-Marq, a glass workshop founded in Reims in 1640, to recreate the drawings in glass. The plan to replace the 19th-century chapel windows, which feature geometric designs described as having more historic than aesthetic value, has enraged critics. The 1964 Venice Charter, which codifies guidelines for preserving French buildings, states: “Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation,” and that “the valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected”. In July, the national committee for heritage and architecture at France’s ministry of culture unanimously opposed the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows, prompting one artist to withdraw his designs from the competition. The Académie des Beaux-Arts has also opposed the replacing of the windows.","In April 2019, there was a big fire at Notre Dame. Notre Dame is a famous church in France. The fire damaged the church a lot.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said they would rebuild it. He also said they would add something new and modern to it. People had many ideas. Some wanted a glass tower. Some wanted a big flame made of special material. Others wanted a pool on the roof, or a garden.

In the end, Notre Dame was rebuilt like it was before. It opened again recently. But now, they have a plan for a modern addition. This plan is causing a lot of argument.

A French artist named Claire Tabouret will design new windows. These windows will be made of colored glass. They will show pictures of people praying. The pictures will be about Pentecost, a religious event. These windows will go in the chapels on the south side of the church.

Many artists entered a contest to design the windows. Claire Tabouret was one of them. She won. She will replace six old windows. These old windows were put in place in 1844. They were not damaged in the fire.

Claire Tabouret is 43 years old. She is a painter. She lives in Los Angeles now. Her designs show people praying. The colors are red, yellow, pink, and turquoise. She will work with experts at a glass workshop. This workshop is very old. It started in 1640.

Some people are very angry about this plan. They don't want to remove the old windows. The old windows have simple shapes. They are from the 1800s. Some people think they are important for history.

There is a rule book for protecting old buildings in France. This book says that old parts of a building should stay. You can only remove them to protect them. The book also says to respect the changes made to a building over time.

In July, a group of experts voted against the plan. They did not want to remove the old windows. One artist even took his designs out of the contest because of this. The Académie des Beaux-Arts, a famous art school, also does not want to change the windows."
51,51_1,1,"In a statement last year, it wrote: “[The members of the academy] are concerned that the announcement of a competition for the creation of contemporary stained glass windows, which they support in principle, involves replacing the non-figurative windows ... The fire spared these windows. “The Académie des Beaux-Arts hopes that other locations, starting with the North Tower, will be considered for this commission for contemporary stained glass.” However, the plan, expected to cost more than €4m (£3.3m), has the approval of the president, the archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, and the church authorities. At a press conference after the announcement of her selection, Tabouret, a graduate of Paris’s prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, said she was “excited” by the challenge but aware of the controversy. “I’ve read about the different opinions of people because I want to understand their arguments and also to take an approach that is open and two-way. I find it a fascinating debate,” she said. She wanted to create stained glass windows that would have “the right presence … without imposing themselves on visitors”. Didier Rykner, a French journalist, art historian and founder of La Tribune de l’Art, a magazine dedicated to preserving France’s heritage, has described the idea of replacing the windows as “totally ludicrous”. He has launched a petition against the plan that has almost 250,000 signatures. “The president of the republic has decided on his own, without any regard for the heritage law or Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, to replace the stained glass windows in six out of the seven chapels on the south aisle with contemporary creations, after organising a competition,” it reads. “The stained glass windows in Notre Dame designed by Viollet-le-Duc were created as a coherent whole. It is a genuine creation that the architect wanted to be faithful to the cathedral’s gothic origins. Who gave the head of state a mandate to alter a cathedral that does not belong to him, but to everyone? “Emmanuel Macron wants to put the stamp of the 21st century on Notre Dame de Paris.","The Academy said something last year. They said they like the idea of new stained glass windows. But they are worried. The plan is to replace some old windows.

These old windows are not pictures of people. They were not damaged in the fire. The Academy thinks the new windows should go in another place. Maybe the North Tower is a good place.

The plan will cost more than 4 million euros. The president, the archbishop, and church leaders agree with the plan.

A woman named Tabouret will make the new windows. She went to a good school in Paris. She said she is happy about the work. But she knows some people do not like the plan.

She said she is reading about what people think. She wants to understand why they feel that way. She wants to talk to people and listen to them. She thinks it is an interesting discussion.

She wants to make windows that look good. She does not want the windows to be too strong or hard to look at.

Didier Rykner is a French writer and art expert. He thinks it is a bad idea to change the windows. He started a list of names against the plan. Almost 250,000 people have signed it.

The list says the president made the decision alone. He did not think about the rules for old buildings. He wants to replace the windows in six chapels. These chapels are on the south side of the church.

The old windows were made by Viollet-le-Duc. He made them all to look good together. He wanted them to be like the old, tall churches.

Who said the president could change the church? The church belongs to everyone, not just him.

Emmanuel Macron wants to show that Notre Dame is from the 21st century."
51,51_2,2,"Perhaps a little modesty would be preferable.” The French heritage association Sites &amp; Monuments has threatened legal action if the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows goes ahead. Rykner told the Observer: “To remove windows that survived the fire undamaged and replace them with others is just absurd. I am not against contemporary windows per se but there is just no reason to replace these windows. Besides, money donated by people to renovate Notre Dame has already been spent on cleaning them. “It’s absolutely ridiculous. We’ve been told they will put the Viollet-le-Duc windows on display in a museum. They don’t belong in a museum – they belong in Notre Dame. It makes no sense for them to be on display anywhere other than the cathedral. Their only interest is in situ.” He added: “I don’t see why Macron has such a say over what happens to a heritage building. This is just a vanity project. “As for the church authorities approving this – we should remember that the greatest vandalism done to French churches and religious buildings in the 60s and 70s was carried out … by the church. They have no taste.” Stéphane Bern, Macron’s former heritage tsar, voiced his opposition to the plan in an interview with Ouest France newspaper. “I have nothing against Claire Tabouret or contemporary stained glass ... But I am in favour of them when the old ones are destroyed or damaged. You can’t remove stained glass windows that are listed as historic monuments,” Bern said. “Why does the state set itself free from the rules it imposes on others? Just because the president wants it that way?” Simon-Marq will make the six new windows, which will reach 7m high and cover a total surface area of 121 sq metres, and are expected to be installed in 2026. Tabouret said she would be incorporating motifs from Viollet-le-Duc’s windows in the stained glass.","Some people think the plan is not good.

A French group called Sites & Monuments is angry. They might go to court. This is because of the plan to take out old windows from Notre Dame.

Mr. Rykner said it is silly to take out good windows. The fire did not hurt them. He said they want to put in new windows. He likes new windows, but he thinks these old windows should stay.

People gave money to fix Notre Dame. Some of that money was used to clean these old windows.

Mr. Rykner thinks it is wrong to move the old windows to a museum. He says they belong in the church, Notre Dame. He thinks they should stay where they are.

He does not understand why President Macron has so much power over the building. He thinks Macron wants this to show off.

The church leaders like the plan. But Mr. Rykner said the church damaged many old churches in the past. He thinks they do not have good taste.

Mr. Stéphane Bern used to work for President Macron. He also does not like the plan. He likes new glass art. But he thinks it should be used when the old glass is broken.

He said you cannot take out old glass windows that are important. He asked why the government can break its own rules. He thinks it is because the President wants it.

Ms. Simon-Marq will make the new windows. They will be very big. They will be ready in 2026.

Ms. Tabouret said the new windows will look a little like the old ones."
52,52_0,0,"I was drawn to Jonathan Freedland’s article (‘How do we live in this terrible world?’ a reader asked me. Here’s the only answer I have, 20 December), as it is a question that’s continually on my mind. There’s much substance in his well-informed piece, though the ending’s quite simple and resonates with my own take: “Perhaps by accepting that it’s the only one we have and that it’s not always so terrible – that sometimes, even quite often, it can be rather beautiful.” One of my responses to this ever-present question is to have gratitude for what I call “magic moments” in nature – like this morning catching sight of the heron, almost invisible, being so amazingly camouflaged among the reeds by a stream; I said “good morning, heron” softly, but didn’t linger because I’ve come to realise that they don’t like being looked at for long. A few years ago, I made a book of Marvellous Mundane Magic for my then 10-year-old granddaughter, to demonstrate to her that magic wasn’t solely the property of wizards. She loved it and now she’s noting her own and giving them to me to make a new book. Even a short early-morning walk offers magic if your eyes and ears are open, even if it’s just hearing a winter robin or seeing herb robert still flowering by a path. Margaret Turner Exeter • Jonathan Freedland gave us “a few reasons to be hopeful” about living in this terrible world. Thank you – they are good reasons: drawing strength from those who “dare to swim against even the bleakest tides”, celebrating what is good, and remembering that this is the only world we have, and that it is often beautiful. These reasons all involve looking outwards, observing. A complementary way of being hopeful – and happy – is looking inwards and acting on our values. Alone, or with the help of activist citizen groups. Thinking back, that is what the suffragettes did, the anti-apartheid activists and many others who have made the world a better place.","I read an article by Jonathan Freedland. It was called ""How do we live in this terrible world?"" This is a question I often think about.

His article was very good. The ending was simple. He said we should accept that this is the only world we have. He said it is not always terrible. Sometimes, it can be beautiful. I agree with this.

I try to be thankful for ""magic moments"" in nature. For example, this morning I saw a heron. It was almost hidden among the reeds. It was near a stream. I said ""good morning, heron"" quietly. I did not stay long because herons do not like to be watched.

A few years ago, I made a book for my granddaughter. She was ten years old. I called it ""Marvellous Mundane Magic."" I wanted to show her that magic is not just for wizards. She liked the book very much. Now she writes down her own magic moments. She gives them to me so I can make a new book.

Even a short walk can be magic. You just need to open your eyes and ears. You might hear a robin in winter. You might see a flower by the path.

Margaret Turner from Exeter wrote about Jonathan Freedland's article. She said he gave us ""a few reasons to be hopeful"" about living in this bad world. She thanked him. His reasons were good. He said we can be strong by looking at people who try to make things better. He said we should celebrate good things. He also said we should remember that this is the only world we have, and it is often beautiful.

These reasons are about looking at the world around us. We can also be hopeful and happy by looking inside ourselves. We can act on what we believe is important. We can do this alone, or with groups of people who want to make a change.

I remember the suffragettes. I also remember the people who fought against apartheid. They and many others made the world a better place. They acted on their values."

The board game 2045, developed by the Taiwanese company Mizo Games, invites players to participate in an imaginary Chinese invasion 20 years in the future. Players are given roles that include Taiwanese army officers, Chinese sleeper agents and volunteer citizen fighters. “We can’t predict the future, but if a conflict is unavoidable I hope this game gives people a chance to experience war on the tabletop before it reaches us,” KJ Chang, the founder of Mizo Games, told the Wall Street Journal. The game is being released at a time when China has increased its military pressure around the self-governing island. Taiwan has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China but Beijing regards it as part of its territory and has promised to “unify” it with China, using force if necessary. Observers do not know when, if ever, China will launch a military operation against Taiwan. But some analysts have pointed to the years around 2050 as a possible risk period. Xi Jinping, China’s leader and military commander-in-chief, has pledged to build a “world-class army” by the middle of the century, and 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic of China, is the date by which Beijing wants to achieve “national rejuvenation”. Mizo Games launched a crowdfunding campaign for their new product in August. Within months, it had raised NTD$4.1m (£99,468), surpassing its original target by more than 4,000%. 2045 is the latest in a series of entertainment products in Taiwan that focus on the threat of an attempted Chinese annexation. This year also saw the release of Zero Day, a Taiwanese government-funded television series that depicts a Chinese invasion. It also received support from Robert Tsao, a Taiwanese tech billionaire and supporter of Taiwan’s civil defence efforts. As well as receiving the first copies of the game, VIP backers of the crowdfunding campaign will receive extra Taiwan-themed products.","In January, families in Taiwan will celebrate Lunar New Year. At the same time, a new game will come out.

The game is called ""2045."" It is about a possible war in the future.

A company in Taiwan called Mizo Games made the game. In the game, China might invade Taiwan in 20 years.

Players can be different people in the game. They can be Taiwanese soldiers. They can also be Chinese spies or Taiwanese people who want to fight.

KJ Chang started Mizo Games. He said we don't know the future. But he hopes the game lets people learn about war. They can learn without real war happening.

China is putting more pressure on Taiwan now. Taiwan governs itself. China thinks Taiwan is part of China. China wants to join Taiwan to China, even if they have to use force.

People don't know if China will attack Taiwan. Some people think it might happen around the year 2050.

The leader of China, Xi Jinping, wants a strong army. He wants it by the middle of the century. China wants to be strong by 2049. This is the 100th birthday of China.

Mizo Games asked people for money to make the game. They asked in August. People gave them a lot of money very quickly. They got more money than they needed.

""2045"" is not the only thing in Taiwan about a possible attack from China. There is also a TV show called ""Zero Day."" It is about a Chinese invasion too. The government of Taiwan helped make the show.

Robert Tsao also helped. He is a rich man from Taiwan who supports Taiwan's defense.

54,54_0,0,"The tech entrepreneur and close adviser to Donald Trump Elon Musk has taken a stunning new public step in his support for the far-right German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), publishing a supportive guest opinion piece for the country’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that has prompted the commentary editor to resign in protest. The commentary piece in German was launched online on Saturday before being published on Sunday in the flagship paper of the Axel Springer media group, which also owns the US politics news site Politico. Musk uses populist and personal language to try to deny AfD’s extremist bent, and the essay expands on his post on his social media platform, X, on which he last week claimed that “only the AfD can save Germany”. Translated, Musk’s piece said: “The portrayal of the AfD as rightwing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has classified the AfD at the national level as a suspected extremism case since 2021. Shortly after the piece was published online, the editor of the opinion section, Eva Marie Kogel, used the US tech mogul’s own platform to post on X that she had submitted her resignation. “I always enjoyed heading the opinion department at Welt and Wams. Today a text by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. Yesterday I submitted my resignation after printing,” she posted. She included a link to the Musk commentary article. The AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance and, like incoming president Donald Trump in relation to the US, is calling for mass deportations from Germany. Earlier in December, Musk not only posted in favor of AfD but the party’s hard line on immigration appeared to resonate with the incoming US vice-president, JD Vance, MSNBC reported. Senior Welt Group figures weighed in on Saturday. “Democracy and journalism thrive on freedom of expression.","Elon Musk is a tech boss and helps Donald Trump. He has done something new that supports a German political party. This party is called Alternative for Germany (AfD).

Musk wrote an article for a German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag. The editor of the newspaper's opinion section did not like this. She quit her job because of Musk's article.

The article was in German. It was online on Saturday and in the newspaper on Sunday. The newspaper is owned by a big media company. This company also owns the news site Politico.

Musk wrote that AfD is not extreme. He said Alice Weidel, the leader of AfD, has a partner who is from Sri Lanka. Her partner is also the same sex as her. Musk asked if this sounds like Hitler.

Germany's intelligence agency thinks AfD might be extremist. They have been watching AfD since 2021.

Eva Marie Kogel was the editor of the opinion section. She used Musk's social media site, X, to say she quit. She said she liked her job, but she resigned after Musk's article was printed. She shared a link to Musk's article.

AfD does not want many immigrants in Germany. They want to send many people out of Germany. Donald Trump wants to do something similar in the US.

In December, Musk said he liked AfD. JD Vance, who might be the next US vice-president, seemed to agree with AfD about immigration.

Some important people at the Welt Group talked about the situation on Saturday. They said freedom of speech is important for democracy and journalism."

They said discussion about Musk’s piece, which had about 340 comments several hours after it was published, was “very revealing”. Underneath Musk’s commentary, the newspaper published a response by Burgard. “Musk’s diagnosis is correct, but his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally false,” he wrote, referencing the AfD’s desire to leave the European Union and seek rapprochement with Russia as well as appease China. Musk and Weidel both later posted a link to the article on X. The AfD backing from Musk, who also defended his right to weigh in on German politics due to his “significant investments”, comes as Germans are set to vote on 23 February after a coalition government led by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed late this fall. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a centre-right or centre-left majority, but Germany’s mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level.","The new leaders of a newspaper told Reuters about a story about Elon Musk. The leaders are Jan Philipp Burgard and Ulf Poschardt. Jan Philipp Burgard will be the editor. Ulf Poschardt will be the publisher. He starts on January 1.

The story about Musk had many comments. The leaders said the discussion about the story showed a lot.

The newspaper also printed a reply from Burgard after Musk's words. Burgard said Musk was right about a problem. But Burgard said Musk's idea for fixing it was wrong. Musk thought the AfD party could save Germany. Burgard said this was not right. He mentioned the AfD wants to leave the European Union and be friendly with Russia and China.

Musk and Alice Weidel later shared a link to the story on X.

Musk said he can talk about German politics. He said he has a lot of money invested there. The AfD party has Musk's support.

Germans will vote on February 23. The government of Olaf Scholz ended recently. The AfD party is doing well in the polls. They might stop the center-right or center-left from winning. But the main parties in Germany said they will not work with the AfD."
55,55_0,0,"Dominique Pelicot will not appeal against his conviction for drugging and raping his wife and inviting strangers to rape her, his lawyer has said. Béatrice Zavarro said the former electrician, 72, who was jailed for the maximum 20 years this month, wished to spare his now ex-wife, Gisèle Pelicot, a new ordeal but admitted there was also the risk a new trial in front of a public jury could mean a longer prison sentence. Pelicot and the 50 others who were all found guilty of rape or sexual assault after a three-and-a-half-month trial have until midnight on Monday to lodge an appeal. A statement from public prosecutor confirmed that 17 people had so far appealed against their convictions, adding that a new trial would be held in Nîmes towards the end of next year. Gisèle Pelicot, 72, a retired logistics manager, believes she may have been raped more than 200 times by her husband and other men between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after filming up the skirts of female shoppers in a supermarket near the couple’s home in the Provençal town of Mazan. Detectives subsequently found tens of thousands of videos of the abuse on his phone and a hard drive. On Monday, Zavarro said Dominique Pelicot had decided not to appeal against his conviction because to do so would “force Gisèle into a new ordeal and new confrontations, which [he] rejects”. Appealing against the guilty judgment, when Pelicot admitted the charges, would involve “running an unnecessary risk”, she added, as the accusations could be made more serious in the appeal court, where the case would be held in front of a public jury, potentially leading to a longer prison term. “It is time to put an end to this judicially,” Zavarro said on Monday. The marathon rape trial in Avignon was heard by a panel of five professional magistrates. The appeal court, which sits in the southern city of Nîmes, will require a new full trial within the next year. Gisèle Pelicot is not required to attend the appeal hearing but her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, indicated she was ready to do so.","Dominique Pelicot was found guilty. He drugged and hurt his wife. He also invited strangers to hurt her. His lawyer said he will not ask for a new trial.

The man, who is 72 years old, used to work as an electrician. He was sent to prison for 20 years. This is the longest time he could be in prison for his crimes.

His lawyer, Béatrice Zavarro, said that Dominique does not want to cause more pain to his ex-wife, Gisèle Pelicot. She also said that if there was a new trial, he could get an even longer prison sentence.

Dominique and 50 other people were found guilty. They hurt Gisèle. The trial lasted for three and a half months. They have until Monday night to ask for a new trial.

A statement said that 17 people have asked for a new trial. The new trial will be in Nîmes next year.

Gisèle Pelicot is also 72 years old. She used to work as a manager. She thinks she was hurt more than 200 times by her husband and other men. This happened between 2011 and 2020.

Dominique was caught when he took videos of women in a shop. This shop was near their home in Mazan. Mazan is a town in France.

The police found many videos on his phone. The videos showed the abuse.

On Monday, Béatrice Zavarro said that Dominique decided not to ask for a new trial. He does not want to make Gisèle suffer again. He also does not want to risk a longer prison time.

She said that if he asked for a new trial, the case could become more serious. This is because the new trial would be in front of a jury. A jury is a group of people who decide if someone is guilty. If the jury thinks he is very guilty, he could stay in prison longer.

Béatrice Zavarro said it is time for the case to end.

The first trial was in Avignon. Five judges listened to the case. The new trial in Nîmes will take place next year.

Gisèle does not have to go to the new trial. But her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, said she is ready to go if she needs to."
55,55_1,1,"“She has told us she will be there. Maybe not every day but she says she will go,” he said. She became an international feminist figurehead after insisting the trial be held in open court and the videos of her abuse shown in order that “shame changes sides”. The trial has caused much soul-searcing in France and calls to tighten French rape laws, including introducing the concept of “consent”, which is absent. The trial also threw a spotlight on attitudes towards the rape and sexual abuse of women in France, where 94% of reported rape cases are dropped without any action. “From Gisèle Pelicot’s point of view, there is no sentence that will give her back what she has lost,” Babonneau said. “All Gisèle Pelicot wanted is to have the accused convicted for what they did to her. As for the personal sentences, she respects the decision of the court and finds no solace in them.”","He told us that she will be there. Maybe she will not be there every day. But she said she will go.

She is now a famous feminist around the world. This is because she wanted her trial to be public. She wanted everyone to see the videos of what happened to her. She wanted the shame to be on the abusers, not on her.

The trial made people in France think a lot. People want to change the laws about rape in France. They want to add the idea of ""consent"" to the laws. ""Consent"" means saying yes to something. This idea is not in the French laws now.

The trial also showed how people in France think about rape and abuse of women. Many rape cases in France are stopped. About 94 out of 100 reported rape cases are stopped without anything happening.

Babonneau said that Gisèle Pelicot will never get back what she lost. No punishment can do that. Gisèle Pelicot just wanted the people who hurt her to be found guilty. She respects the court's decision about the punishments. But the punishments do not make her feel better."
56,56_0,0,"Work has begun to conserve and digitise one of the oldest paper documents still in existence on the island of Ireland. The ecclesiastical register, which dates back to the medieval period, is about 650 years old. It belonged to the former archbishop of Armagh Milo Sweteman. Its delicate pages are being repaired by experts at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni) as part of an initiative to rejuvenate and preserve some of the island of Ireland’s most important historical texts. Ecclesiastical registers contain copies or drafts of documents created by the archbishops’ administration work, including legal papers, official letters, correspondence, receipts and wills. The register belonging to Sweteman dates to his time in the senior clerical role from 1361 to 1380. Conservation work on the register of archbishop John Swayne, dated from 1418 to 1438, has already been completed and a digitised copy, along with a translated summary, are now available online. The conservation work on the Swayne books involved carefully detaching bindings dating from the 17th century, gently washing all the paper folios and then consolidating each piece of paper with a weak gelatine solution. Tears and losses in the paper were infilled with Japanese kozo paper before the books were rebound using 17th-century binding material. The work now under way on the Sweteman register involves the need to repair damage that resulted from previous conservation efforts dating back to the start of the 20th century when tracing paper was placed on the pages in an attempt to preserve them. The tracing paper was acidic and actually accelerated the corrosion of the ink and paper. It is now being removed using a specialist gel before being subjected to a low-pressure washing process. The same kozo paper and wheat starch paste repairs used for Swayne’s register are then being undertaken. Similar work is being carried out on a third register, dated between 1400 and 1418, that belonged to former archbishop Nicholas Fleming. Sarah Graham, head of conservation at Proni, explained that paper was extremely rare on the island of Ireland when the registers were compiled.","Work has started on an old paper document. This document is very old. It is one of the oldest paper documents in Ireland.

The document is about 650 years old. It is from the Middle Ages. It was owned by Milo Sweteman. He was an archbishop in Armagh.

The pages of the document are very delicate. Experts are fixing them. They work at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni). They are helping to save important old documents from Ireland.

These documents are called ecclesiastical registers. They have copies of papers from the archbishop. These papers include legal papers and letters. They also include receipts and wills.

Sweteman's register is from when he was archbishop. He was the archbishop from 1361 to 1380.

The experts already fixed another register. This register belonged to archbishop John Swayne. It is from 1418 to 1438. You can now see it online. There is also a simple explanation of it.

To fix Swayne's register, they took it apart. They cleaned each page with water. Then, they put a special liquid on the paper. This made the paper stronger. They fixed tears with special paper from Japan. Then, they put the book back together with old covers.

Now, they are working on Sweteman's register. They need to fix damage from before. People tried to save it a long time ago. They put thin paper on the pages. But this thin paper was bad for the document. It made the ink and paper get worse.

The experts are taking off the thin paper. They are using a special gel. Then, they will wash the pages gently. They will use the same Japanese paper and glue to fix it like they did for Swayne's register.

They are also working on a third register. This register belonged to archbishop Nicholas Fleming. It is from 1400 to 1418.

Sarah Graham works at Proni. She said that paper was rare in Ireland when these registers were made."
56,56_1,1,"It was a period that just predated the invention of the printing press when parchment from animal skins was still the preferred writing material. “Paper that pre-dates 1450 is particularly rare, it didn’t occur in Ireland for a couple of centuries after the register of Milo Sweteman or the register of John Swayne were completed,” said Graham. “We’ve done some research into the watermarks and know that the paper came from Italy and from Spain.” Graham said it was likely the archbishops imported the paper to Ireland during their travels around Europe. The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland is an effort to partially recreate the rich historical archive that was destroyed when the Public Record Office of Ireland in Dublin was set alight in June 1922 in the beginning of the Irish civil war. Graham emphasised the importance of preserving the centuries-old documents that do still exist. “The work that we do in conservation more broadly is really important to stabilise the collections so that they’re available to the public now, but they’re also available for generations to come, so that future generations are able to understand where they come from, what their history is, and the primary source of material is here and available to them,” she said.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

A long time ago, before people had printing presses, they wrote on animal skin. This animal skin was called parchment. Paper from before 1450 is very hard to find.

Graham said that paper like this did not come to Ireland for a long time. It came after two books were made. These books were called the register of Milo Sweteman and the register of John Swayne.

""We looked at the marks on the paper,"" said Graham. ""We learned that the paper came from Italy and Spain.""

Graham thinks that the archbishops brought the paper to Ireland. They probably got it when they traveled around Europe.

The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland is trying to make a copy of old records. These records were lost when a building in Dublin burned down. This building was called the Public Record Office of Ireland. It burned in June 1922, at the start of the Irish civil war.

Graham said it is important to keep the old papers that we still have.

""We need to take care of these old papers,"" she said. ""This will help people today see them. It will also help people in the future. They can learn about their history. They can see the old papers themselves."""
57,57_0,0,"South Korea’s intelligence agency has reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine has died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces. Seoul’s spy agency earlier on Friday confirmed Ukrainian reports that an injured North Korean soldier had been captured by Ukrainian forces, in what was likely to have been the first capture of its kind since Pyongyang sent combat forces to bolster Russian forces in the war. The South Korean national intelligence service said in a statement: “Through real-time information sharing with an allied country’s intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured.” The agency later said the captured soldier had died from his injuries. A photo of the soldier, who looked gaunt and appeared to have been injured, circulated on the Telegram messaging app, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. In his nightly video address on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said North Korean troops fighting in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s president said Russian troops were doing everything to ensure that North Korean soldiers were not taken prisoner by Kyiv. He said some North Korean soldiers had been captured by Ukrainian forces, but were hurt so badly they could not be saved. Earlier the Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that special forces had captured the soldier in the Kursk region, where Ukraine has seized and held some territory. The outlet did not say when the capture took place, and there has been no confirmation from officials in Ukraine or North Korea, where the state media have not referred to the deployment of the country’s troops. Militarnyi said that if it was confirmed, the soldier would be the first North Korean combatant to have been taken by Ukrainian forces. As many as 11,000 soldiers from North Korea have been deployed to help Russia, months after Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defence pact that committed each country to come to the other’s aid if attacked. While the North could gain valuable battlefield experience, its poorly trained soldiers, fighting in unfamiliar territory, have quickly been exposed to the dangers of combat.","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR B1 level:

South Korea has an intelligence agency. This agency said a North Korean soldier has died. This soldier was fighting in Ukraine. He was captured by Ukrainian soldiers.

The South Korean agency said this on Friday. They knew this from reports from Ukraine. The North Korean soldier was hurt. Then, Ukrainian soldiers captured him. This may be the first time this has happened. North Korea sent soldiers to help Russia in the war.

The South Korean agency said they got information from another country's intelligence agency. They learned that a North Korean soldier was hurt and captured. Later, the agency said the soldier died from his injuries.

A picture of the soldier was shared online. He looked thin and hurt. This was reported by Yonhap, a news agency in South Korea.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the president of Ukraine. He spoke in a video. He said North Korean soldiers are fighting in the Kursk region of Russia. They are losing many soldiers. Russia is not protecting them well.

The Ukrainian president said Russian soldiers do not want North Korean soldiers to be captured. Some North Korean soldiers were captured, but they were very badly hurt. They could not be saved.

The Ukrainian website Militarnyi said special forces captured the soldier. This happened in the Kursk region. Ukraine has taken some land there. The website did not say when the soldier was captured.

No one in Ukraine or North Korea has said this is true. North Korean news has not talked about sending soldiers. Militarnyi said if this is true, the soldier is the first North Korean soldier captured in the war.

About 11,000 soldiers from North Korea are helping Russia. Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin made an agreement. They said they would help each other if attacked. This was months ago.

North Korean soldiers might get good experience fighting. But they are not well trained. They are fighting in a place they do not know. This is dangerous for them."
57,57_1,1,"Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, known as the GUR, said on Thursday that North Korean troops were suffering heavy losses in the fighting in Kursk and facing logistical difficulties as a result of Ukrainian attacks. The GUR said Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka had inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units and that North Korean troops also faced supply issues, including shortages of drinking water. This week Zelenskyy claimed that more than 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in the Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties. On Friday a White House spokesperson said 1,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the past week alone. “It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences,” John Kirby said. He described the North Korean troops’ offensive as “massed, dismounted assaults” and said Joe Biden was likely to approve another security assistance package for Ukraine in coming days. The deployment of North Korean soldiers marked a dramatic escalation in the war, which began almost three years ago, as the Kremlin turned to its ally to boost its forces. It was also seen as an attempt by Putin to broaden the conflict through the direct involvement in fighting of a third country. Slovakia, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that it would host peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, despite Ukraine’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Putin. On Thursday the Russian president said it was “acceptable” for the country to become a “platform” for dialogue over the conflict, which the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said he could end after he takes office in January. That prospect has raised concerns in Kyiv that a settlement could be imposed on terms favourable to Moscow, as Ukraine struggles on the battlefield.","Here is the text rewritten to CEFR B1 level:

Ukraine has a military spy group. It is called GUR. The GUR said on Thursday that North Korean soldiers are dying a lot in Kursk. They also have problems getting supplies. This is because Ukraine is attacking them.

The GUR said Ukraine attacked near Novoivanovka. Many North Korean soldiers died or were hurt. North Korean soldiers also do not have enough water and other things.

This week, Zelenskyy said that over 3,000 North Korean soldiers have died or were hurt in Kursk. This is the first time Ukraine has said how many North Korean soldiers have died.

On Friday, a person from the White House said that 1,000 North Korean soldiers died or were hurt in Kursk this week.

John Kirby said that Russia and North Korea do not care about these soldiers. They are sending them to attack, but they cannot win against Ukraine.

He said the North Korean soldiers are attacking in big groups, but they are not using vehicles. Joe Biden may send more help to Ukraine soon.

North Korea sending soldiers is a big change in the war. The war started almost three years ago. Russia asked North Korea to help because they need more soldiers.

People think Putin wants to make the war bigger. He wants another country to fight in the war too.

Slovakia said on Friday that they will have peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. But Ukraine thinks Slovakia is helping Putin.

On Thursday, the Russian president said that Slovakia can be a place to talk about the war. Donald Trump will become the US president in January. He said he can end the war.

This makes Ukraine worried. They think Russia might get a good deal, but it will be bad for Ukraine. Ukraine is having a hard time fighting."
58,58_0,0,"At first, there seemed nothing to be afraid of. Joe Giardina, his wife, Evanna, and their 16-year-old son, Paul, were taking in the picture-perfect waters of Patong bay as they ate breakfast in their Phuket beachfront hotel on Boxing Day morning in 2004. “We were admiring the view and all of a sudden the water disappeared,” says Giardina, 67, speaking from his home in Rosanna, Victoria. The water level had dropped so quickly that fish were floundering on the exposed seabed. But rather than sensing any threat, curious onlookers made their way to the beach. “The locals thought, ‘This is fantastic.’ They were running around picking the fish up.” Now Giardina knows it’s a sign to flee to higher ground. About 550km to the south-west, a magnitude 9.15 earthquake had struck 30km below the Andaman Sea, triggering what would become the most devastating tsunami in history. Paul was one of 26 Australians among more than 230,000 people whose lives were lost across 14 countries – in some impact zones, the waves reached up to 3o metres above sea level. Twenty years on, Giardina’s memories of the disaster are as vivid as they were in its immediate aftermath. “It really feels like it was only yesterday,” he says of that initially deceptive morning. Within about half an hour the sea had returned to its normal level and settled, then it began to swirl, gently stirring up the sand below. Almost simultaneously, the nearby pier started to float away. A small amount of water – no more than 20cm – washed on to the road bordering the restaurant. “It didn’t look dangerous – we said, ‘We’re going to get wet,’” Giardina remembers. But when a car was washed towards the hotel, he began to run, leading Paul by the hand and then attempting to protect his son by holding him against a pillar inside the hotel. Seconds later, a waist-high wall of water hit them from behind, throwing them over an internal wall and ripping Giardina’s clothes from his body.","Joe Giardina, his wife Evanna, and their son Paul were on holiday. Paul was 16 years old. They were in Phuket, in Thailand. It was December 26, 2004. They were eating breakfast at their hotel. The hotel was on the beach in Patong bay.

Everything seemed fine. The sea looked beautiful. Then, something strange happened. Joe said, ""We were looking at the view. Suddenly, the water went away."" The water went down very fast. Fish were left on the sand. People were surprised. They went to the beach to look.

Joe said, ""The people who lived there thought it was good. They were picking up the fish."" Now Joe knows this was a warning. He knows it meant they should go to higher ground.

Far away, about 550 km, there was a big earthquake. It was under the sea. The earthquake was very strong. It caused a tsunami. A tsunami is a very big wave. This tsunami was the worst one ever.

Paul died in the tsunami. He was one of 26 Australians who died. More than 230,000 people died in 14 countries. The waves were very high in some places, up to 30 meters.

Joe remembers the tsunami very well. It has been 20 years, but he still remembers it clearly. He said, ""It feels like it was yesterday.""

That morning, the sea looked normal again after the water went away. Then the water started to move around. It moved the sand. Then, the pier near them started to float away. A little water came onto the road. It was not very high. It was about 20 cm. Joe said, ""It did not look dangerous. We thought we would just get wet.""

But then, a car was pushed by the water towards the hotel. Joe knew they had to run. He took Paul's hand and ran. They went inside the hotel. Joe tried to keep Paul safe near a pillar. Then, a big wave of water hit them. It was very strong. It threw them over a wall. The water even pulled Joe's clothes off."
58,58_1,1,"Cars and tables slammed into the building as everything in the path of the 800km/h wave was lifted and flung high. Something hit Giardina on the back of the head and he went under, losing hold of Paul. Giardina found himself pushed horizontally against the outer corner of the hotel when a large object – a car, a fridge, he’ll never know – pinned his left arm to the wall. “I’m trying with my right hand to get out, get around the corner, to push away whatever was holding me. And I just couldn’t get there. I was underwater and I held my breath for as long as I could. The last thing I recall is just opening my mouth and that was it. The lights went off.” Today, he still finds consolation in the thought that Paul, whose body was found in a makeshift morgue by Joe’s brothers-in-law three days later, might have experienced something similar. “I can only hope – and it’s terrible – but I can only hope that Paul went through the same experience,” he says. “There was no suffering.” The Giardinas had weighed up whether to visit Thailand or Bali for Paul’s first overseas trip. Paul had Down’s syndrome and, while physically high-functioning, was unable to care for himself. Phuket seemed a safer option two years after Bali’s terrorist attacks and the family – Paul’s sister, two years his senior, stayed in Australia – chose to celebrate Christmas at Patong’s Seaview hotel, where Paul played ball in the swimming pool and was photographed smiling with Santa. Joe and Evanna called their affectionate son the “love machine”. “Twice in his short life, he had open heart surgery. The second time, he’d had a valve replaced in his heart, and when he’s woken up from the surgery, what was his first comment? It wasn’t tears and crying and screaming, it was ‘What happened?’ There wouldn’t be too many of us behaving that way,” Joe Giardina says, laughing. Giardina was found inside the hotel, lying prone and headfirst down a flight of steps on the third storey.","The very fast wave was like a strong wind. It was going 800 kilometers per hour. It picked up cars and tables. It threw them into the building.

Something hit Giardina on his head. He fell down and lost his grip on Paul.

Giardina was pushed against the hotel wall. A big thing pinned his arm. It could have been a car or a fridge. He did not know.

He tried to move away with his other hand. He could not. He was underwater. He held his breath.

He opened his mouth. Then he lost consciousness. Everything went dark.

Later, Paul's body was found. Joe's family found him after three days.

Giardina hopes Paul did not suffer. He hopes Paul had a similar experience. He thinks there was no pain for Paul.

The Giardinas wanted to take Paul on a trip. They thought about Thailand or Bali. Paul had Down's syndrome. He needed help to take care of himself.

They chose Phuket because it seemed safer. It was two years after the Bali attacks.

The family stayed at the Seaview hotel. Paul played with a ball in the pool. He took a picture with Santa. His sister stayed in Australia.

Joe and Evanna loved their son very much. They called him the ""love machine.""

Paul had two heart surgeries. After the second surgery, he woke up. He did not cry. He asked, ""What happened?"" Joe Giardina laughed when he remembered this.

Giardina was found inside the hotel. He was lying on the stairs. His head was down. He was on the third floor."
58,58_2,2,"His position saved his life: water drained out of his body. Initially deemed unlikely to survive, he was eventually taken to Bangkok hospital in Phuket, where the pain from his extensive injuries was numbed by the fear that he had lost Paul and Evanna. His wife was found unhurt and later reunited with him – she had ridden the wave to the hotel, grabbed hold of a balcony and miraculously avoided being sucked back out to sea. When Giardina was medevaced to Melbourne, the doctors’ first job was to flush the sand out of his lungs. “The one thing that it has taught me is how quickly it can all come to an end. You appreciate every day when you go through something like that,” he says, describing the speed at which the morning went from one of tropical calm to earth-shattering calamity. He and Evanna are grateful to have found Paul’s body among Thailand’s 5,400 victims, “because if we hadn’t, I know that there would be a sense of ‘He could be out there still’. And where do you start? We would have been walking the streets looking for him. And that would have been …” He pauses. “How do you cope with that?” It’s not accidental that when visitors to the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial take in the wave-shaped sculpture on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, they are also facing the water. Giardina instigated the memorial and requested that its aspect include water. Its unveiling in December 2015 was the first time Joe and Evanna had met all 25 of the other Australian victims’ families, after a 10-year process involving three governments. It’s given them a place where they can remember Paul, and this 26 December they plan to be there again, with their son in spirit. But part of Paul will always remain in Phuket. Joe and Evanna returned to Patong in October 2005 and again on the first anniversary of the disaster, and Joe has visited Thailand many times since, partly so that the tsunami does not dictate how he lives. “It’s part of the healing. I feel like part of Paul is there. If I didn’t go back, the tsunami would win.","He was in a certain place, and this helped him stay alive. The water went out of his body. At first, people did not think he would live. But he went to a hospital in Phuket, Thailand. The hospital was in Bangkok. He was in a lot of pain because he had many injuries. But he was also worried about Paul and Evanna. He thought they might be dead.

His wife, Evanna, was okay. She was not hurt. She was with him again later. She was on the wave, but she got to the hotel. She held onto a balcony. She was lucky and did not go back into the sea.

Joe was taken to Melbourne by plane to get medical help. Doctors cleaned the sand out of his lungs. Joe said that this event showed him how fast things can change. He said he is thankful for every day because of what happened. That morning, it was calm and nice. Then, very quickly, everything became terrible.

Joe and Evanna are happy that they found Paul's body. Many people died in Thailand, about 5,400. They are happy they found Paul because if they had not, they would think he might still be alive. They would not know where to look for him. They would be looking for him on the streets. Joe said it would be very hard to deal with that.

There is a special place in Canberra to remember the tsunami. It is called the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial. It has a statue that looks like a wave. The statue faces the water. Joe made this memorial happen. He wanted it to face the water.

The memorial opened in December 2015. It was the first time Joe and Evanna met the families of the other Australians who died. There were 25 other families. It took 10 years to build the memorial. Three different groups of people in the government helped.

The memorial is a place where they can remember Paul. They will go there on December 26th. They will remember Paul.

But part of Paul will always be in Phuket. Joe and Evanna went back to Patong in October 2005. They also went back on the first year that they remember the tsunami. Joe has gone to Thailand many times since then. He goes so the tsunami does not control his life. He says it helps him feel better. He feels like part of Paul is there.

59,59_0,0,"The United Nations chief has denounced the “escalation” in hostilities between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Israel, calling IDF strikes on targets including at the airport in Sana’a “especially alarming” after it came under attack while the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane. Israel struck multiple targets linked to the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen on Thursday, including the international airport in the capital, Sana’a. Houthi media said at least six people were killed. A spokesperson for UN secretary general, António Guterres, said in a statement: “The secretary general condemns the escalation between Yemen and Israel. Israeli airstrikes today on Sana’a international airport, the Red Sea ports and power stations in Yemen are especially alarming … “Today’s airstrikes follow around a year of escalatory actions by the Houthis in the Red Sea and the region that threaten civilians, regional stability and freedom of maritime navigation.” The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a social media post on Thursday that he was about to board a plane at the airport when it came under aerial attack. A crew member on the plane was injured, he said, and at least two people were reported killed at the airport. “The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave. My UN and @WHO colleagues and I are safe. Our heartfelt condolences to the families whose loved ones lost their lives in the attack.” Tedros said he had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of UN staff detained by the Houthis and assess the humanitarian situation. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Agence France-Presse on whether they were aware of Tedros’ presence at the time. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Thursday afternoon that Israel’s air force attacked Houthi targets on the coastline and in Sanaa, adding: “We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran’s evil axis.","The leader of the United Nations is worried. The fighting between the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Israel is getting worse. This is called an ""escalation.""

Israel attacked some places in Yemen. These places included the airport in Sana'a. Sana'a is the capital city of Yemen. The UN leader said these attacks are very worrying.

The attacks happened when the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) was at the airport. He was going to get on a plane.

Israel attacked the Houthi group in Yemen on Thursday. The Houthi group is helped by Iran. The airport in Sana'a was one of the places attacked.

Houthi news said that at least six people died.

A spokesperson for the UN leader, António Guterres, said something about this. He said that the UN leader is against the fighting getting worse. He said the attacks on the airport, the ports on the Red Sea, and power stations are very worrying.

The spokesperson also said that the Houthi group has been doing things that make the situation worse for about a year. These actions put people in danger. They also cause problems for the area and for ships that need to travel safely.

The head of the WHO is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He said he was at the airport when it was attacked. He wrote about it on social media.

He said a person who worked on the plane was hurt. He also said that at least two people died at the airport.

He said the control tower, the waiting area, and the runway were damaged. These places were near where he was. He said they must wait for the airport to be fixed before they can leave. He and his UN and WHO friends are safe. He feels sad for the families who lost people in the attack.

Tedros said he was in Yemen to talk about getting UN workers released. The Houthi group was keeping them. He also wanted to see how people in Yemen are doing.

The Israeli military did not say if they knew Tedros was at the airport when they attacked.

The leader of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, said something on Thursday. He said Israel's air force attacked Houthi places on the coast and in Sanaa. He said they want to stop the Houthi group because they are terrorists and work with Iran."
59,59_1,1,"We will persist in this until we complete the task.” Netanyahu said in an interview with Channel 14 that Israel was only at the beginning of its campaign against the Houthis. “We are just getting started with them,” he said. Houthis have repeatedly fired drones and missiles towards Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli military said that in addition to striking the airport, it also hit military infrastructure at the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib on Yemen’s west coast. It also attacked the country’s Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations. The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency said that three people were killed in the strikes on the airport and three were killed in Hodeidah, while 40 others were wounded in the attacks. Later on Thursday, the Houthis said they were ready to respond quickly to the attack and meet “escalation with escalation”, Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported. The Houthi transport minister told Saba that both the airport and Hodeidah port would resume normal operations from Friday. More than a year of Houthi attacks has disrupted international shipping routes, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys that have in turn stoked fears over global inflation. The UN security council is due to meet on Monday over the Houthi attacks on Israel, Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel’s military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR level B1:

Netanyahu said they will keep going. They will keep going until the task is done. He said this in an interview. He was talking to Channel 14. He said Israel is just starting its fight against the Houthis.

He said, ""We are just getting started with them.""

The Houthis have fired drones and missiles at Israel many times. They say they are helping the Palestinians in Gaza.

The Israeli army said they attacked the airport. They also attacked military buildings at the ports. These ports are Hodeidah, Salif, and Ras Kanatib. They are on the west coast of Yemen. They also attacked power stations in Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib.

The Saba news agency is controlled by the Houthis. They said three people died at the airport. Three people died in Hodeidah. Forty other people were hurt in the attacks.

Later, the Houthis said they are ready to fight back quickly. They said they will make the fight bigger. They told this to Al Masirah TV, which they control.

The Houthi transport minister spoke to Saba. He said the airport and Hodeidah port will open again on Friday.

The Houthis have attacked ships for over a year. This has made problems for ships around the world. The ships have to go a longer way. This costs more money. People are worried that things will cost more in the shops because of this.

The UN Security Council will meet on Monday. They will talk about the Houthi attacks on Israel. Danny Danon, Israel's UN ambassador, said this on Wednesday.

On Saturday, Israel's army did not stop a missile from Yemen. The missile fell in Tel Aviv-Jaffa. Fourteen people were hurt.

60,60_0,0,"Paul Volcker, who has died aged 92, was the most eminent financial statesman of his generation, the sworn enemy of the abuse of finance in any of its manifestations. That could be indulging inflation as the financial outcome of governments and society living beyond their means, or investment banks deluding themselves they had uncovered the alchemy of risk-free lending through the issuance of ever more complex financial derivatives. His twin mantras were that finance should be the servant not the master of economy and society. And that good government is an indispensable component of a good society, in particular keeping the temptations of clever-clever finance at bay. Sound money and good government went hand in hand. He practised what he preached, seizing the opportunity to embody his beliefs when the moment arrived. Standing over 6ft 7in, and a lover of over-sized cigars and fly-fishing, he represented the best of New England liberalism – genial, good humoured and steely. From August 1979 to August 1987 he was chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the US’s central bank, appointed by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and and reappointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. In the early part of that period he crushed inflation out of the US economy. Just 18 months after he was appointed he had the courage to raise interest rates to 20% – a rate never seen before – prompting mass protests as the US economy plunged into recession. But he held firm and succeeded, inflation peaking at 14.8% before falling back to 3% by 1983. The foundations had been laid for sustained economic recovery and in the process warranting the principle that central bank independence is a crucial precondition for robust monetary policy. It was one of the defining moments in US monetary policy history, winning him plaudits not only for his resilience in the face of near universal criticism but also from the small but fast growing influential band of free market, “monetarist” economists who believed that control of the money supply using high interest rates was the sole means to curb inflation – not any kind of government interference into the market processes for setting wages and prices. Volcker temporarily was their hero. But they misjudged the man.","Paul Volcker died. He was 92 years old. He was a very important person in the world of money. He did not like it when money was used in the wrong way.

He thought it was wrong when governments spent too much money. This can cause prices to go up, which is called inflation. He also did not like it when banks tried to make money by taking big risks.

He believed that money should help people and the economy. Money should not be in control. He also thought that good government was important. A good government should stop people from being too clever with money. He believed that good money and good government should work together.

He did what he believed was right. He was a tall man who liked big cigars and fishing. He was a kind and strong person.

From 1979 to 1987, he was in charge of the US Federal Reserve. This is the central bank of the United States. President Jimmy Carter and President Ronald Reagan chose him for this job.

At that time, prices were going up very fast in the US. It was a big problem. Volcker stopped this inflation.

He raised interest rates very high. This made it more expensive to borrow money. Some people did not like this. The economy got worse for a short time.

But Volcker did not change his mind. He kept the interest rates high. Finally, the prices stopped going up so fast. Inflation went down from almost 15% to 3%.

This helped the economy to get better. It also showed that central banks need to be independent. This means they should not be controlled by the government. This is important for making good decisions about money.

It was a very important time for money in the US. People praised Volcker for being strong. Some economists also liked him. These economists thought that high interest rates were the best way to stop inflation. They did not want the government to control prices and wages. For a while, Volcker was their hero. But they were wrong about him."
60,60_1,1,"Volcker never bought the proposition that the market was magical or that there could be a systematic relationship between the growth of the money supply and inflation. Rather he was intuitively suspicious of the short term and predatory instincts of most financial market participants, which lead to volatile and unpredictable market movements, and intuitively suspicious of the mania for dismantling the New Deal rules and regulations that restrained their worst types of behaviours that “free market“ economists said were inhibiting the efficiency of the US financial system. His willingness to be austere in raising interest rates so high was because he knew dear money worked reliably in squeezing inflation – not because he was an advocate of a hyper-free-market economy. He would be equally austere in resisting the siren calls to deregulate finance in the name of freeing up the market. It would come to no good. Nor did it. Volcker was a critic of successive rounds of financial deregulation after he left office, saying that the only useful financial innovation he had encountered was the invention of the ATM – cash dispensing machines. Even before the 2008-09 financial crisis he was warning that the invention of mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps were inherently unstable, in effect transferring risk to the Federal Reserve, which would be compelled to underwrite the financial system if the markets ever lost confidence in them. So it proved as the financial crisis broke for precisely the reasons about which he had warned – unlike his successor Alan Greenspan, who had enthusiastically and uncritically embraced financial deregulation. President Obama appointed him head of the president’s economic advisory board in 2009 in the midst of the crisis. There he argued that the emergence of banks that were too big to fail, so forcing central bank rescues, was morally and economically insupportable and they should be broken up. If that was politically impossible then at least commercial banks who took deposits from the ordinary public should be banned from trading in high-risk financial derivatives on their own account – the so-called Volcker rule. Obama adopted the proposal and it became section 619 of the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act; banks cannot own, invest in or sponsor hedge funds, private equity funds or other trading operations for their own use.","Paul Volcker did not think the market was perfect. He did not think that more money always meant more inflation. He did not trust people in the financial market. He thought they were often greedy and made the market go up and down quickly.

Volcker did not like the idea of getting rid of rules from the New Deal. These rules controlled bad actions in the market. Some economists thought these rules stopped the market from working well.

Volcker raised interest rates very high. He knew this would stop inflation. He did not want a completely free market. He also did not want to remove rules about money. He thought it was a bad idea. And he was right.

After Volcker left his job, he said that getting rid of financial rules was bad. He said the only good new thing in finance was the ATM.

Before 2008, Volcker warned about new types of investments. These were things like mortgage-backed securities. He said they were not safe. He thought they gave risk to the Federal Reserve bank. The Federal Reserve would have to help if people lost trust in these investments.

This happened in the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis happened because of the things Volcker had warned about. Alan Greenspan, who came after Volcker, had liked the idea of getting rid of financial rules.

In 2009, President Obama asked Volcker to help with the crisis. Volcker said that some banks were too big. If they failed, the government would have to save them. He said this was not fair. He thought these banks should be made smaller.

If that was not possible, Volcker said that banks should not be allowed to trade risky things. These banks took money from normal people. This idea was called the ""Volcker rule"".

Obama liked this idea. It became a rule in 2010. Now, banks cannot own or invest in some risky funds for their own profit."
60,60_2,2,"Volcker had once again made an indelible mark on the US financial system, and influenced British thinking in the legal obligation to ringfence commercial and investment bank operations. Born in Cape May, on the southern tip of New Jersey, Paul Jr was the son of Paul Volcker, a civil engineer, and his wife, Alma (nee Klippel); his grandparents were all German immigrants. He grew up in the conventional world of 1930s and 40s America – going to high school, attending the local Lutheran church, but already showing an interest in public affairs and a precocious intelligence . He gained a degree in history, economics and political science at Princeton University (1949), and went on to do a master’s in political economy and government at Harvard, and to study at the London school of Economics. In 1952 he joined the New York Federal Reserve as an economist. A career alternating between Wall Street and the US Treasury in ever more responsible jobs then followed before fatefully he caught the eye of President Carter in 1979. He was a convinced believer in international collaboration, helping to fashion the Plaza accords in 1986 when Germany and Japan agreed to allow their currencies to appreciate, so limiting their trade imbalances with the US. This vital adjustment, he knew, would not come from market forces spontaneously but from intergovernmental collaboration. He was a founder of the Trilateral Commission, to foster relations between Japan, western Europe and north America, and regular attender at the Bilderberg meetings of leaders and experts from Europe and north America, believing that the key international players had to understand each other better. Towards the end of his life this believer in the power, capacity and importance of good government became increasingly concerned about the collapse of trust in government, founding the Volcker Alliance to advance the understanding of – and education for – careers in public service. In 1954 he married Barbara Bahnson; she died in 1998. In 2010 he married Anke Dening, and she survives him, along with James and Janice, the children of his first marriage. • Paul Adolph Volcker, central banker and economist, born 5 September 1927; died 8 December 2019","Paul Volcker changed the US financial system. He also affected how banks work in Britain.

Paul Volcker was born in Cape May, New Jersey. His father was Paul Volcker, a builder. His mother was Alma. His grandparents came from Germany.

He grew up in America in the 1930s and 1940s. He went to high school and church. He was interested in what was happening in the world. He was very smart.

He studied history, economics, and politics at Princeton University. He got a degree in 1949. Then, he studied more at Harvard and in London.

In 1952, he started working as an economist at the New York Federal Reserve.

He worked on Wall Street and for the US government. He had more and more important jobs. In 1979, President Carter noticed him.

He believed countries should work together. In 1986, he helped create the Plaza Accords. Germany and Japan agreed to make their money worth more. This helped with trade problems with the US. He knew this needed countries to work together. It would not happen by itself.

He started the Trilateral Commission. This group helped Japan, Europe, and North America work together. He also went to Bilderberg meetings. These meetings were for leaders and experts from Europe and North America. He thought important people from different countries needed to understand each other.

Later in his life, he worried that people did not trust the government. He started the Volcker Alliance. This group helped people learn about working for the government.

61,61_0,0,"High street sales slumped in November in the weakest period for consumer spending for more than a year, as shoppers reined in their spending in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales across Britain fell by 0.6% when compared with the previous month, with only household goods stores reporting growth. In a sign of the stress facing retailers, the quantity of goods bought dropped by 0.4% in the three months to November compared with the previous three months, the first decline since April 2018. Annual growth in sales also slowed to 1%, mainly because of a slump in spending in non-food stores. The latest figures from the high street and online suggest heavy discounting around Black Friday failed to tempt consumers to part with their cash in one of the worst periods for retailers in recent decades. Analysts said unsettled weather, political and economic uncertainty over Brexit and the snap election, and consumers leaving their shopping to the last minute in hope of bigger discounts, all had an impact last month. High street retailers are also struggling with rising wage bills and the cost of business rates, as well as tough competition as consumers switch to online shopping. Recognising the difficulties on the high street, the government said it was committed to a “fundamental review” of business rates and announced new measures to help independent retailers in the Queen’s speech on Thursday. The measures include a 50% discount on business rates for small to medium-sized high street properties including shops, pubs and restaurants with a rateable value of less than £51,000, up from a 33% discount at present. The discount is also being extended to cinemas and music venues. The plans are unlikely to do much to help troubled major retailers such as House of Fraser or Debenhams as retail chains are not eligible for the discount and neither are large department stores. November was the fourth month in a row without growth in retail spending – the longest stretch since the mid-90s. The ONS said Black Friday was not included in the figures, as the US-inspired day of shopping discounts fell late in the month, on 29 November. It said its seasonally adjusted estimates accounted for this shift in timing. However, analysts said the timing of Black Friday could have had an impact and probably distorted November’s spending figures. The ONS said Black Friday spending patterns would probably influence its December release, with only early promotions captured in the November estimates.","Shops on the high street sold less in November. This was the worst time for shopping in over a year. People did not spend much money before Christmas.

The Office for National Statistics said that shop sales in Britain went down by 0.6%. This is when compared to the month before. Only shops selling things for the house sold more.

Shops are having problems. People bought 0.4% fewer things in the three months before November. This is compared to the three months before that. This is the first time sales have gone down since April 2018.

The sales went up only 1% compared to last year. This is because people did not buy many things from non-food shops.

Shops in the high street and online had big sales for Black Friday. But people did not want to spend their money. It was a very bad time for shops.

Experts said that the weather was bad. Also, people were not sure about Brexit and the election. People waited to buy things, hoping for better sales. All these things made a difference last month.

Shops on the high street also have to pay more money to workers. The cost of business rates is also high. It is hard for them because more people are shopping online.

The government knows that shops on the high street are having problems. They said they will look at the business rates again. They also said they will help small shops. This was in the Queen's speech.

Small shops, pubs, and restaurants will pay 50% less in business rates. This is for shops that are not too big. Now, they pay 33% less. Cinemas and music places will also pay less.

But this will not help big shops like House of Fraser or Debenhams. Big shops cannot get this discount.

November was the fourth month in a row that shop sales did not go up. This is the longest time since the 90s.

The Office for National Statistics said that Black Friday is not in the numbers. Black Friday was at the end of November, on the 29th. They said that the numbers take this into account.

But experts said that Black Friday might have made a difference. It probably changed the numbers for November.

The Office for National Statistics said that Black Friday will probably change the numbers for December. Only the sales before Black Friday are in the November numbers."
61,61_1,1,"Duncan Brewer, a retail partner at the consultancy Oliver Wyman, said political uncertainty had lifted since the election and unemployment remained low, in a positive signal for consumer spending. However, he warned that at least two high street shopping chains were likely to go bust next year and about 100,000 jobs were likely to be cut across the sector. He said: “The slump in retail sales over November goes to show that despite the momentous shopping holiday of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, discounting periods are not an effective way of getting people into the shops.”","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

Duncan Brewer works for a company called Oliver Wyman. He helps shops. He said things are better now because the election is finished. Also, not many people are out of work. This is good for shops because people can spend money.

But Duncan said something bad might happen. He thinks that two big shops will close next year. This means that about 100,000 people who work in shops might lose their jobs.

Duncan also talked about sales. He said that shops had bad sales in November. This is even though there was Black Friday and Cyber Monday. These are days when shops sell things for less money. Duncan thinks that selling things for less does not help shops get more customers."
62,62_0,0,"No one has dug into the vaults of the Bank of England and pilfered a gold bar, but security breaches for a central bank in the 21st-century age of information do not come much worse than this. Hedge funds have managed to gain access to an audio feed of the governor’s press conferences, thereby securing for themselves an advantage of a few seconds over viewers of the slightly delayed TV broadcast. In modern frantic markets, seconds can matter. The misuse of the audio feed by an unnamed third-party supplier is “wholly unacceptable”, said the Bank after the report by the Times. The governor, Mark Carney, will be squirming with embarrassment. He arrived in 2013 on a mission to modernise the Bank’s operations and information security was top of the list. Now Threadneedle Street stands accused of gross naivety. The audio feed was designed as a back-up in case the TV system failed, but the potential for mischief should have been obvious. The Bank left a back door, if not wide open, then significantly ajar. The call for somebody’s resignation will be loud. No hedge fund or trader, it should be said, had advance knowledge of the Bank’s actual policy decisions, which are the main event on these stage-managed occasions. Interest rate decisions, for example, are announced to the world on the stroke of midday, and the full set of accompanying documents is published simultaneously. Journalists are allowed to read the contents in advance only if they are locked in the bowels of the Bank until midday in a secure room with no wifi or mobile phone signal. The security breach concerns only the press conferences, which start at 12.30pm. A consolation for the Bank, one could argue, is that Carney’s press conferences tend to be spectacularly dull. He’s in the business of explaining reports that are in the public domain by the time he speaks and he tends not to stray far from his mental script. For ordinary mortals, a five-second informational advantage might be useless. Even five minutes to wade through Carney’s sub-clauses might not yield nuggets to indicate if the pound should be moving up, down or sideways.","It is very hard to steal gold from the Bank of England. But something bad happened with the Bank's security. This happened in the 21st century, when information is very important.

Some hedge funds got secret access. They could listen to the audio of the governor's speeches before everyone else. The governor is the head of the Bank. The hedge funds could hear the audio a few seconds before people watching TV.

In today's markets, even a few seconds can be important. This gave the hedge funds an advantage. The Bank of England said that this was ""not acceptable."" This happened because of a third-party company. This company should not have done this.

The governor, Mark Carney, will be upset. He started working at the Bank in 2013. He wanted to make the Bank modern. He also wanted to improve security. Now, people think the Bank was careless.

The audio was meant to be a backup. It was for if the TV system did not work. But it was easy for people to misuse it. The Bank did not protect the audio well enough. People will want someone to lose their job because of this.

The hedge funds did not know the Bank's plans before they were announced. The important decisions are still secret until they are made public. For example, interest rates are announced at 12:00. All the documents are released at the same time.

Journalists can read the documents early. But they must stay in a secure room at the Bank until 12:00. They cannot use Wi-Fi or their phones. The security problem was only with the press conferences, which start at 12:30.

The Bank can feel a little better because the governor's speeches are often boring. He talks about reports that people can already read. He usually says what he has planned.

For most people, a few seconds of information is not helpful. Even a few minutes to read the governor's words might not help them know if the British pound will go up or down."
62,62_1,1,"The trouble is, there is a breed of hedge funds that does not operate like ordinary mortals do. They’re pursuing fast action and even the possibility of morsels of information count in their world. Some even run artificial intelligence computer programmes to alight on specific words or phrases and then trade instantly, and perhaps only for a brief second, on what they learn. This type of hedge fund may also be interested in what Carney doesn’t say, as much as what he does, in response to a question. Such strategies seek only marginal gains, and success is clearly not guaranteed, but a central bank simply cannot give anybody any theoretical opportunity to get ahead of the market. The fallout from this affair will be fascinating. The Financial Conduct Authority will have to decide if the third-party supplier (which surely won’t remain unidentified for long) has merely breached its contract with the Bank or has committed market abuse, which is a serious regulatory matter. The market abuse question also applies to the hedge funds, though the FCA will face an obvious difficulty in proving that a trade was placed because of access to the audio feed rather than something unrelated. This could be groundbreaking territory. The judgment on the Bank of England, by contrast, is already clear. It looks amateurish.","Some hedge funds are different. They do not work like normal people. They want to act very fast. Even small pieces of information are important to them.

Some use computers with special programs. These programs look for certain words or phrases. Then, the computers trade very quickly, maybe for only one second. They trade based on what they find.

These hedge funds might also watch what someone *does not* say. For example, they might watch what Mr. Carney doesn't say when someone asks him a question. They want to gain a small advantage.

Winning is not certain for them. But a big bank like the central bank can't let anyone get ahead in the market. That is not allowed.

This situation will be interesting. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will have to decide what happened. Did the company that gave the information break the rules of their contract with the bank? Or did they do something illegal called ""market abuse?"" This is a serious problem.

The FCA will also look at the hedge funds. Did they trade because they heard the audio early? Or did they trade for another reason? It will be hard for the FCA to prove why they traded. This could be a new situation for the FCA.

However, we already know what we think about the Bank of England. They made a mistake. It looks like they were not professional."
63,63_0,0,"Saturday was not so super for retailers last weekend, as numbers visiting high streets and shopping centres fell by nearly 8% compared with the previous year. With some retailers accepting online orders as late as Christmas Eve, shoppers now have many more choices about the way they shop and often hang on for last-minute bargains. More than a third (36%) of Brits have left gift-buying until the last few days before Christmas, according to Argos. It said 10% more men than women leave gift-buying until very late, with the most popular gift bought in its stores on Christmas Eve last year being an electric toothbrush. John Lewis expected novelty socks and gadgets such as airpods and smart speakers to be its most popular last-minute items. Monday was expected to be the busiest day for food retailers with Waitrose expecting to sell 214,000kg of sprouts in the final days before Christmas and 250% more quails eggs than usual. The lower turnout recorded by shopper monitoring firm Springboard on Saturday –traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year – came despite a flurry of discounts from retailers in an effort to tempt bargain hunters after a difficult trading year. Industry experts said the plethora of promotions on offer since November, and particularly over the Black Friday discount period at the end of November, meant many had spent their money early or were underwhelmed by further price cuts. Late last week Topshop and Miss Selfridge increased their discounts to up to 60%, from 40% and 50% respectively earlier in the week, while Jigsaw, Peacocks and House of Fraser increased their price cuts to 50%, matching Debenhams, Hobbs and Oasis, which had deepened their discounts. Marks &amp; Spencer also added knitwear to its price-cutting pile, offering 40% off its key seasonal category, as well as a half-price on beauty gifts offer. The difficult trading is expected to bring further distress for retailers in early 2020 after numerous administrations and store closures this year. The number of retailers in financial distress in the final quarter of the year has risen 1.4% on the same period last year to 27,000, according to data from the corporate recovery firm Begbies Traynor. Fashion chains are among the worst affected, with the number in distress increasing by 21% in the past three years to 3,355.","Last Saturday was not a great day for shops. Fewer people went to the shops than last year. About 8% fewer people visited the streets and shopping centers.

Shops are now taking orders online until Christmas Eve. So, people have more ways to shop. They often wait for prices to go down at the last minute.

Argos said that 36% of people in Britain buy gifts just before Christmas. This is more than one third of all people. Men are more likely to buy gifts late than women. Last year, the most popular gift at Argos on Christmas Eve was an electric toothbrush.

John Lewis thought that fun socks and gadgets would be popular last-minute gifts. Gadgets like airpods and smart speakers.

Monday was expected to be busy for food shops. Waitrose thought they would sell a lot of sprouts. They thought they would sell 214,000 kg of sprouts. They also thought they would sell much more quails eggs than usual. 250% more!

A company called Springboard checks how many people go to shops. They said that fewer people went shopping on Saturday. This was despite shops having sales. Shops wanted to get more people to buy things after a bad year.

Experts said that there were many sales in November. This was especially during Black Friday. Because of this, people spent their money early. Or, they were not interested in more sales.

Topshop and Miss Selfridge had bigger sales at the end of the week. The prices were up to 60% off. Before, the prices were 40% or 50% off. Other shops like Jigsaw and Peacocks also had sales with 50% off. Debenhams and Hobbs did the same.

Marks & Spencer also had sales on clothes. They had 40% off some clothes. They also had half-price on beauty gifts.

The bad year for shops may cause problems in 2020. Some shops may close. Many shops are having money problems.

A company called Begbies Traynor said that more shops are in trouble. About 27,000 shops are having problems. This is 1.4% more than last year.

Fashion shops are having the most problems. The number of fashion shops with problems has gone up by 21% in three years. Now, 3,355 fashion shops are in trouble."

64,64_0,0,"The Bank of England restructured its security department and lost multiple senior employees in charge of protecting some of Britain’s most critical financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal. After the central bank admitted that hedge funds had gained early access to its market-moving press conferences via a backup audio feed, multiple former employees contacted the Observer to warn that the Bank was struggling with the departure of key staff responsible for protecting it against external threats. The sources said at least 20 of the Bank’s staff tasked with information security had left or been reassigned elsewhere within the bank within the past year, raising questions over the protection of the nation’s payment systems and other critical infrastructure vital for the British financial system. The Observer was able to verify 13 of these departures using information from social media and other sources. The revelations come at a sensitive time for the Bank as it prepares for the handover of power in March from Mark Carney, the outgoing governor, to Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Threadneedle Street has also played a central role in efforts to improve the safety and integrity of the financial system since the 2008 banking collapse, including warning the industry to improve its cyber and information security operations. It is responsible for key parts of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including the payments systems that carry every bank transfer made in Britain, the wages of millions of people, cheques, and payments between businesses of all sizes. On an average day in 2018, the Bank’s real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) settled transactions worth £651bn. According to the former employees, the Bank’s chief information security officer and two deputies have left in the past year. Multiple former employees described the organisation as beset by budget cuts before Carney’s departure, against a backdrop of concerns over cost efficiency. They said there were problems with staffing given the departures and low staff morale. Much of the disquiet stemmed from a move to dismantle the Bank’s “security and privacy” directorate, the people said. The team, part of the central services division, previously had oversight over cyber, personnel and physical security matters, as well as privacy. Staff and responsibilities were instead spread across other parts of the organisation.","The Bank of England changed its security team. Some important people who protected the Bank left their jobs. This happened before a big problem at the Bank. The Observer newspaper found out about this.

The Bank said that some companies got important news early. These companies were called hedge funds. They heard the news from a secret audio system.

After this, some former workers told the Observer about problems at the Bank. They said the Bank was having trouble because important people left. These people were in charge of keeping the Bank safe.

The former workers said that at least 20 people who worked on security left or moved to other jobs in the Bank. This happened in the last year. People are worried about how safe Britain's money systems are.

The Observer checked and found that 13 people had left. They used information from the internet to do this.

This news is coming at a bad time. The leader of the Bank, Mark Carney, is leaving in March. Andrew Bailey will be the new leader.

The Bank of England is important for keeping the money system safe. It has been trying to make the financial system safer since 2008. It told other banks to make their computer systems safer.

The Bank is in charge of important things, like the system that moves money between banks. This system pays people's wages and helps businesses pay each other.

In 2018, this system moved about £651 billion every day.

The former workers said that the person in charge of computer security and two helpers left in the last year.

The former workers also said the Bank had less money to spend before Mark Carney left. They said it was hard to find enough workers because people were leaving and did not feel happy at work.

Many problems started when the Bank got rid of a special team. This team was called ""security and privacy."" They looked after computer security, people's safety, and keeping things private. Now, these jobs are done by different people in the Bank."
64,64_1,1,"It is understood that many of the people now sit under the Bank’s technology, security and risk directorates, in a move designed to make the organisation safer. The Bank has about 70 cybersecurity professionals. A Bank of England spokeswoman said: “The Bank operates the highest standard of information security and is confident in our ability to recognise cyber threats and defend our systems appropriately. Earlier this year, the Bank completed a review of its central services target operating model and, as part of that, reinforced the arrangements for first- and second-line information security. This change was fully supported by the Bank’s audit and risk committee.” The Bank admitted late on Wednesday night that it had suffered a security breach, with a provider of a backup audio feed of the governor’s market-sensitive press conferences selling early access to unnamed investors without its knowledge. Those investors could have used the few seconds’ advantage to profit. It was alerted to the breach by the Times newspaper, conducted a rapid internal investigation and passed the matter to the FCA. The City watchdog has confirmed it is investigating the issue, and it is understood that Bailey will recuse himself from all discussions of the matter to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest. The Bank’s chief operating officer, Joanna Place, is the most senior manager responsible for physical and information security, and faced calls to resign from a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, Danny Blanchflower, following the breach. Place, who was appointed in July 2017, reports directly to the governor, and has an equal status to the Bank’s deputy governors. Multiple sources said the Bank was under pressure to cut the budget of the central services division, which was managed by Place. They said the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned in December 2018 that the Bank needed to deliver better value for money. Place told the Commons’ public accounts committee in January that the Bank did not “have any gaps in cybersecurity”. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, resigned little over a month later. Multiple other security experts followed him. A spokeswoman for the Bank said Rogers resigned on 23 February and that Place was not aware he was going to quit when she gave evidence on 21 January.","Many people now work for the Bank in the technology, security, and risk areas. This is to make the Bank safer. The Bank has about 70 people who work on computer security.

A person from the Bank of England said that the Bank has very good information security. She said they can find computer problems and protect their systems.

Earlier this year, the Bank looked at how it works. They made the information security better. The Bank's audit and risk group agreed with this change.

The Bank said that there was a security problem. A company that gave a backup audio of the governor's talks sold early access to some people. The Bank did not know about this. These people could use this early access to make money.

The Times newspaper told the Bank about the problem. The Bank quickly checked what happened. Then they told the FCA about it. The FCA is checking the problem.

Someone said that Andrew Bailey will not be part of any talks about this. This is to make sure there is no problem with what he does.

Joanna Place is in charge of security at the Bank. Someone who used to work at the Bank, Danny Blanchflower, said she should quit her job after the security problem. Joanna Place started her job in 2017. She tells the governor what is happening. She is as important as the deputy governors.

Some people said that the Bank needed to spend less money on central services. Joanna Place was in charge of this. The National Audit Office said in 2018 that the Bank needed to be careful with money.

Joanna Place told a group of people that the Bank was safe from computer problems. But her chief information security officer, Cameron ""Buck"" Rogers, quit his job a little later. Other security experts also quit.

A person from the Bank said that Rogers quit on February 23. She said that Joanna Place did not know he was going to quit when she talked to the group of people on January 21."
64,64_2,2,"At the hearing, Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, expressed surprise at Place’s answer, given the difficulties other public-sector organisations had with recruiting and retaining cyber security staff, and asked again if there were any vacancies. Place responded: “Offhand, I do not know whether we have any vacancies, but we do not have a problem with recruiting and we do not have a problem with retention in cyber, either.” There was widespread unease within the Bank following her testimony, multiple sources said, and in the months after her appearance the cybersecurity function suffered the outflow of staff. The public sector struggles to retain staff in cybersecurity roles because of intense competition from the higher-paying private sector. However, the reputation of the Bank and its important role in protecting financial stability are attractive for potential candidates, and the sources said they believed it was in the public interest to shed light on the problems it was facing. A Bank of England spokesperson said: “The incident relating to the misuse of a backup audio feed from the Bank’s press conferences by a third-party supplier, which the Bank has referred to the Financial Conduct Authority for further investigation, was not a cyber security issue.”","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

Meg Hillier was at a meeting. She is the leader of a group called Labour committee. She was surprised by what someone named Place said.

Other groups that work for the government have problems. They can't find or keep people who work in cyber security. Meg asked Place again if they had any jobs open.

Place said she did not know if there were jobs open. But she said they did not have trouble finding people for cyber security. And she said people did not leave their cyber security jobs.

Many people at the Bank were worried after what Place said. Some people said that many cyber security workers left the Bank after she spoke.

It is hard for the government to keep cyber security workers. Companies that are not part of the government pay more money.

But the Bank is famous. It helps to keep money safe. So, some people want to work there. The people who spoke up thought it was important to talk about the Bank's problems.

Someone from the Bank of England said something else. They said that a company used a secret recording from the Bank's news events. The Bank told the Financial Conduct Authority to look into this. The Bank said this problem was not about cyber security."
65,65_0,0,"UK high streets have shed more than 140,000 jobs this year as store closures and retail failures made 2019 one of the most challenging years in a generation. More than 2,750 jobs were lost every week, according to a detailed analysis by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) published today. It predicts the picture will worsen in 2020, unless the government intervenes, with high business rates one of the factors blamed for accelerating chain store closures. Prof Joshua Bamfield, the CRR’s director, said retail was in crisis owing to high costs, low levels of profitability and sales moving online. “These problems are felt by most businesses operating from physical stores in high streets or shopping malls,” Bamfield said. “The low growth in consumer spending since 2015 has meant that the growth in online sales has come at the expense of the high street.” The CRR said 38,100 of the jobs lost this year were down to retail chains going bust with Karen Millen and Coast among 2019’s high profile casualties. Another 26,500 roles were shed through company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a controversial insolvency procedure that has been used by the likes of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group and Debenhams to shed loss-making stores. Another 78,600 jobs were axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small shops simply shutting for good. Marks &amp; Spencer is among the big names closing stores while House of Fraser, which is part of Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, has also been shutting outlets. A total of 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019, according to CRR’s calculations, up by more than a fifth on 2018’s 117,400. The CRR also calculated that 16,073 shops closed around the UK in 2019, or around 61 every working day. That was an increase on the 14,583 shops which closed in 2018. A separate study looking at how the UK labour market had changed over the past decade said the rise of online shopping had eliminated 289,000 “traditional” high street roles. Eight out of 10 of these entry-level retail jobs – positions like sales assistant and checkout operator – were held by women, according to the RSA Future Work Centre.","Shops in the UK are losing many jobs.

They said that more than 2,750 jobs were lost each week.
They think things will get worse in 2020.

65,65_1,1,"The thinktank is part of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the charity run by Matthew Taylor who authored a gig economy review for Theresa May when she was prime minister. Alan Lockey, who heads the thinktank, said: “The carnage on the high street has hollowed out many jobs traditionally held by women, but areas of growth related to e-commerce, such as van driving, are going more to men. This is having a profound effect on individuals, families and society.” Today one in every five pounds spent at the shops is online – more than double the level at the start of the decade. The resulting shift in labour markets are stark. There are now 166,000 fewer check-out staff, shelf fillers and sales assistants than at the start of the 2010s, according to RSA’s analysis of official employment data, while the pool of bank and post office clerks has shrunk by 65,000 as branches closed. By comparison there are 102,000 more van drivers and 161,000 more administration roles. Lockey said the decline of the high street was the most dramatic factor affecting the UK’s jobs landscape, even though austerity, which had eliminated 109,000 public sector administrators, also loomed large. Despite the reckoning taking place the retail sector remains the UK’s biggest private sector employer with a workforce of around 3 million. Its decline contrasts with a wider picture showing record levels of employment as former shop workers find alternative work in restaurants, hotels and as care workers. The RSA study showed a near 78,000 rise in the number of care workers. “The employment figures show that over the last decade the economy has been good at creating jobs but low skilled workers in the retail sector have been pushed from pillar to post. The alternative jobs they are getting are often low paid and do not provide good security, leading to working poverty,” Lockey added. The important Christmas trading period appears to have brought little respite for struggling retail chains. Trading during November and December was marred by heavy discounting as stores sought to tempt out shoppers put off by the uncertainty around Brexit and the 12 December general election. The post-Christmas sales got off to a disappointing start too, attracting smaller crowds than in previous years.","This group studies important things. It is part of a bigger group called the Royal Society. This group helps with arts, factories, and business. Matthew Taylor runs this group. He wrote a report about the gig economy for Theresa May when she was the leader of the country.

Alan Lockey is the boss of the study group. He said that many shops are closing. This means that women are losing jobs. But new jobs are being created because of online shopping. For example, there are more van drivers. But men are getting these jobs more often than women. This is bad for people, families, and the country.

Now, people spend more money online. They spend twice as much as they did ten years ago. This has changed the job market a lot.

There are fewer people working as check-out staff, shelf fillers, and sales assistants. There are 166,000 fewer of these jobs than ten years ago. Also, 65,000 fewer people work in banks and post offices because many branches have closed.

But there are more van drivers. There are 102,000 more van drivers now. Also, there are 161,000 more jobs in administration.

Alan Lockey said that shops closing is the biggest problem for jobs in the UK. The government also cut money, which caused 109,000 public sector jobs to be lost.

Even though many shops are closing, the retail business is still the biggest employer in the UK. About 3 million people work in retail.

Even though retail is doing badly, there are many jobs in the UK. People who used to work in shops are finding jobs in other places. They are working in restaurants, hotels, and as care workers. The study showed that there are almost 78,000 more care workers.

Alan Lockey said that the economy has made many jobs in the last ten years. But people with less skills who worked in shops are having trouble. The new jobs they are getting often do not pay well and are not secure. This means that they are working but still poor.

Shops hoped to make a lot of money during Christmas. But it was not a good time for them. They had to give big discounts to get people to shop. People were worried about Brexit and the election. The sales after Christmas were not very good either. Not many people came to the shops."
66,66_0,0,"The embattled US aircraft maker Boeing has reportedly sent US regulators “troubling communications” related to the development of the 737 MAX – on the same day that the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was forced to step aside. According to a senior Boeing executive, the documents include new messages from Mark Forkner, a senior company test pilot who complained of “egregious” erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of Boeing’s MCAS anti-stall system, and referred to “Jedi mind tricks” to persuade regulators to approve the plane. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Seattle Times that the Forkner communications contain the same kind of “trash talking” about Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulators as the earlier messages released in October. The release is likely to deepen the sense of crisis enveloping Boeing, which has taken more than $8bn in costs and lost more than 20% of its market value since the 737 variant was grounded in March following two crashes. Last week, the company said it would temporarily halt production of the troubled jet. Forkner, meanwhile, has reportedly hired his own criminal defense lawyers and invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid turning over records to the US Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal inquiry into the company’s handling of the 737 Max’s development. It was Forkner who requested that information about MCAS be omitted from flight manuals and pilot training, rendering the pilots of both the doomed Lion Air and Ethiopian flights helpless when the system kicked in, pushing the plane’s nose down repeatedly until they ultimately lost control. But the timing of the latest information release is likely to increase anger surrounding Boeing’s handling of the crisis, even as a new CEO, David Calhoun, takes the reins early next year. In a statement released on Monday, Boeing said that under the “new leadership”, Boeing “will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA, other global regulators and its customers”. But the latest drop of documents could complicate those intentions, and further challenge its relationship with regulators.","Boeing is an airplane company in the US. They are having problems with their 737 MAX plane.

Boeing sent some papers to US people who check planes. These papers are not good.

At the same time, the boss of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, had to leave his job.

A person who works at Boeing said the papers have messages from Mark Forkner. He is a pilot who tests planes.

Mark Forkner said the 737 MAX plane was not working well in tests. He talked about a system that stops the plane from falling down. This system is called MCAS.

Mark Forkner said he used ""tricks"" to make the people who check planes say the plane was okay.

The person who works at Boeing did not want to say their name. They said Mark Forkner made fun of the people who check planes. He did the same thing in messages before.

These new papers make the problems at Boeing worse. The company has lost a lot of money because of the 737 MAX. The plane stopped flying in March after two planes crashed.

Boeing said they will stop making the 737 MAX for a while.

Mark Forkner has hired lawyers. He does not want to give papers to the US government. The government is checking if Boeing did something wrong with the 737 MAX.

Mark Forkner asked for information about the MCAS system to not be in the books for pilots. This made it hard for the pilots when the system started working on the planes that crashed. The system pushed the plane down, and the pilots could not stop it.

The new papers make people even more angry at Boeing. A new boss, David Calhoun, will start next year.

Boeing said they will be open and honest with everyone. They will talk to the people who check planes and other important people.

But these new papers could make things harder for Boeing. It might make it harder for them to work with the people who check planes."
66,66_1,1,"The aerospace giant already angered the FAA by failing to turn over the Forkner messages for eight months because of the criminal investigation into how the plane was originally approved for service. “The FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery,” the regulator said in a statement on 18 October. The regulator was also reportedly further vexed by Muilenburg’s predictions that the 737 Max would imminently be cleared to return to service, which it regarded as placing pressure on the agency to approve Boeing’s MCAS software fix even as it was taking a hit to its reputation for being too cozy with the plane maker. Last month, Muilenburg was reportedly called to a meeting in Washington with the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, and dressed down for applying perceived pressure on the regulator. An internal FAA memo written by Dickson and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, said the FAA would not work to any schedule. Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020. Muilenburg’s efforts to take responsibility for the 737 debacle, and to apologize for its tragic consequences, fell flat with lawmakers, the public and grieving families, costing him his job. During congressional testimony, Muilenburg offered muddled responses to lawmaker’s demands for clarity on the development and approval of the 737 Max, and why it had not been immediately grounded after the first crash in Indonesia. “You’re not trying to Jedi mind-trick us here today on this committee?” the Democrat Dina Titus challenged. Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to receive $26.5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package. His payout could reach as high as $58.5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 annually and Boeing stock worth another $13.3m. In a statement on Monday, Boeing’s board said it had decided that “a change in leadership” was necessary to restore confidence. But it chose not to fire the executive, allowing him to keep his pay package and saving Boeing from the impression its most senior executive had done something wrong.","A big airplane company made the FAA angry. The FAA is in charge of airplane safety. The company did not give the FAA some messages for a long time. It took eight months. The messages were about how the airplane was first approved. There was a criminal investigation about this.

The FAA said they were not happy. Boeing did not tell them about the messages right away. They found the messages, but did not tell the FAA.

The FAA was also upset about something else. The company's boss, Muilenburg, said the 737 Max airplane would fly again soon. The FAA thought he was trying to make them hurry. They did not want to approve the airplane too fast. They wanted to check the new software. Some people thought the FAA was too friendly with the airplane company. This made the FAA look bad.

Last month, Muilenburg met with the FAA boss. The FAA boss, Steve Dickson, was not happy with Muilenburg. He thought Muilenburg was trying to make the FAA hurry.

An FAA paper said the FAA would not hurry. The FAA said the 737 Max would not fly again until 2020.

Muilenburg said he was sorry about the 737 problems. Many people died in crashes. But people did not believe him. They did not like what he said. This made him lose his job.

He talked to people in Congress. They asked him about the 737 Max. They wanted to know why it was not stopped from flying after the first crash. They thought he was not giving clear answers. One person asked if he was trying to trick them.

Muilenburg is 55 years old. He will get money and stocks when he leaves the company. It could be about $26.5 million. It could even be $58.5 million. He will also get money every year from his pension.

Boeing said they needed a new leader. They wanted people to trust them again. But they did not fire Muilenburg. He can keep his money. This makes it look like he did not do anything wrong."
66,66_2,2,"But according to subsequent reports, it was not just the handling of 737 Max crisis or squabbles with the FAA that ultimately doomed Muilenburg. Last week, a high-profile launch of Boeing’s space capsule went awry.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at CEFR B1 level:

Boeing had problems. The way they dealt with the 737 Max plane was not good. They also argued with the FAA. The FAA is the group that makes rules for planes.

Later, we heard more reasons why the boss of Boeing lost his job. Last week, Boeing tried to send a capsule into space. It was a very important event. But the launch did not go as planned. It went wrong."
67,67_0,0,"The Chinese proverb is “be careful what you wish for”. My own adapted version is “be careful what you vote for”. I make no apology for having devoted so many columns to what on Thursday became the lost cause of Remain. The pro-European cause in this country has, alas, suffered from a colossal failure of leadership. The failure to make the case for our EU membership goes back a long way, as does the drip-drip of the vile anti-European campaign in the Murdoch press, and the obvious suspects in other sections of the media. The sequence of events was well brought out in Denis MacShane’s prophetic book Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe in 2015. (What lies in store is outlined both in MacShane’s latest volume, Brexiternity, and Sir Ivan Rogers’s recent magisterial lecture at Glasgow University.) As MacShane wrote in 2015: “The referendum on Europe is not on the benefits or cost of EU membership, but a wider protest about economic and social change which appears inside Britain to produce as many losers as winners.” It was always easy to blame “Brussels” for policies that became controversial, even when those policies were initiated by successive UK governments themselves. One of the leading perpetrators of lies about Europe was, of course, the Telegraph’s former Brussels correspondent himself: Boris Johnson. Johnson is such a master of what his putative hero Winston Churchill called “terminological inexactitudes” that nothing he claimed during the campaign or the morning of his victory can be taken at face value. “One-nation Conservatism”? Governing for the interests of those northerners who have “lent him their votes”? Pull the other one! How does that compare with his plans for deregulation, closer alignment with Trump’s America, and the opportunities for profiting from Brexit to which his financial backers look forward? As Rogers said in his Glasgow lecture, Johnson’s claim that we will “not suffer any downside in terms of market access into easily our biggest market for goods and services … is clearly untrue. It does not get any truer through endless repetition.” The nation has been the victim of a gigantic con trick on the part of the Leave campaign.","It's like an old saying: ""Think carefully about what you want."" I also think we should be careful about who we vote for.

I have written a lot about why I wanted Britain to stay in the European Union. I am sorry that this did not happen.

The people who wanted Britain to stay in the EU did not do a good job. They did not explain why it was good for the country.

For a long time, some newspapers and other media have said bad things about the EU. They slowly made people think that the EU was bad.

Denis MacShane wrote a book in 2015 called ""Brexit."" It said how Britain would leave Europe. He also wrote another book called ""Brexiternity."" And Ivan Rogers gave a speech about it. These books and speeches tell us what might happen now.

MacShane wrote that the vote about Europe was not just about money. It was about people being unhappy with changes in the country. Some people felt like they were losing out.

It was easy to blame the EU for problems. But sometimes, the British government made those problems.

Boris Johnson used to work for a newspaper in Brussels. He often said things that were not true about Europe. He is very good at saying things that sound good, but are not really correct.

We cannot believe everything Johnson said during the campaign or after he won.

He says he wants to help everyone in the country. He says he wants to help people in the north who voted for him. But he also wants to make changes that will help rich people and make closer ties with America. His rich friends are happy about Brexit because they can make money from it.

Rogers said that Johnson is wrong when he says that Britain will not have any problems selling things to Europe after Brexit. Just saying it over and over does not make it true.

The people who wanted Britain to leave the EU tricked the country. They told people things that were not true."
67,67_1,1,"The nonsensical propaganda about “getting Brexit done” was finally too much for the counsellor in the British embassy in Washington who resigned recently because she could no longer face peddling a misleading line. But back to failures of leadership: Jeremy Corbyn’s failure was on an epic scale. Reputedly a Leaver himself, he made a huge mistake in thinking that, by equivocating over the referendum, he could somehow please those supposedly natural Labour voters in the Midlands and the north who had voted Leave in the referendum. The election showed that too many of them merely laughed in his face. It seems that the election was also a referendum on Corbyn. There has been, and will continue to be, endless speculation about the reasons why the electorate distrusted him even more than Johnson. But historically there seems to me a simple, fundamental cause, whatever the deficiencies in Corbyn personally. In the early 1980s the sensible centre of the Labour party fought the extreme left – then known as the Militant Tendency, not Momentum – and saw them off. The late Denis Healey played a crucial role, as did Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley. And the moderate left in Britain and continental Europe watched the failure of President Mitterrand’s experiment with “socialism in one country” between 1981 and 1983 and learned the lesson. Among those who learned the lesson was Mitterrand himself. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also took note. Alas, this time the extreme left captured the Labour party, with the results we now see. For reasons that I fail to understand, Corbyn and his allies, such as Seumas Milne, believe that the EU is some kind of capitalist conspiracy. Despite the many doubts about Corbyn himself, if he had not equivocated and campaigned vigorously in favour of Remain and a referendum with no ifs or buts, there might well have been a hung parliament and deals which could have contained Corbyn’s wilder plans. Also, the hapless Jo Swinson should not have made the strategic mistake of ruling out the second referendum her party had previously espoused. However, we are where we are.","A woman worked at the British embassy in America. She had to tell people about Brexit. Brexit was a plan for Britain to leave the European Union.

The woman thought the things she had to say about Brexit were not true. She did not want to say things that were not true. So, she quit her job.

Someone named Jeremy Corbyn was a leader in Britain. He made big mistakes. Some people said he wanted Britain to leave the European Union.

There was a vote about leaving the European Union. Corbyn did not say clearly what he thought. He thought this would make people happy. He wanted people in some parts of Britain to like him. These people had voted to leave the European Union.

But these people did not like Corbyn. They did not trust him. The election was also about Corbyn. People did not trust him more than another leader named Johnson.

Why did people not trust Corbyn? This happened before. In the 1980s, some people in the Labour party were too extreme. Other people in the Labour party fought against them. They won.

Some leaders in Britain learned a lesson. The leader of France, Mitterrand, tried something called ""socialism."" It did not work well. People learned that extreme ideas do not work.

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were also leaders in Britain. They remembered this lesson. But this time, the extreme people took over the Labour party. We can see the bad results now.

Corbyn and his friends thought the European Union was bad. They thought it was a plan by rich people. I do not understand why they thought this.

Maybe if Corbyn had said he wanted to stay in the European Union, things would be different. Maybe there would have been no clear winner in the election. Then, they could have made deals to stop Corbyn's worst ideas.

Another leader, Jo Swinson, made a mistake. She said she did not want another vote about the European Union. But her party had wanted another vote before.

But now, this is what happened. We are here now."
67,67_2,2,"The Brexit and Conservative party is going to “deliver” Brexit. But so far from “getting Brexit done”, the election result means that Brexit has only just begun. Is the British public bored by Brexit talk? I am sorry, but there is a lot more boredom in store, and goodness knows how much economic damage from leaving the single market – the creation of which was, ironically, considered by Kenneth Clarke as Margaret Thatcher’s greatest achievement. Happy Christmas!","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

The Brexit party wants to finish Brexit. They say they will ""deliver"" it. But the election result means Brexit is not finished yet. It has only just started.

Are British people tired of hearing about Brexit? I think they are. But I am sorry, there will be more talk about it.

Leaving the single market may hurt the economy. We don't know how much.

The single market was made a long time ago. Kenneth Clarke thought Margaret Thatcher did a good job creating it. That is funny, because we are now leaving it.

Happy Christmas!"
68,68_0,0,"As we wrap up the year, I thought it would be fun to look back at all the columns I have written for the Guardian and pull out the five stories that were my favorites. Why are these my favorites? Mostly because these stories captured the best and worst aspects of running a small business this year. Female-owned businesses: the US economy’s quiet success story A report earlier this year found that 42% of all firms are female-owned and women started 1,817 businesses a day in the past year. My daughter is currently watching Mad Men for the first time and was shocked at how women were treated in the workplace a mere 50 years ago. To me, that just shows how much things have changed. Unfortunately – as I also wrote here – the out-of-date attitudes of some men in positions of power continue to challenge female advancement and opportunities in the workplace. But, there’s still been a lot of progress. As I wrote: “The fact is that women have made significant gains not only in the workplace but in entrepreneurship. Of course there is still a long way to go to achieve equality. But, compared with the data from 10 or 20 years before, there’s no dispute that the environment continues to improve.” Unlimited vacation isn’t as crazy as it sounds – and it can save you money I like reporting on small business news, but I also enjoy sharing good tactics that can help small business owners grow. One of these tactics involves unlimited vacation. 2019 was a year of very tight unemployment and just about every small business owner I know struggled to find and keep good employees. So what about unlimited vacation? Don’t laugh. My report found that unlimited vacation plans can be a potential great benefit and not as costly or as risky as they may seem. As I wrote: “... the vacation benefits you offer should best suit the interests of your employees and your company’s culture. An unlimited paid time-off plan may not be the right thing for your business. But considering some of the potential financial benefits, you should at least be seriously considering it.” Could this be the worst cafe in the world? I know I’m supposed to cover American businesses, but this little restaurant in an out-of-the-way place in New Zealand was too irresistible to ignore. “Just how bad is the customer service at the Springfield Store and Cafe?” I wrote.","It is the end of the year. I want to talk about my favorite stories from my articles in The Guardian. I wrote many articles about small businesses. These five stories are my favorites because they show the good and bad things about running a small business this year.

One story is about businesses owned by women. These businesses are doing well in the US. A report said that 42% of all businesses are owned by women. Women started 1,817 businesses every day last year.

My daughter is watching the TV show ""Mad Men."" She is surprised at how women were treated at work 50 years ago. This shows that things have changed a lot.

But, some men with power still have old ideas. This makes it hard for women to get better jobs. But women have made progress. They have done well at work and in starting their own businesses. We still need to do more to have equal rights. But things are better than they were 10 or 20 years ago.

Another story is about unlimited vacation. It may sound strange, but it can save money. I like to write about small business news. I also like to share ideas that can help small business owners. Unlimited vacation is one of these ideas.

In 2019, it was hard to find workers. Many small business owners had trouble finding and keeping good employees. Unlimited vacation can be a good thing for employees. It may not be as expensive or risky as you think.

I wrote that vacation plans should be good for your employees and your company. Unlimited vacation may not be right for every business. But it can have good financial benefits. So, you should think about it.

Another story is about a cafe. It might be the worst cafe in the world. I write about American businesses. But this cafe is in New Zealand. I could not ignore it.

I wrote, ""How bad is the customer service at the Springfield Store and Cafe?"" It was very bad."
68,68_1,1,"“So bad that people have been reportedly chased out of the cafe and others were forced to leave in tears after being abused by staff members. So bad that the police have actually been called and so bad that some of the local residents boycott the restaurant. ‘It’s an embarrassment to our community,’ one resident said. ‘You don’t have to talk to too many people before you come across somebody who’s had a bad experience there. I want them gone – the whole town wants them gone.’” But what’s interesting is that the cafe continues to thrive. Why? It has decent food and its owner’s behavior draws curiosity. Sometimes even poorly run businesses can succeed, despite their best efforts to fail. Why ‘Slutty Vegan’ became a hit in Atlanta – a city known for its barbecue Speaking of peculiar businesses, this one caught my attention last January because what kind of crazy person sells vegan food in the epicenter of barbecue, Atlanta, Georgia? And kills it! It’s a smart entrepreneur named Pinky Cole, a food truck owner who opened her first brick-and-mortar vegan eatery called Slutty Vegan at the beginning of the year and saw more than 1,200 people line up outside its doors on its very first day. Combining great food with an even better name, Cole’s restaurant has been a hit in 2019, attracting celebrities such as Shaquille O’Neal. She’s also laying the plans for more locations in 2020. No, she will never get me to stop eating meat – but I have to admit it will be tough to resist a Fussy Hussy (it consists of a plant-based patty with vegan cheese, shredded lettuce, onion, pickle and vegan mayo on a Hawaiian bun) the next time I’m in town. What’s the dynamic demographic running America’s small businesses? Older people OK Boomer, you’re still in charge. I’m thrilled for all the female entrepreneurs who are finally making their mark, but can we still give a small shoutout to us old people? The fact is that America’s small businesses are still dominated by people in their 50s and 60s, and if you’re marketing to small businesses, you best not ignore this demographic.","Some people say a cafe is very bad. Some customers say that staff were mean to them. They say the staff shouted at them. Some people even cried and left.

The police came to the cafe because of the problems. Some people who live nearby don't go there anymore. One person said it makes their town look bad. They said many people have had bad experiences. They want the cafe to close. They said everyone in the town wants it to close.

But the cafe is still doing well. This is strange. The food is good, but the owner acts in a way that makes people curious. Sometimes, even bad businesses can do well.

There is a restaurant called ""Slutty Vegan"" in Atlanta. Atlanta is a city that likes barbecue. So, it is interesting that someone sells vegan food there. Vegan food does not have meat.

Pinky Cole is a smart business owner. She had a food truck. Then, she opened a restaurant called Slutty Vegan. On the first day, over 1,200 people waited to get in.

The restaurant has good food and a funny name. It is very popular. Famous people like Shaquille O'Neal eat there. Pinky Cole wants to open more restaurants soon.

I will still eat meat. But the ""Fussy Hussy"" sandwich sounds good. It has vegan cheese, lettuce, onion, pickle, and vegan mayo on a sweet bun. I might try it when I am in Atlanta.

Who owns most small businesses in America? It is mostly older people. People in their 50s and 60s still run many small businesses. If you want to sell things to small businesses, remember the older owners."
68,68_2,2,"According to a survey, 57% of small business owners were born between 1946 and 1964. Sure, millennials are taking over the workplace and will very soon (thank goodness) take over the world. But that’s not going to happen right away and in the meantime it’s the boomers who are still running the majority of our country’s small businesses. I wish I had the time to include more, but there’s eggnog to consume. So for now, have a great new year and see you in 2020 with more stories about and for small business owners. It’s going to be a busy and interesting year for us all.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR level B1:

A study shows that many small business owners are older. 57% of them were born between 1946 and 1964. These people are called ""baby boomers.""

Younger people are now working more. They are called ""millennials."" Maybe soon they will be in charge of everything. But this will not happen now.

Right now, baby boomers still own many small businesses. They run most of the small businesses in our country.

I want to tell you more. But I do not have time now. I want to drink eggnog!

Happy New Year! I will see you in 2020. I will have more stories for small business owners then. It will be a busy and good year for everyone."
69,69_0,0,"In a parallel political universe, Ofwat’s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was announced on Monday. Incoming Labour ministers would instead be inspecting their soon-to-be nationalised assets. None of that will now happen, so the key issue in a still-privatised world is different. Will any of the companies that have bleated behind the scenes about a “politicised” regulatory process dare to allege unreasonable harshness on the part of Ofwat? Will any appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)? We’ll have to wait eight weeks – the permitted period for an appeal – to find out, but the likely suspects would be well advised to swallow their medicine. First, Ofwat’s review is pitched as the “toughest ever”, but so it had to be. Shareholders since privatisation in 1989 have enjoyed a dividend bonanza so this was always going to be a moment to lean in the opposite direction. That’s not evidence of politicisation; it’s just a recognition that regulation has been too lax. Ofwat’s new demands will strike most bill-payers as reasonable: lower returns on capital; a reduction in bills by £50 on average, ignoring inflation, over the next five years; and a 16% cut in leaks. Second, Ofwat has given some ground between its “draft” and “final” calculations. Companies, in aggregate, will be allowed about £1.5bn of extra expenditure to meet performance targets. The concession is not huge in the context of a £51bn spending programme, but it’s a softening. Third, the new regime will only look “tough” to the laggards, judged by efficiency. Note how the share price of Severn Trent, one of three companies that got top-of-the-class “fast track” status during Ofwat’s review, is within pennies of its all-time high. Its shareholders see little to frighten them. Fourth, an appeal to the CMA is not a one-way bet. The competition regulator is allowed to conclude that Ofwat should have been harder.","In another world of politics, the rules about water prices would be different. These rules are for the water companies in England and Wales. Ofwat made these rules for the next five years. In that other world, the Labour party would be in charge. They would take over the water companies.

But that did not happen. So, we have to think about something else. The water companies are still private. They have complained about Ofwat's rules. Will they say that Ofwat is being too hard? Will they ask the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to check?

We need to wait eight weeks to know. This is how long they have to complain. But the companies should accept the rules.

First, Ofwat says these are the ""toughest ever"" rules. They needed to be tough. Since 1989, the owners of the water companies have made a lot of money. So, now it is time to change things. This is not political. It just means the rules have not been strict enough.

Most people who pay water bills will think the new rules are fair. The water companies will make less money. Bills will go down by about £50 over the next five years. This does not include changes because of inflation. There will also be 16% fewer leaks.

Second, Ofwat changed some things between the first and last versions of the rules. The water companies can spend about £1.5 billion more to do better. This is not a lot of money compared to the £51 billion they will spend in total. But it makes the rules a little easier.

Third, the new rules will only seem ""tough"" to the companies that are not doing well. For example, Severn Trent is doing well. It was one of the best companies in Ofwat's review. Its share price is almost the highest it has ever been. The owners of Severn Trent are not worried.

Fourth, complaining to the CMA is not always a good idea. The CMA could say that Ofwat should have been even harder on the water companies."
69,69_1,1,"That thought ought to concentrate minds in the boardrooms of the four companies – Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames and Yorkshire – that are thought most likely to appeal. It’s time for them to accept that, in a privatised but regulated system, owners have to take a hit sometimes. On – then off – the buses It’s hard to keep up with transport firm FirstGroup’s view of its best strategy. Back in May, the “future emphasis” for the group was going to be First Student and First Transit, its two North American bus contractors, since they had “the greatest potential to generate sustainable value and growth over time”. Now both operations may be sold. What’s prompted the U-turn? One can point to the arrival of David Martin as chairman in August but, since he seemed to endorse the May vision only last month, the latest development looks to be a lobbying triumph for activist investor Coast Capital, aided these days by fellow investor Robert Tchenguiz. The duo demanded a sale of all US assets, not just the Greyhound coaching business, a few weeks ago; now they may get it. A UK-only future would be a mighty come-down for FirstGroup, which can currently call itself one of the world’s largest transport companies with 100,000 employees. Indeed, even within the UK, the future of the bus division is unclear, as FirstGroup is exploring what form of “separation” is possible while meeting pension obligations. If the buses were also to exit along with the US assets, all that would be left would be the UK rail business, from which FirstGroup seemed to be contemplating an orderly retreat only a year ago. Then it won the West Coast Partnership franchise and all is now apparently right with rail. One can view this strategic soul-searching as an exercise in “rationalisation”, the polite term for a break-up. It’s hard, though, to escape the feeling that there’s a simpler alternative to uncertain deal-making: just run the businesses better. Going up … ? Mike Ashley has been banging on about his “elevation” strategy for years and now he has something to show for it: a share price that elevated by 31% in a day. Context is everything, however.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

**Water Companies**

Some people are thinking about buying water companies. These companies are Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames and Yorkshire. The bosses of these companies should think hard. They need to know that sometimes they will lose money. This is because they are private, but the government controls them.

**FirstGroup and Buses**

It is difficult to know what FirstGroup wants to do. FirstGroup is a transport company. In May, they wanted to focus on their bus companies in America. They thought these companies would make a lot of money. Now, they might sell these American bus companies.

Why did they change their mind? David Martin became the chairman in August. But he agreed with the plan from May. So, something else must have happened. Some investors wanted FirstGroup to sell everything in America. These investors are Coast Capital and Robert Tchenguiz. They wanted to sell more than just the Greyhound buses. Now, they might get what they want.

If FirstGroup only has businesses in the UK, it will be much smaller. It is now one of the biggest transport companies in the world. It has 100,000 workers. Even the bus business in the UK is not sure. FirstGroup is thinking about how to change it. They need to pay their pensions.

If FirstGroup sells the American businesses and the UK buses, they will only have the UK train business. A year ago, they wanted to leave the train business. But then they won a train contract. Now, the train business is good.

Maybe FirstGroup is just making things simpler. But it seems like they should just try to run their businesses better. It is easier than selling everything.

**Mike Ashley and Shares**

Mike Ashley has been talking about making his company better. Now, his company's shares went up a lot in one day. They went up by 31%. But it is important to know why."
69,69_2,2,"The improvement to 472p merely took the shares back to where they stood at the start of 2016, which is roughly when Ashley adopted his other obsession – diversification. House of Fraser, the main product of that ambition, clearly isn’t getting worse, which was why the shares jumped on Monday. But the eventual returns from the HoF deal remain a mystery. Ashley runs a tighter ship than the old management (no surprise there) but the long-term investment demands in the department store business are anyone’s guess.","The shares went up to 472p. This means the shares are now at the same price as in the beginning of 2016.

Around that time, Ashley started to do other things. He wanted to try new businesses. One of these new businesses was House of Fraser.

House of Fraser is probably not getting worse. That is why the shares went up on Monday.

But we don't know if Ashley will make money from the House of Fraser deal. It is still a mystery.

Ashley is managing the company better than before. That is not surprising.

But nobody knows how much money the department store business will need in the future. It is hard to guess."
70,70_0,0,"With its army of perfectly groomed and manicured shop assistants, the department store beauty hall has traditionally been the backbone of a £2.5bn trade in expensive lipsticks, face creams or perfumes. But cosmetics sales have plummeted this year as high street shutdowns, coupled with the shift to home-working, has prompted many people to ditch their makeup bags. Sales of the designer brands sold via glossy counters in department stores are down by more than 40% this year, a decrease worth almost £500m, according to the market researcher NPD. The decline is even bigger if you throw in the £180m hit to sales of cheaper lipsticks and eyeshadows bought alongside groceries in supermarkets. Women are simply wearing less makeup, said Alexia Inge, the co-founder of the Cult Beauty website. “The lockdown expedited trends that were already happening. People were already starting to take a different approach to makeup from the Insta-glam layer-upon-layer [look].” The so-called “lipstick index” is often used as a barometer of consumer confidence during periods of economic turmoil. The term, which was coined by the former Estée Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder in the early 2000s, refers to the usual resiliency of cosmetics with makeup seen as an affordable indulgence when bigger purchases are out of reach. But the index never saw Covid-19 coming, with its mandatory face-coverings that mean no one can even see your lips, let alone what colour they are. During the lockdown, demand for products many would once have considered an essential part of their daily beauty routine – such as foundation and lipstick – was down by more than 70%. “Everyone likes to roll out Lauder’s lipstick effect … but lipstick sales are probably the worst of any category right now,” said Inge. Instead, she added, we should look at skincare, which is the “makeup equivalent” of the leisurewear people have been wearing at home during the pandemic. While Cult Beauty’s lipstick sales were down 8%, its skincare sales have more than doubled. This dramatic shift in spending priorities is borne out in figures from the department store chain John Lewis.","Big shops called department stores usually sell a lot of beauty products. They have nice shop assistants who sell things like lipstick and perfume. These products are often expensive. They used to sell about £2.5 billion worth of them. This was important for their business.

But this year, they are not selling as much. The shops had to close because of the virus. Also, many people are working from home. So, they are not using makeup as much.

The sales of expensive makeup in department stores have gone down a lot. They are down more than 40%. This is about £500 million less than before.

Even cheaper makeup sold in supermarkets is not selling as well. These sales are down by £180 million. Women are using less makeup now.

A woman named Alexia Inge said that things were already changing. People were starting to use less makeup before the virus. The virus just made this change happen faster. People are not doing ""Insta-glam"" looks anymore.

There is a saying called the ""lipstick index."" It means that when the economy is bad, people still buy lipstick. Lipstick is a small treat when you cannot buy big things.

But the virus changed things. People have to wear masks. So, you cannot see their lips. Because of this, the ""lipstick index"" does not work now.

During the time when everyone had to stay home, people bought much less makeup. They did not buy foundation and lipstick as much. Sales went down by more than 70%.

Alexia Inge said that lipstick is not selling well now. She said that skincare is selling better. Skincare is like the makeup version of comfortable clothes that people wear at home.

Her company, Cult Beauty, sold less lipstick. Lipstick sales went down by 8%. But skincare sales went up a lot. They more than doubled.

The shop John Lewis also saw this change. People are spending their money on different things now."
70,70_1,1,"Its sales of skincare, body and hair products are up 234% this year, as people opt to spend time caring for their skin rather than applying makeup. John Lewis predicts some of the changes seen this year will stay around and that cosmetics bags will get smaller as women abandon lip pencils and contouring sticks – a hard-to-do blending technique popularised by Kim Kardashian – and switch to easy to use multipurpose products, such as tinted moisturiser and lip balm. Long periods at home have driven shoppers into the arms of Cult Beauty and its discount-driven Lookfantastic, which is part of The Hut Group founded by the billionaire Matthew Moulding. In common with other retail markets such as furniture, more than 40% of beauty sales will be online this year – almost double 2019’s level. The failure of a major player like Debenhams, with its 124 stores and 12,000 staff, is a fresh blow for the beauty industry left reeling by this year’s lengthy salon closures. Yes, times are tough for the high street, said June Jensen-Mills, the head of UK beauty at market researchers NPD, but store sales are likely to bounce back in 2021. “I believe that bricks and mortar will go back to being important,” she said. “People will want to meet up with friends, try things, have a coffee. Debenhams is an important player in the world of beauty but when a retailer closes customers shift to similar retailers where they feel at home.” There are also new powerful forces at work in the industry as the glitzy websites of blockbuster brands such as Charlotte Tilbury compete with the department stores that are also their business partners. For shoppers the joy of the beauty hall lies in the ability to discover new brands, trial out textures, test colours and sample scents, but coronavirus restrictions mean that is, in many cases, no longer possible. But department stores brands are fighting back with innovative new ways of selling, such as virtual masterclasses and compiling “discovery boxes” of sample-sized products. People seem to like it.","Sales of skin care items are much higher this year. They are up by 234%. People are spending time on their skin. They are using less makeup.

John Lewis thinks some changes will stay. Makeup bags will be smaller. Women will not use lip pencils or contouring sticks so much. Contouring is a makeup trick. Kim Kardashian made it popular. It is hard to do.

Women will use easy things like tinted cream and lip balm. People have been at home a lot. So, they are shopping at Cult Beauty and Lookfantastic. Lookfantastic is part of The Hut Group. Matthew Moulding started it.

Many beauty products are sold online. It is more than 40% of all sales. This is almost double the sales in 2019. Other things, like furniture, are also sold online a lot.

Debenhams was a big shop. It had 124 stores and 12,000 workers. It closed. This is bad for the beauty business. Salons were closed for a long time this year. That also hurt the beauty business.

June Jensen-Mills works at NPD. She studies the beauty business. She says it is a hard time for shops. But she thinks shop sales will get better in 2021.

She thinks shops will be important again. People will want to see friends. They will want to try products. They will want to have coffee. Debenhams was important. But when it closed, people went to other similar shops.

There are new things happening in the beauty business. Big brands like Charlotte Tilbury have nice websites. They sell things there. Department stores also sell these brands. So, the brands are competing with their partners.

People like going to the beauty section in stores. They can find new brands. They can try creams and colors. They can smell perfumes. But now, it is hard to do this because of the virus.

Department stores are trying new things. They are doing online classes. They are making boxes with small samples. People seem to like these ideas."
70,70_2,2,"Last week John Lewis and Charlotte Tilbury broke the Guinness World Records’ title for the UK’s largest ever beauty masterclass after 10,000 people signed up to “brush along at home” to create a “timeless 90s supermodel-inspired look”. Consumers may be looking for “simplicity” now but their feelings may change in 2021. “I have a strong feeling that once we come out of lockdown, and the bars and discos are open again, things will pick up,” said Jensen-Mills. “People will think ‘I’ve had an awful year and I want to make myself feel and look great’. Let’s just slap on loads of foundation and lipstick.”","Last week, something amazing happened. John Lewis and Charlotte Tilbury did something very big. They made the biggest beauty class in the UK.

About 10,000 people joined the class. They watched at home and learned how to do makeup.

The makeup style was like the models from the 1990s. It was a simple but beautiful look.

Now, people may want simple things. But maybe this will change next year, in 2021.

Someone named Jensen-Mills said something interesting. She thinks things will get better after the lockdown. Lockdown means we must stay home.

She thinks people will want to go out again. They will want to feel good. They will want to look great.

Maybe they will use a lot of makeup. Like foundation and lipstick. They will want to have fun!"

The Japanese carmaker said it was expecting shortages of parts as a result of transport delays, after France’s 48-hour ban on accompanied freight or cargo from Britain led to queues of lorries miles long stuck near Dover. Toyota said it had decided to bring forward the “planned seasonal stop” at its engine plant in Deeside in north Wales and its factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire, where it makes the Corolla. About 3,000 people are employed at the two plants. The Deeside site will close for Christmas on Tuesday and the Burnaston plant on Wednesday. Its French site will also stop production two days earlier than planned. The European factories would ordinarily have closed for an annual shutdown on Christmas Eve and remained shut until 4 January. Toyota said it wanted to “help ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”. The car manufacturer said it had taken the decision “in light of the traffic bans that a growing number of countries have issued for travel from the UK and due to the uncertain nature of how long the borders will be closed for logistics activities”. The extended shutdown caps a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, which halted production in the spring as the first wave of the pandemic took hold. The French government is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday about reopening transport links with the UK. Paris failed to lift its 48-hour ban on freight and passengers from Britain over fears about the new coronavirus strain, despite a phone call on Monday evening between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. France is one of more than 40 countries that have suspended flights and trains from the UK, including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey and Canada. However, the suspension of cross-Channel transport has caused the most disruption in and around British ports, which were already struggling with increased workloads because of the arrival of Christmas goods, companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit and coronavirus restrictions.","Toyota will stop making cars in Britain and France early. This is because of problems with the borders caused by the COVID-19 virus.

The border closures are making it hard to move things. Toyota thinks they will not have enough car parts. This is because trucks are waiting a long time at the border. France stopped trucks coming from Britain for two days. This made long lines of trucks near Dover.

Toyota will close their engine factory in Wales. They will also close their car factory in England. They make Corolla cars in England. About 3,000 people work at these two factories.

The factory in Wales will close on Tuesday. The factory in England will close on Wednesday. The factory in France will also close early.

Normally, these factories close for Christmas on December 24th. They stay closed until January 4th.

Toyota wants to keep their workers safe. They also want to help the companies that move their goods. They are thinking about what is best for everyone.

Toyota decided to close early because many countries have stopped travel from the UK. They do not know how long the borders will be closed.

This has been a difficult year for car companies. They stopped making cars in the spring because of the virus.

The government in France will talk about opening the borders with the UK on Tuesday.

France did not open the border to trucks and people from Britain. They are worried about a new type of the virus. The leaders of Britain and France talked on the phone, but the border is still closed.

More than 40 countries have stopped planes and trains from the UK.

The closed border is causing big problems at the ports in Britain. The ports were already busy. They had more work because of Christmas, Brexit, and the virus."
72,72_0,0,"Shaftesbury, one of the biggest landlords in central London, has slumped to a £700m loss after slashing the value of its portfolio, as the West End braces for tougher Covid-19 restrictions. The company, which owns parts of Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden, has been hit by the sharp fall in the number of tourists and office workers coming into the capital. It said vacancies at its shops, restaurants and offices had nearly tripled to 10.2% in the year to 30 September. As tenants struggled to pay their rent, Shaftesbury’s net income fell by 24% to £74.3 . It collected only 53% of the rent due in the second half of the year. This resulted in an annual loss after tax of £699.5m, compared with a profit of £26m the previous year. Shaftesbury wrote down the value of its portfolio by 18.3% to £3.1bn, as the amount of empty space in the West End increased, rental income fell and physical distancing measures reduced demand from retail and office tenants for more space. Brian Bickell, the Shaftesbury chief executive, said: “Rarely in history has the world seen such widespread disruption to normal patterns of life. Only now are we seeing the first positive signs that conditions will begin to improve in the year ahead.” Shaftesbury said its leasing activity had declined sharply since February due to the pandemic and was below normal levels, although there had been a pickup in inquiries in recent weeks. The pandemic has also forced landlords to rewrite lease agreements to help tenants get through the crisis, and Shaftesbury moved permanently to monthly rents for most commercial tenants from October. The company said its rental and service charge support for tenants was likely to continue through 2021, “with our occupiers having reduced income in the important period leading up to Christmas and into the new year, which traditionally has provided them with liquidity buffers to withstand the normally slower quarter to March”. London is among the areas that enter tier 3 restrictions on Wednesday, which means hotels, pubs, bars and restaurants have to close again and can only do takeaways and deliver. Shaftesbury gave a gloomy outlook for next year, predicting that pandemic control measures were “likely for much of 2021”.","Shaftesbury is a big company. It owns many buildings in London. It lost a lot of money, about £700 million.

This happened because the value of its buildings went down. The West End area of London is getting ready for new rules because of Covid-19. These rules will make things harder.

Shaftesbury owns buildings in Chinatown, Soho, and Covent Garden. Not many tourists or office workers are coming to London now. This is bad for the company.

Many shops, restaurants, and offices in Shaftesbury's buildings are empty. Almost three times more buildings are empty now. 10.2% of their buildings were empty this year.

The people who rent Shaftesbury's buildings are having problems paying. Shaftesbury made less money, about £74.3 million less. This is a 24% decrease.

Shaftesbury only got 53% of the rent they asked for in the last six months. Because of this, they lost £699.5 million this year. Last year, they made £26 million.

The value of Shaftesbury's buildings went down by 18.3%. Now, their buildings are worth £3.1 billion. There are more empty buildings in the West End. People are paying less rent. Shops and offices don't need as much space because of the rules about keeping distance.

Brian Bickell is the boss of Shaftesbury. He said that the world has changed a lot. He also said that things might get better next year.

Shaftesbury said that they are not renting as many buildings as before. This started in February because of the virus. But, more people have been asking about renting in the last few weeks.

Because of the virus, Shaftesbury is helping the people who rent from them. They are changing the rent rules. Now, most shops and restaurants pay rent every month, starting in October.

Shaftesbury will probably keep helping the people who rent from them in 2021. Shops and restaurants will not make as much money before Christmas and in the new year. This is a time when they usually make a lot of money to help them through the slower months.

London will have new rules soon. These rules are called tier 3. Hotels, pubs, bars, and restaurants must close again. They can only sell food to take away or deliver.

Shaftesbury thinks next year will be hard. They think the rules to stop the virus will probably be in place for most of 2021."
72,72_1,1,"Even so, the firm was confident in the West End’s long-term ability to attract visitors. Bickell said: “In the year ahead, the widespread distribution of effective vaccines will bring a gradual return of confidence and activity across the West End and, a recovery in domestic footfall and spending to our villages. “At the present time, it is not possible to predict at what point conditions will improve but it is likely social distancing and other restrictions, with the risk of further lockdowns, will continue into the spring and possibly early summer, putting further financial strain on many of our occupiers.”","The company still believes in the West End. They think it will bring people in the future.

Bickell said something about this. He thinks things will get better next year. Many people will get vaccines. Vaccines will help people feel safe. This will help the West End. People from the UK will come back to visit and spend money.

It is hard to know when things will get better. Maybe we will need to stay away from each other. Maybe there will be other rules. We might even need to stay home again. This could happen until spring or summer. This will make it hard for businesses to make money."
73,73_0,0,"Britain’s economy is suffering increasing damage from the rapid growth in Covid infections, renewed lockdown measures, and turmoil over Brexit at the end of the worst year for growth in three centuries, according to a Guardian analysis. With negotiations going down to the wire amid vast tailbacks at Dover before the Brexit transition expires on New Year’s Eve, the latest figures from the UK economy show stalling growth, falling retail sales, and redundancies rising at the fastest rate since records began. In a month that started with a burst of optimism as a British woman became the first patient in the world to receive the coronavirus vaccine, December is ending with the pandemic surging to a fresh peak and Boris Johnson’s government imposing tougher lockdown measures before Christmas. To counter the emergence of a faster-spreading Covid variant in the UK, and as Brexit talks intensify, the French ban on freight movements has led to chaos in Kent days before a no-deal Brexit could trigger renewed turmoil. Official figures had shown the British economy recovered from lockdown this spring at a faster rate than first anticipated, amid hopes that a vaccine could bring an early end to the crisis. However, economists now forecast a double-dip recession and tougher lockdowns lasting into 2021 before the vaccine can be rolled out widely enough. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Brexit – with or without a trade deal with Brussels – would hit an already weak UK economy at the start of next year. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “It does seem to me to be the worst decision in peacetime any country in the world has made in a thousand years. Lines of lorries at Dover and Folkestone do not augur well for what is to come, even before Boris Johnson cancelled Christmas.” Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries.","The UK economy is having problems. This is because of more people getting sick with Covid. Also, there are new rules because of Covid. Brexit is also causing problems. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union. This year is the worst for the UK economy in 300 years. This is according to a study by The Guardian newspaper.

The UK and the European Union are still talking about Brexit. There are long lines of trucks at Dover. Dover is a city in England where trucks go to France. The UK economy is not growing very much. Shops are selling less. More people are losing their jobs. This is happening faster than ever before.

In December, things started well. A British woman was the first person to get the Covid vaccine. But now, many more people are sick. The government is making new rules to stop the virus.

A new kind of Covid is spreading faster. Because of this, France stopped trucks from the UK. This caused problems in Kent, a county in England. Brexit talks are still going on. If the UK and the European Union don't make a deal, there will be more problems.

The UK economy got better after the first Covid rules. People hoped the vaccine would end the crisis. But now, experts think the economy will get worse again. They think the Covid rules will last until 2021. The vaccine needs to be given to many people before things can get better.

David Blanchflower used to work for the Bank of England. He said Brexit will hurt the UK economy. This will happen even if the UK makes a deal with the European Union. He wrote in The Guardian that Brexit is a very bad idea. He said the lines of trucks in Dover are a bad sign.

The Guardian newspaper is watching the UK economy. They are looking at eight things to see how Covid is affecting jobs and the economy. They are also looking at the FTSE 100, which is a list of the 100 biggest companies in the UK. The world is having a big economic problem because of Covid. The Guardian is also comparing the UK to other countries."
73,73_1,1,"In the past month, there have been some bright spots for the economy, including a recovery in business activity in early December after the second national lockdown in England. Tougher restrictions in the autumn appear to have had less of an impact on growth and jobs than during the first wave of the pandemic. Official figures show Britain’s economy staged a faster recovery in the third quarter of the year than was first estimated, after a rapid return to work after the first lockdown. However, official growth figures also show the economy started sinking towards a double-dip recession even before Covid restrictions were reimposed in November. The Bank of England has warned the economy will shrink in the final months of 2020 and could remain weaker than expected at the start of 2021, as controls are kept in place to handle rising infections before the Covid vaccine can be rolled out widely. In response to the renewed period of economic pain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unexpectedly extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, a month longer than planned. Use of the flagship wage subsidy programme, which has cost the government almost £50bn so far, doubled in November to about 5 million workers, reflects the intense pressure facing companies. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of people being made redundant reached a record high in October, at a time when the government was winding down furlough before a last-minute U-turn to extend the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends. Blanchflower said: “The issue is whether these jobs – many in pubs, clubs and restaurants – return after the furlough payments stop. But many jobs won’t return, if there are long-run changes in behaviour after the pandemic as expected.”","Here is the text rewritten at CEFR B1 level:

The economy has had some good news recently. In December, businesses started to get better after the second lockdown in England.

The rules in autumn did not hurt the economy as much as the first lockdown. The UK economy grew faster in the third part of the year than we thought. This happened after people went back to work after the first lockdown.

But, the economy started to get worse again before the new rules in November. The Bank of England says the economy will get smaller at the end of 2020. It might stay weak at the start of 2021. This is because we need rules to stop the virus until many people get the vaccine.

Because of these problems, Rishi Sunak has made the furlough scheme longer. It will now last until the end of April. This scheme helps pay workers. It has cost the government a lot of money. In November, about 5 million workers used the scheme. This shows that companies are having problems.

Sunak will talk about the economy on March 3rd. He will explain what the government will do next to help.

But business groups say we need more help for companies and workers. They say this is important because of the long lockdown.

Many people lost their jobs in October. This was when the government was stopping the furlough scheme. Then, they changed their mind and made it longer.

Next year, many people might be unemployed. It could be 2.6 million when the furlough scheme stops.

Someone named Blanchflower said many jobs might not come back after the furlough scheme ends. This is because people might change how they live after the virus. Some jobs in places like pubs and restaurants might not exist anymore."
74,74_0,0,"The former owner of Norton Motorcycles will be forced to pay back about £14m missing from the company’s employee retirement fund, after being refused permission to appeal against a pensions ombudsman’s ruling. Stuart Garner, who acquired the classic marque in 2008 and was feted for years by a series of UK government ministers, was told by the regulator in June to refund three retirement funds he controlled as trustee, following an ombudsman ruling that he had acted dishonestly. The ombudsman’s decision followed an investigation triggered by claims brought by 30 members that Garner had repeatedly failed to return their funds when they were due. The Pension Schemes Act requires trustees to transfer pensions within six months of an application. The court’s refusal to entertain Garner’s request to appeal is another blow for the businessman, who appears to have been pushed a step closer to personal bankruptcy. He is already the subject of a personal bankruptcy petition filed by Leicester city council. The repayment of the £14m to the pension holders, the vast majority of whom were never Norton employees, had been on hold while the court considered Garner’s request for permission to appeal. In an August order delaying the payment, Mr Justice Fancourt said: “The sum likely to be payable … is extremely large and it is readily understandable that [Garner] will not be able to pay it and that, as a result, he is liable to be made bankrupt.” In his latest judgment refusing an appeal, however, Fancourt stated: “There could have been no good reason to delay the payment of compensation unless there was compelling evidence that it would be provided by other means within the timescale specified by the ombudsman.” Garner has been granted permission to appeal against a further £180,000 in distress payments to 30 of the scheme’s 228 members, to whom he had repeatedly failed to return funds when they were due. The businessman’s law firm said: “Mr Garner has been granted permission to appeal the inconvenience award, and has renewed his application for permission to appeal in respect of the refusal.” Garner, who was the trustee of three Norton pension funds, invested all of the members’ savings into his own company, but Norton slumped into administration on 29 January.","The old owner of Norton Motorcycles has to pay back money. This money is about £14 million. It belongs to the company's retirement fund for workers.

He tried to ask the court to change a decision about this money. But the court said no. So, he must pay the money back.

His name is Stuart Garner. He bought Norton Motorcycles in 2008. For some years, government people in the UK liked him.

In June, a group said that he must give the money back. He was in charge of the retirement funds. They said he was not honest.

This happened after someone checked what happened to the money. Thirty people said that Garner did not give them their money when he should have.

The law says that people in charge of pensions must give the money within six months when someone asks for it.

The court said no to Garner's request. This is bad for him. It looks like he may have to declare himself bankrupt. This means he may have no money.

Leicester city council has already asked the court to say he is bankrupt.

Garner had to pay the £14 million to the people who had pensions. Most of these people did not work for Norton. He did not pay while the court thought about his request to change the decision.

In August, a judge said that Garner probably could not pay the money. He said that Garner might have to declare himself bankrupt.

But now, the judge said that there was no reason to wait to pay the money.

Garner can ask the court to change another decision. This decision is about £180,000. This money is for 30 people. These people are part of a group of 228 people who had pensions. He did not give them their money when he should have.

Garner's lawyers said that he can ask the court about the £180,000. He also asked the court again to let him change the first decision.

Garner was in charge of the Norton pension funds. He used all the money from the pensions to invest in his own company. But Norton had problems and closed on January 29."
74,74_1,1,"The ombudsman’s determination in the summer stated: “The trustee has acted dishonestly and in breach of his duty of no conflict, his duty not to profit and his duty to act with prudence.” The decision followed a Guardian and ITV News investigation in January that showed how 228 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares after they had been duped by a fraudster. Garner received the retirement savings during 2012 and 2013, after a scam that resulted in a promoter, Simon Colfer, being convicted of fraud in 2018 for the way he had sold the scheme. Two further Garner associates involved in setting up the Norton pensions schemes, Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley, were convicted of a separate tax fraud in 2013, when they reclaimed £5m of tax rebates from fictitious pension contributions. Court documents from that trial show that £990,000 of the fraud proceeds were loaned to Garner to acquire Norton in 2008. Garner denies wrongdoing and has said he considers himself a victim because he did not know he was dealing with fraudsters.","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR B1 level:

In the summer, the ombudsman made a decision. The ombudsman said the trustee did not act honestly. The trustee did not do his job well. He had a conflict of interest. He made money when he should not have. He did not act carefully.

This happened after an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News in January. The investigation showed that 228 workers lost all their pension money. Their money was used to buy Norton shares. They were tricked by a bad person.

Garner got the pension money in 2012 and 2013. A scam happened before this. A man named Simon Colfer sold the pension plan in a bad way. He was found guilty of fraud in 2018.

Two other people were involved with Garner. Their names are Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley. They helped set up the Norton pension plan. They were found guilty of tax fraud in 2013. They took back 5 million pounds in tax. They said they paid money into pensions, but this was not true.

The court documents showed something else. They showed that Garner borrowed money to buy Norton in 2008. He borrowed 990,000 pounds. This money came from the fraud.

Garner says he did nothing wrong. He says he is a victim. He says he did not know he was working with bad people."
75,75_0,0,"Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are much more likely than white people to work in hospitality, one of the sectors hardest hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic as restaurants, bars and other venues have been shut for months during the lockdowns. About one in 12 (8%) workers from BAME backgrounds are employed in hospitality roles. That compares with about one in 20 (5%) white British workers, research from the Resolution Foundation shows. Overall, 300,000 people from BAME backgrounds work in hospitality. The thinktank’s report found that even before the pandemic hit, hospitality was one of the lowest paying sectors in the economy, with a typical hourly pay of £8.72. It said that 23% of hospitality workers were paid at or below the national living wage. The research found that BAME workers in the sector also faced “pay penalties” – pay gaps that account for workers’ age, qualifications, experience, and the kinds of jobs they do – relative to white British workers. “Crucially, these pay penalties are bigger than the raw pay gaps found in official earnings data – suggesting that the extent of disadvantage is bigger than previously thought,” the report said. BAME men were paid 65p an hour less than white British men on average, the report found. BAME women were also underpaid compared with white British women but the gap was less severe. The report found that while hospitality as a whole disproportionately employed young people – over a third of its workforce were aged 16-24 – this was not always the case for BAME workers. For example, the typical age of a Bangladeshi worker in hospitality was 42 – higher than the typical age for Bangladeshi workers across the whole economy (35), and higher than white British workers in hospitality (28). Indian workers in hospitality were among the highest paid ethnic group per hour (£8.96) and among the most likely to be in high-paying occupations (28%) such as hotel and restaurant managers. This corresponds with 41% of Indian hospitality workers holding a degree. In comparison, one in four Bangladeshi hospitality workers had no qualifications and typically earned 12% less than Indian hospitality workers, at £7.85 an hour.","People from Black, Asian and other ethnic groups (BAME) often work in restaurants and hotels. These places are called ""hospitality.""

The pandemic was very bad for hospitality. Restaurants and bars were closed for a long time. So, many people lost their jobs.

More BAME people work in hospitality than white people. About 8% of BAME workers are in hospitality. Only 5% of white British workers are in hospitality.

About 300,000 BAME people work in hospitality.

Before the pandemic, hospitality was not a high-paying job. The average pay was about £8.72 per hour. Some people earned even less than the living wage.

BAME workers in hospitality are sometimes paid less than white workers. This is even when they have the same age, skills and experience. This means BAME people face more problems than we thought.

BAME men earn less money per hour than white British men. The difference is about 65p per hour.

BAME women also earn less than white British women. But the difference is smaller.

Many young people work in hospitality. More than a third of workers are between 16 and 24 years old. But this is not always true for BAME workers.

For example, many Bangladeshi workers in hospitality are older. The average age is 42. This is older than other Bangladeshi workers (35). It is also older than white British workers in hospitality (28).

Indian workers in hospitality often earn more money. They earn about £8.96 per hour. Many of them have good jobs like manager. About 41% of Indian hospitality workers have a degree.

Bangladeshi workers in hospitality sometimes earn less. One in four has no qualifications. They earn about £7.85 per hour. This is about 12% less than Indian workers."
75,75_1,1,"Nye Cominetti, the senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “As workers from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately likely to work in hospitality, a significant number of workers risk moving into unemployment when the furlough scheme ends in the spring. “The government should bear that in mind for the jobs support programmes it is providing.” A report by the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association and the consultancy Oxford Economics has previously warned that 291,000 jobs in the hospitality trade could be lost as a result of coronavirus restrictions. The forecast was based on industry data suggesting that 25% of pubs could close, with the remainder barely breaking even as they struggle to cope with reduced custom and limited opening hours. Oxford Economics said the worst-case scenario would reduce the sector’s economic output by £7.4bn and cut wages by £3.9bn.","Nye Cominetti works for the Resolution Foundation. He is an important economist there. He said something about workers.

Some workers are more likely to work in jobs like hotels and restaurants. These workers are often from BAME backgrounds. BAME means Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic.

Many of these workers might lose their jobs. This could happen when the furlough scheme ends in the spring. The furlough scheme is when the government pays some of the workers' wages.

Nye Cominetti thinks the government should remember these workers. The government should help them with job support programs.

The British Beer & Pubs Association and Oxford Economics wrote a report. They said many jobs could be lost in the hospitality trade. The hospitality trade is about hotels, restaurants, and pubs.

They think about 291,000 jobs could be lost. This is because of the coronavirus rules.

They think many pubs might close. About 25% of pubs might close. The other pubs might not make much money. It is hard for them because they have fewer customers. They also have to close early.

Oxford Economics said things could be very bad. The economy could lose £7.4 billion. Workers could lose £3.9 billion in wages."
76,76_0,0,"Family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain &amp; Co has handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened their closure. Brains, whose pubs are mainly based in south and west Wales, said it had come “under significant financial pressure” during the pandemic, as restrictions mean pubs must remain closed except for takeaway and delivery. The company closed its entire pub estate on 4 December after the announcement of a ban on alcohol sales and enforced 6pm closing across Wales to try to contain a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Remaining open under those restrictions was “not a viable option”, Brains said. SA Brain &amp; Co was established in 1882 in Cardiff, and became Wales’s biggest brewer and pubs company while remaining under family ownership. John Rhys, the company chairman who oversaw the deal, is the great-grandson of founder Samuel Arthur Brain. Before the pandemic, the pubs included in the deal made £14m a year in core earnings. Marston’s will take over the pubs in February, mostly under 25-year leases from Brains. The annual rent on the pubs was £5.5m. The pubs will be run under the Brains brand, and will continue to sell its beer, which is brewed at a facility in Cardiff Bay that was opened in March 2019. Before that Brains was made in breweries in Cardiff’s city centre. Rhys said: “We know and trust Marston’s to be excellent custodians of our pubs and, while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we are confident that our pubs and our pubs teams will thrive under their stewardship. “Furthermore, this transaction enables Brains to recapitalise its balance sheet and continue its long heritage as an independent entity, preserving this great Welsh business for generations to come.” Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, runs about 1,400 pubs across the UK, including 106 in Wales. The 1,300 employees in Brains pubs will transfer to Marston’s, which employs a further 14,000 people across the UK.","A Welsh company called SA Brain & Co owns many pubs. These pubs are mostly in south and west Wales.

The company is a family business. It has been running for a long time.

But the coronavirus made things very hard. The pubs had to close because of the rules. They could only sell drinks to take away.

This made the company lose a lot of money. It was hard for them to keep going.

So, SA Brain & Co made a deal with another company called Marston's. Marston's will now run the 156 pubs.

This will save the jobs of 1,300 people who work in the pubs. If Marston's did not help, the pubs might have closed.

The boss of SA Brain & Co is John Rhys. He is the great-grandson of the person who started the company.

Before the coronavirus, the pubs made a lot of money each year. It was about £14 million.

Marston's will start running the pubs in February. They will rent the pubs from Brains for 25 years. The rent will be £5.5 million each year.

The pubs will still be called ""Brains."" They will still sell Brains beer. The beer is made in Cardiff Bay.

John Rhys said that he trusts Marston's to take good care of the pubs. He believes the pubs and the workers will do well with Marston's.

He also said that this deal will help Brains get back on its feet. It will help the company stay in business for a long time.

Marston's owns about 1,400 pubs in the UK. They also own 106 pubs in Wales.

The 1,300 people who work in Brains pubs will now work for Marston's. Marston's has 14,000 workers in the UK."

The deal will also keep a Welsh company safe. This company is important in Wales. It is old and special. The deal will help it stay Welsh and not change too much."
77,77_0,0,"Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite an overall drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home prompted consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres. Data from Barclaycard shows spending at independent food and drink shops, including off-licences, butchers and bakeries, jumped 28.6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, total consumer spending fell 7.1%, as social distancing rules left shoppers with fewer opportunities to spend on overseas holidays, hospitality and in city centres. Barclaycard, which covers nearly half of the UK’s credit and debit card transactions, found that while spending on essential goods such as groceries rose by 4.1% compared with 2019, non-essential spending fell 11.3%. Department stores were particularly hard hit, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. However, bricks and mortar discounters had a 25.4% increase, as Britons facing furlough and job cuts sought value for money deals. Consumers forced to spend more time at home turned to DIY projects to spruce up their living space. Pent-up demand after the reopening of non-essential shops in June pushed overall spending at DIY and home goods stores up 9.8% for the year.

But some small, local shops did better than before.
This happened even though people spent less money overall.

The Covid virus made it hard to travel.
Many people worked from home.
So, people shopped in their local areas instead of big cities.

Barclaycard has information about how people spent money.
They found that people spent more money at small food shops.
These shops include places that sell beer, meat, and bread.
Spending at these shops went up by 28.6% in 2020.

But overall, people spent 7.1% less money than before.
This is because it was hard to go out and shop.
People could not go on holidays or visit restaurants as much.

Barclaycard said that people spent more money on things they needed.
For example, they spent 4.1% more on food from the supermarket.
But they spent 11.3% less on things they did not need.

Big shops called department stores had problems.
Spending there went down by 17.2%.
Shops that sold clothes also had problems.
Spending there went down by 15.6%.
This made it hard for some shops to stay open.

But shops with cheap prices did well.
Spending there went up by 25.4%.
This is because some people lost their jobs.
They wanted to find good deals.

People spent more time at home.
So, they started doing projects to fix up their houses.
When shops opened again in June, people bought things for their homes.
Spending at home improvement shops went up by 9.8%.

Shops that sold furniture also did well.
Spending there went up by 5.3%.
People bought big things for their homes.

People also bought flowers for themselves and their friends.
Spending at flower shops went up by 22.7%.
People spent more money on crafts and hobbies.
Spending there went up by 9.8%.
People also spent more money on their pets.

But restaurants had a difficult time.
The government tried to help with a special offer.
But restaurants still had problems.
Spending at restaurants went down by 47%.
Bars and pubs also had problems.
Spending there went down by 36.7%.

But people ordered more food online.
Spending on takeaway food went up by 49.1%.
More people used meal services that send food to their homes.
Spending on these services went up by 62.4%.

People also spent more money on things to do at home.

E-commerce has seen huge growth, working from home has meant many are shopping more locally, and experiences within the home, such as virtual workouts, have become the norm.” Travel spending, including on airlines and travel agents, tumbled 61.1% in August and 63.1% in September, as coronavirus restrictions and quarantine rules took their toll. “Hopefully with a vaccine being rolled out in 2021 we will see green shoots for the most severely impacted sectors,” Ahmed said. “Having said that, some of the trends and changes we have seen in customer habits may be here to stay.”","Online shops did very well. People spent 52.5% more money in these shops.

Raheel Ahmed works for Barclaycard. He said that 2020 changed many things quickly.

More people are buying things online. This is because of the changes. Working from home means people buy things near their houses. People are also doing things like online exercise at home.

Travel spending went down. People spent less money on planes and travel agents. It went down 61.1% in August and 63.1% in September. This is because of the virus rules. People had to stay home after traveling.

Ahmed hopes things will get better in 2021. He hopes the vaccine will help the travel companies. Some of the new ways people buy things may stay for a long time. He thinks some of these changes might not go away."
78,78_0,0,"The plus-size clothing brand Evans has been bought out of administration in a £23m deal that will result in the closure of all its stores and concessions with the potential loss of hundreds of jobs . The chain is the first part of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group to be sold off, marking the beginning of the breakup of his fashion empire, which also includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, plans to operate Evans, which made sales of £26m online and via wholesale last year, as an online-only brand. That will mean the closure of more than 100 Evans concessions and outlets within other Arcadia stores. Five standalone stores will permanently close with the loss of 25 jobs. The concessions and other outlets will not close immediately but hundreds of jobs are at risk at those outlets. Arcadia, which employs 13,000 people at about 500 outlets, collapsed into administration last month as high street lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic piled on pressure after years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. Bids for all the brands are due to be filed on Monday, with Topshop expected to attract offers of up to £200m. Bidders are thought to include the online specialist Boohoo, the fashion and homewares group Next, and Authentic Brands, the owner of the US department store Barneys. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, is also thought to be interested in the smaller Arcadia brands. Administrators from Deloitte said on Monday there had been “significant expressions of interest for all brands”. They said they did not expect to provide a further update on the process until January. City Chic Collective said it had bought Evans as part of a plan to extend its portfolio of plus-size brands, which include City Chic and Hips &amp; Curves, into Europe. It operates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it bought the Avenue brand last year. The company already had a relationship with Evans, which has sold City Chic products via its website for the past five years. “Our vision has always been to lead a world of curves,” said Phil Ryan, the chief executive of City Chic Collective.","A company called Evans sells clothes for plus-size women. Evans had money problems. Now, another company called City Chic Collective has bought Evans for 23 million pounds.

This means that all Evans shops will close. Many people may lose their jobs.

Evans was part of a bigger group called Arcadia. Arcadia has other shops like Topshop and Dorothy Perkins. The man in charge of Arcadia is Sir Philip Green. Evans is the first shop from Arcadia to be sold. This is the start of Arcadia being broken up.

City Chic Collective is from Australia. They want to sell Evans clothes only online. Last year, Evans made 26 million pounds from online sales.

More than 100 Evans shops inside other Arcadia stores will close. Five Evans shops that are separate will also close. 25 people will lose their jobs in these shops. Many more jobs are at risk in the Evans shops inside other stores.

Arcadia has many shops and workers. But Arcadia had money problems. This was because of the coronavirus. The shops had to close. They also had problems selling things before, because other shops like Boohoo and Primark sold similar things.

Other companies want to buy the other shops in Arcadia. Topshop might be sold for 200 million pounds. Companies like Boohoo, Next, and Authentic Brands want to buy them. Mike Ashley's company, Frasers Group, might also buy some smaller shops from Arcadia.

The people in charge of selling Arcadia said many companies are interested in buying the shops. They will give more news about this in January.

City Chic Collective bought Evans because they want to sell more plus-size clothes in Europe. They already sell clothes in Australia, New Zealand, and America. They bought another brand called Avenue last year.

City Chic Collective and Evans already worked together. Evans sold City Chic clothes on their website.

The boss of City Chic Collective, Phil Ryan, said they want to be the best at selling clothes for plus-size women."

79,79_0,0,"Retail sales fell by 3.8% in November on the previous month as the coronavirus lockdown in England and restrictions elsewhere in the UK shut much of the high street. Ending a six-month run of rising sales, the figures revealed the impact of the pandemic on the sector as the infection rate increased across the country. A 19% fall in clothing sales followed the closure of most department stores and non-essential shops. A government message that workers should stay at home if they could caused car journeys to slump and petrol sales to follow suit, with a 16.6% decline. The only bright spot for retailers was an increase in the sale of household goods of 1.6% as shoppers went online to stock up for Christmas. Supermarkets and food stores increased sales by 3.1%. Analysts said it was no surprise the lockdown bolstered online shopping to a record total of 31.4% of all spending, after an increase of almost 75% since November 2019. The Office for National Statistics said 90% of businesses continued to trade in some form through the month, mostly via a click-and-collect service. But only 68.8% of department stores continued trading. Meanwhile, many online retailers reported a boom in sales, as they did during the UK-wide lockdown in spring, though heavy discounting helped to keep the tills ringing. The ONS said this week price-cutting by clothing retailers last month pushed UK inflation down to 0.3%, from 0.7% a month earlier. The Bank of England’s inflation target is 2%. Aled Patchett, the head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: “November’s sales highlight once again the polarising effect of Covid-19 on retail. Sectors like grocery and homeware perform well – and should be expected to have a strong finish to the year – while others including big-name high street brands fall foul of significantly reduced footfall. “Despite most shoppers having wrapped up their Covid Christmas shopping online this year, shops – particularly in smaller towns – will be hoping that the vaccine rollout inspires greater consumer confidence in the new year as people return to city centres for both work and play.” In October, a 6.4% increase in online sales spurred a 1.2% rise in the total volume of retail spending, mainly driven by shoppers rushing to buy early Christmas presents before the second lockdown in England.","In November, shops sold less things. Sales went down by 3.8% compared to last month. This is because there was a lockdown in England. Some other places in the UK also had rules that closed many shops.

Sales had been going up for six months. But now, the virus has made things bad for shops. More people were getting sick in the country.

Clothes shops sold much less. Sales went down 19%. This is because many big shops and other shops that sell things that people do not need were closed.

The government said people should work from home if they can. So, people did not drive their cars much. Petrol sales went down too. They went down by 16.6%.

But some shops did well. Shops that sell things for the house sold more. Sales went up 1.6%. People bought things online for Christmas. Supermarkets and food shops also sold more. Sales went up 3.1%.

Experts said it was not a surprise that online shopping was popular. It was the highest ever, with 31.4% of all shopping. Online shopping has gone up a lot since last year. It went up almost 75% since November 2019.

The Office for National Statistics said that most shops were still open in some way. About 90% of shops let people buy things online and pick them up. But only 68.8% of big shops were still open.

Many online shops sold a lot. This also happened when the UK was in lockdown before. They had sales with low prices to sell more.

The Office for National Statistics also said that clothes shops had low prices last month. This made prices in the UK go down to 0.3%. Before, they were 0.7%. The Bank of England wants prices to go up by 2%.

Aled Patchett from Lloyds Bank said that the virus is making things good for some shops and bad for others. Shops that sell food and things for the house are doing well. But shops that sell other things are doing badly because not many people are going to the shops.

He also said that people are buying Christmas presents online. Shops hope that the vaccine will make people feel better. They hope people will go back to the city to work and have fun.

In October, online sales went up a lot. This made all sales go up by 1.2%. People were buying Christmas presents early because they knew there would be another lockdown in England."
79,79_1,1,"Lee Lucas, the chief executive of the Fashion Retail Academy, which has partnerships with some of Britain’s biggest retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Next, said he was not surprised the November lockdown triggered a fall in clothing sales. “November is one the busiest months of the year for retailers, so this emergency measure by the government will have been directly responsible for the unusually high level of discounting currently in stores, with shops fighting for every consumer in the briefest of run-ups to Christmas.”","Lee Lucas is the boss of the Fashion Retail Academy. This school works with big shops in Britain. Marks &amp; Spencer and Next are some of them.

Lee Lucas said he was not surprised that clothes sales went down in November. This happened because of the lockdown.

80,80_0,0,"The UK public’s appetite for eating out has plunged to its weakest since the spring amid growing evidence of the impact of the Omicron variant on the hospitality sector during its crucial pre-Christmas period. The number of seated diners fell by 14 percentage points in the week ending 20 December to 88% of the level in the same period of 2019, before the start of the pandemic, according to the weekly digest of flash economic indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Using data from the online restaurant booking site OpenTable and other sources, the ONS said Britons were eating out less and working from home more in response to rising infection rates and the government’s plan B measures. Amid widespread reports of bookings being cancelled, the drop in the number of diners in the latest week was the sharpest since early September and the lowest level since restaurants reopened indoors in England, Scotland and Wales in May after last winter’s lockdown. It was also the first time the weekly comparison with 2019 has dropped below 100% since May. Restaurants in London have been especially hard hit by Omicron, with the number of diners in the latest week falling 18 points to 57% of the level in the same period of 2019. In Manchester, despite an eight-point drop on the week, the number of diners stood at 104% of the level in the run-up to Christmas 2019. The ONS said the number of firms reporting staff working from home in the latest two weeks had risen by two points to 14%, with a marked impact on businesses reliant on consumers. Transactions at Pret a Manger sandwich outlets were lower in the week ending 16 December than in January 2020 in six of seven urban locations, with London again the most affected city. While trade in regional towns remained above pre-pandemic levels, sales in the capital dropped by 29 points to barely 50% of the January 2020 level. The ONS report showed retailers doing less badly than restaurants, with footfall in the latest week 81% of its 2019 level – a drop of only one percentage point. Credit and debt card payment purchases were up 4% on a year ago. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced an emergency £1bn package to help businesses struggling with the impact of Omicron.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

People in the UK are not eating out as much. This is the worst it has been since the spring. This is because of the Omicron virus. It is affecting restaurants before Christmas.

The number of people eating in restaurants went down. It went down by 14%. This was in the week ending December 20th. It is now 88% of what it was in 2019. 2019 was before the virus started. This information comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). They look at the economy every week.

The ONS uses information from OpenTable and other places. OpenTable is a website for booking restaurants. The ONS said people are eating out less. They are also working from home more. This is because there are more people getting sick. The government also has new rules to stop the virus. These are called ""Plan B"".

Many people are cancelling their restaurant bookings. The number of people eating in restaurants went down a lot this week. It was the biggest drop since September. It is the lowest number since restaurants opened again. Restaurants opened in England, Scotland, and Wales in May. They were closed because of the virus last winter. This is also the first time the numbers have gone below 2019 since May.

Restaurants in London are having a hard time. The number of people eating in restaurants went down by 18%. It is now 57% of what it was in 2019. In Manchester, the number of people eating in restaurants is better. It went down by 8%. But it is still 104% of what it was before Christmas in 2019.

The ONS said more people are working from home. 14% of companies said their staff are working from home. This is 2% more than before. This is making it hard for businesses that need customers.

People are buying less from Pret a Manger. Pret a Manger sells sandwiches. In six cities, sales were lower than in January 2020. London is the worst. Sales in London went down by 29%. They are only 50% of what they were in January 2020.

Shops are doing better than restaurants. The number of people going to shops is 81% of what it was in 2019. This is only a small drop. People are using credit cards more. They are buying 4% more than last year.

81,81_0,0,"Ikea has increased the price of its flat-pack furniture by up to 50%, blaming supply chain costs caused by Covid-19, in a move that will further stoke growing concern about the rising cost of living. After customers complained that prices appeared to have risen sharply after Christmas, the retailer said it was no longer able to absorb increased costs and was passing them on to consumers. An Ikea spokesperson tweeted: “Unfortunately, there has been a significant increase in costs across the supply chain, including in raw materials, transport and logistics. As this is still ongoing, it is necessary to increase prices across many of our products.” Archived versions of Ikea’s website from as recently as October showed significant price increases, including a Malm desk that has gone up from £99 to £150, a jump of more than 50%. A Jokkmokk table with four chairs is also up 50%, from £99 to £149, compared with earlier this year. A Hemnes daybed has gone up from £215 to £279, a 30% rise, while an Alex nine-drawer unit increased 35% from £85 to £115, according to archived versions of the Ikea website from earlier this year. A Kura children’s bed was up by 14% from £129 to £150, while Ikea’s Klippan sofa, one of the Swedish store’s most popular items, is £20 more expensive – a rise of 11% – at £199. Ikea confirmed that the company had raised prices across multiple countries and ranges. A spokesperson said: “Since the start of the pandemic, Ikea has managed to absorb the significant cost increases experienced across the supply chain while keeping prices as low and stable as we possibly can. Now, like many other retailers, we have had to raise our prices to mitigate the impact on our business. “Price increases vary but remain in line with what we are seeing globally at Ikea, which is approximately a 9% average increase across countries and the product range. Affordability remains at the heart of our business, and our focus will always be on continuing to offer quality, sustainable home furnishings at an affordable price for the many people.” Ikea warned earlier this year that prices would rise, citing factors including bottlenecks in shipping raw materials from Asia to Europe.","Ikea sells furniture that you build yourself. Recently, Ikea made their furniture more expensive.

Some prices went up a lot, as much as 50%. This means things now cost much more money.

People are worried because the cost of living is going up. It is becoming more expensive to buy things.

Customers said that Ikea prices went up a lot after Christmas. Ikea said that it costs more to make and move their furniture.

Ikea said they can't pay for these extra costs themselves anymore. So, they are making customers pay more.

An Ikea person wrote online that it costs more for materials, transport, and moving things. They said prices for many things will go up.

Old versions of the Ikea website show that prices have changed. A desk called Malm used to cost £99. Now it costs £150. This is more than 50% more expensive.

A table with chairs called Jokkmokk used to cost £99. Now it costs £149. This is also 50% more.

It blamed a profit warning on factory shutdowns in Vietnam, clogged ports and extended shipping times. Rising prices at Ikea come amid broader concern about the cost of living, after UK inflation hit a 10-year high of 5.1% in November.

82,82_0,0,"The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices. The energy industry believes the crisis, during which more than 26 energy suppliers have gone bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. Other interventions the industry would like to see considered include extending fuel grants and moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation. Trade body Energy UK said on Thursday that consumers could expect their bills to soar by as much as 50% from 1 April. While wholesale prices continue to climb steeply, the UK’s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers. The price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been at a record £1,277 Since 1 October. Ofgem is expected to raise the cap significantly on 1 April. EDF has said the cap could hit £2,000 by next October, when the cap is reviewed again. Analysts at Investec believe the expected bill increase in April would add 1.8 percentage points to inflation next year. On Thursday, the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the expected £600 rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up. One plan being formulated by the energy industry to would involve a government-administered loan scheme to spread the impact of the price increases over several years.","The government will have important meetings soon. These meetings are with the people in charge of the biggest energy companies in the UK.

Energy companies say there is a big problem in the country. They think energy bills could go up a lot. Bills could go up by more than 50%. This means some people could pay £2,000 a year.

Kwasi Kwarteng is in charge of business for the government. He will talk to the energy companies online on Monday. The energy companies want the government to help. They want the government to do something about the high cost of energy for people. The cost of gas has gone up a lot. This is why energy bills are going up.

Many energy companies have closed down. This has cost £1.8 billion so far. The energy companies think the government could make things better. They want the government to stop charging VAT on energy bills. VAT is a tax of 5%. The UK had this tax when it was part of Europe.

The energy companies also want the government to give people more money for fuel. They also want the government to pay for green energy in a different way. Green energy is good for the environment.

Energy UK is a group that speaks for energy companies. They said that bills could go up a lot from April 1. They said they could go up by as much as 50%.

The price of gas is still going up. But the UK has a limit on how much energy companies can charge. This limit is called a price cap. The companies cannot charge people more than this limit right away.

Ofgem sets the price cap. Ofgem is in charge of the energy industry. The price cap is now £1,277. It has been this price since October 1. Ofgem will probably raise the price cap a lot on April 1.

One energy company, EDF, thinks the price cap could be £2,000 by next October. They will check the price cap again then.

Some experts think that if bills go up in April, the price of things in the shops will also go up. This could make things 1.8% more expensive.

Ed Miliband is in charge of energy for the other main political party. He wants the government to stop people from paying so much for heating and electricity. He wants the government to stop charging VAT on energy bills for six months.

Spain has also cut taxes on energy. Germany has also cut costs for green energy for people's homes.

Energy UK says these things will not save people much money. They said it will save less than £300. But bills could go up by £600 a year.

The energy companies have a plan. They want the government to give them money. Then they will not have to raise bills so much at once. They can raise them slowly over many years."
82,82_1,1,"The plan would involve one or more commercial lenders – such as banks – covering the immediate cost of buying energy on wholesale markets at record prices, with a sum of at least £7bn. The loans would not require a government guarantee, but officials would be responsible for ensuring repayments. “We regularly engage with the energy industry and will continue to ensure that consumers are protected through the energy price cap, which is insulating millions from record global gas prices,” a government spokesperson said. “We also continue to support those most in need through our £500mhousehold support fund, the warm home discount and winter fuel payments.”","Here is the text rewritten at a CEFR B1 level:

83,83_0,0,"On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gave a mid-year economic update predicting a solid economic bounceback from Covid restrictions. We’ve looked under the hood to see what the treasury’s crystal ball says is in store for the economy, what might go wrong, and how government finances will fare if they’re right. Forecasts The budget papers project the Australian economy will grow in real terms by 3.75% in 2021-22 and 3.5% in 2022-23, before easing back to 2.25% and 2.5% in the final two years of the forward projections. The unemployment rate is tipped to fall to 4.25% in that time. The treasury thinks Australians will be ambitious with their pay demands and bosses generous in a bid to keep workers, because wages growth is supposed to take off from 2.25% in 2021-22 to 3.25% in 2024-25. Inflation is projected to reach and stay at the mid-point of the reserve bank’s target range (2.5%) in 2022-23. Assumptions The treasury has assumed that with more than 80% of Australians aged 16 and above now vaccinated, rates will climb to more than 90%. So far so good. But the rest of the assumptions are … a little rosy. The treasury assumed lockdowns will no longer be required, with “most domestic activity restrictions” lifted by the start of 2022 and only basic density restrictions in place. There may be “temporary strengthening of activity restrictions” to contain localised outbreaks – but these short, sharp lockdown-like restrictions are assumed to have no material impact on the outlook. Remaining state border restrictions are assumed to be lifted by early 2022 and the Omicron variant “is not assumed to significantly alter current reopening plans or require a reimposition of widespread health and activity restrictions”. Migrants will start returning from 2022, with international students ready to go for the first semester of next year. What could go wrong In a word: Covid. If a new variant of concern emerges (beyond Omicron) requiring more significant health responses, the international border could be closed for another six months and public health orders and precautionary behaviour could drive down spending.","On Thursday, a man named Josh Frydenberg talked about the economy. He said the economy will get better after the Covid problems. He thinks things will be good for the economy.

We looked at what the government thinks will happen. We wanted to know what the future might be like for the economy. We also wanted to know what problems could happen. We checked how the government will do with money if the predictions are right.

The government thinks the economy will grow. It will grow by 3.75% this year. Next year, it will grow by 3.5%. After that, the growth will be a little slower. It will be 2.25% and then 2.5% in the next two years.

The government also thinks fewer people will be without jobs. The number of people without jobs will go down to 4.25%.

The government thinks people will want more money. They think bosses will give workers more money to keep them working there. So, wages will increase. This year, wages will grow by 2.25%. In a few years, wages will grow by 3.25%.

The government thinks prices will go up a little. The price increase will be 2.5% in 2022-23. This is the middle of what the bank wants.

The government is making some guesses about the future. They think that most people will get the vaccine. They think over 90% of people will get it.

But the other guesses might be too good to be true. The government thinks there will be no more lockdowns. They think most rules will be gone by the start of 2022. There will only be a few simple rules.

Maybe there will be some small rules to stop the virus in some places. But the government thinks these small rules will not hurt the economy.

The government thinks the borders between states will open soon, by early 2022. They also think the new virus, Omicron, will not change the plan to open up. They think it will not make the government put back the old rules.

The government thinks students from other countries will come back in 2022. They will be ready for school next year.

What could go wrong? Covid. If a new virus comes, it could be bad. If the new virus needs more rules to stop it, the borders could close again. People might be scared and not spend money."
83,83_1,1,"The treasury projects this could mean 1% is shaved off gross domestic product in 2021-22, and unemployment is about 1% higher. The rebound would instead come in the second half of 2022. The papers also note that revenue assumptions and nominal GDP are also sensitive to changes in the iron ore price, with a US$10 fall shaving $3.9bn off GDP this year and $0.9bn off tax receipts next financial year. If the government has to pay higher interest rates on bonds, then debt could blow out by a further 5.4% of GDP by 2032. $16bn of mystery spending The budget papers reveal that there is about $16bn of mystery spending over the next four years, consisting of decisions taken but not announced, or measures for which the cost is not-for-publication. That’s more than 10 times the size of mystery spending last year. The papers make it impossible to calculate the size of the war chest for announcements to be made before the election, by mixing in a bunch of commercially sensitive spending items like vaccine purchases. But a treasury official in the lockup suggested it was about half and half … so, an $8bn war chest for the election. There will also be $940m more revenue collected due to decisions taken but not announced or not for publication measures. Debt and deficit For a government previously concerned with the debt and deficit disaster, there is still red as far as the eye can see. The deficit is tipped to be $99.2bn in 2021-22, an improvement of $7.4bn since the budget despite the Delta lockdowns. The deficit will still be $57.5bn in 2024-25 (or 2.3% of GDP), and only shrinks to 1.8% of GDP in 2031-32. Net debt is projected to be 30.6% of GDP at June 2022, rising to a peak of 37.4% in 2025, then down to 35.5% in 2032. The papers say that despite the economic recovery the government is sticking with the first plank of its budget plan – strong and sustained recovery – so don’t expect austerity measures to try to cut the debt and deficit.","The government thinks the economy will be a little worse. This could mean the country makes 1% less money in 2021 and 2022. Also, more people could be out of work, about 1%.

The economy should get better in the second half of 2022. The price of iron ore is important. If the price goes down by $10, the country will make $3.9 billion less this year. Next year, the government will get $0.9 billion less in taxes.

The government sells bonds to get money. If the government has to pay more interest on these bonds, the country's debt could get much bigger. It could be 5.4% more of the country's money by 2032.

There is also some money that is not explained. The government will spend about $16 billion over the next four years. We do not know what it is for. It is much more than last year.

It is hard to know how much money the government has for the election. They have mixed it with other spending, like buying vaccines. But someone from the government said about half of the $16 billion could be for the election. That would be $8 billion.

The government will also get $940 million more money. This is because of decisions they made, but did not tell people about.

The government used to worry a lot about debt and not having enough money. But they still do not have enough money. The country will be short $99.2 billion in 2021 and 2022. This is a little better than before.

In 2024 and 2025, the country will still be short $57.5 billion. This is 2.3% of the country's money. In 2031 and 2032, it will be 1.8%.

The country's debt is getting bigger. It will be 30.6% of the country's money in June 2022. In 2025, it will be 37.4%. Then it will go down to 35.5% in 2032.

The government says the economy is getting better. But they will still try to make the economy strong. They will not try to save money and cut the debt right now."
84,84_0,0,"Britons are many times more likely to have experienced shortages of food and fuel than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll. Global supply chain problems prompted by the pandemic have disrupted the international trade network since the summer, with transport backlogs combining with labour shortages to create scarcities of various goods around the world. The government has argued that the shortages are part of a worldwide pattern and no worse in the UK than elsewhere, although logistics experts and other professionals – particularly in the food sector - have said the problems are amplified in Britain by a shortage of east European workers, including drivers, since Brexit. The YouGov poll showed residents of the UK were multiple times more likely to have experienced, or to know people who have experienced, shortages of food and fuel than people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, and somewhat more likely to have experienced them than those in the US. Asked in early December whether they had personally experienced any scarcity of foodstuffs in recent weeks, 56% of respondents in the UK said yes, while 9% said they had not personally experienced any but knew people who had. The corresponding figures in the US were 49% and 10%, but in continental Europe, the proportion of people who said they had been personally affected was between three and nine times lower: 18% in Germany, 16% in France, 12% in Sweden, 8% in Denmark, 7% and 6% in Italy. The proportion saying they knew people who had experienced food shortages ranged from 13% in France to 8% in Denmark and Italy – where 58% of respondents said they were not even aware that supply chain problems had led to food shortages. The UK was also the only country where substantial numbers of people said they had experienced fuel shortages in recent weeks, since the crisis in September and October. One in three Britons (33%) said they had personally experienced a recent scarcity of fuel, compared with no more than 10% in any other country. Only 8% of German respondents, 7% of those in France and 5% of those in Italy said they had been personally experienced fuel scarcity, with 37%, 38% and 53% respectively saying they had not even heard of the issue – compared with just 11% of respondents in Britain.","Here is the rewritten text, targeting a CEFR B1 (Elementary) level:

A survey asked people about food and fuel. It showed that people in the UK had problems getting food and fuel more often. This happened more than in some countries in Europe.

The problem is about how things are moved around the world. This problem started because of the sickness. It made it hard to move things. There were not enough workers to move things. This made it hard to find some things.

The UK government said that this problem is all over the world. They said the UK is not worse than other places.

But some people who know about moving things disagree. They said the UK has more problems. This is because there are fewer workers from Europe since Brexit. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union.

The survey asked people if they had problems getting food. It also asked if they knew people who had problems. 56% of people in the UK said they had problems getting food. 9% said they did not have problems, but they knew people who did.

In the USA, 49% of people said they had problems. 10% said they knew people who did.

In some countries in Europe, fewer people had problems. 18% of people in Germany had problems. 16% of people in France had problems. 12% of people in Sweden had problems. 8% of people in Denmark had problems. Only 7% of people in Italy had problems. And 6% in Spain.

Some people in Europe knew others with food problems. 13% of people in France knew someone. 8% of people in Denmark and Italy knew someone. But in Italy, 58% of people did not even know there was a problem with food.

The UK was also the only country where many people had problems getting fuel. This happened in September and October. One in three people in the UK (33%) had problems getting fuel. In other countries, much fewer people had problems. In Germany, only 8% had problems. In France, only 7% had problems. In Italy, only 5% had problems.

Also, many people in Europe did not know about the fuel problem. 37% of people in Germany did not know. 38% of people in France did not know. 53% of people in Italy did not know. In the UK, only 11% of people did not know about the fuel problem."

From January, Just Eat customers will be able to add a range of products to their baskets starting with five Asda stores, with the exact locations to be announced in the new year. “We live in an on-demand world,” said Andrew Kenny, the UK managing director of Just Eat. “We want to make sure we are getting our customers the food they want, when they want, when they want it. Our tie-up with Asda means we can help people access everything from store cupboard essentials to fresh groceries in a matter of minutes.” Just Eat follows rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats, which already have fast delivery deals with some of the UK’s biggest supermarkets. Best-known for restaurant and fast food delivery, Just Eat said that up to 1,000 grocery items would be made available for customers to order seven days a week. The two companies anticipate the partnership to be extended to more Asda stores throughout next year. The partnership builds on an existing relationship, with Just Eat delivering pizzas and meal deals from Asda Kitchen, the grocer’s indoor cafe and diner, which operates at 42 locations nationwide. “We’re always looking for new ways to offer customers more choice and extend the number of delivery options available,” said Simon Gregg, the vice-president of online grocery at Asda. “The trial will also see Asda become more accessible to a wider customer base through Just Eat’s significant presence in the on-demand food delivery space.” Just Eat has more than 60,000 restaurant partners it offers a delivery service for, covering 95% of the UK. The food delivery service has more than 10,000 grocery and convenience store partners on its platform internationally, including brands such as Spar, Shell and 7-Eleven. Last month, Asda appointed Stuart Rose, the Conservative peer and former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, as chairman.","Just Eat is now selling groceries. They are working with a big shop called Asda.

86,86_1,1,"The FTSE 100 is wavering around a 1.1% decline for the day - perhaps it is waiting for direction from the UK cabinet, which is about to meet. However, any leaks (or indeed official messages) are likely to come very near the end of the trading day, if not after. The Dax in Germany is down by 1.8% and France’s Cac 40 has lost 1.1%. The Stoxx 600, which combines all of the above and more, is down by 1.5%. Britain’s largest pub chain JD Wetherspoon has appointed two employees to its board in response to criticisms of its corporate governance. Four out of about 100 managers of Spoons pubs were chosen after shareholders and employees said it would “benefit from having more pub experience at board level”, the company said on Monday. Debbie Whittingham, a regional manager for the West Midlands, and Hudson Simmons, area manager for Sheffield, will join the board, while another two will be “associate employee directors”. Tim Martin, Wetherspoon’s founder and chairman, has previously lashed out at those who have criticised the company’s corporate governance in lengthy letters published on the stock market’s news service. However, he said: Pub and area managers, and other members of pub teams, have always participated in weekly decision-making meetings, which distil suggestions from the ‘front line’. The appointment of employee directors will extend this approach to board meetings and will help to preserve the culture of the company for the future. It was cautiously welcomed by the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance. Luke Hildyard, the High Pay Centre’s executive director, said: The perspectives workers directors can offer in terms of improvements to customer service and employee relations are obvious. The new Wetherspoons directors would have more credibility and independence if they’d been elected by colleagues rather than appointed by existing board members and it should also be remembered that boardroom representation is a complement not a substitute for full trade union rights and recognition. But this is a positive step by Wetherspoons that will benefit both workers and shareholders in the long term. One to watch on the UK politics front: the prime minister has called a cabinet meeting at 2pm.","The FTSE 100 is going down. It has gone down about 1.1% today. Maybe it is waiting to see what the UK government will do. The UK government is meeting soon.

The Dax in Germany is also down. It is down by 1.8%. The Cac 40 in France is down too. It has lost 1.1%.

The Stoxx 600 is a mix of many European companies. It is down by 1.5%.

A big pub company in Britain is called JD Wetherspoon. People said the company needed better leaders. Now, two workers will join the board of directors. This means they will help make important decisions.

The company chose four managers from their pubs. Shareholders and workers said this would be good. They said it would help to have more people with pub experience on the board.

Debbie Whittingham is a manager in the West Midlands. Hudson Simmons is a manager in Sheffield. They will join the board. Two other workers will also help as ""associate employee directors.""

Tim Martin is the boss of Wetherspoon. He did not like people criticizing the company before. He wrote long letters about it.

But now he says that workers have always given ideas. They talk about things in meetings every week. Now, workers will also be in board meetings. This will help the company keep its good culture.

A group called the High Pay Centre thinks about pay and leaders. They think this is a good thing.

Luke Hildyard works at the High Pay Centre. He said that workers on the board can help the company. They can make customer service and worker relations better.

He thinks it would be better if workers voted for the new directors. Now, the current leaders chose them. He also said workers should have a union. But he thinks this is a good first step for Wetherspoons. It will help workers and shareholders.

86,86_2,2,"As Andrew Sparrow points out on the Guardian’s UK politics live blog, there is not usually a cabinet meeting on a Monday, so this is an emergency coronavirus meeting. Dress codes and wine pairings have not yet been released. You can follow updates on the cabinet here: One for the central bank watchers: Germany’s new government has picked a new head of its central bank: “career central banker” Joachim Nagel. Nagel’s predecessor, Jens Weidmann, was perhaps the European Central Bank’s most prominent internal critic -arguing against the stimulus that it has used to prop up the EU economy. (All eurozone central bank heads get a place on the governing council, which sets monetary policy for the bloc.) Nagel, a former Bundesbank board member, will take over on 1 January. Reuters summarised his recent career as: A former board member of the state-owned development bank KfW Bank, Nagel currently works for the Bank for International Settlements, which is often considered the central bank of central banks. Early in his career, he was also a consultant for the SPD, the party that took over government earlier this month and will make the Bundesbank appointment one of its first decisions. Germany’s finance minister under the new coalition government, Christian Lindner, said on Monday: In view of inflation risks, the importance of a stability-oriented monetary policy is growing. He is an experienced personality who ensures continuity at the Bundesbank. The World Economic Forum at Davos has been postponed to the summer because of concerns about the coronavirus variant, it said on Monday. The event, usually held every year at the Swiss ski resort, was scheduled for 17 to 21 January 2022, but will instead happen in “early summer”. In January the World Economic Forum will instead run online meetings. Davos usually serves as an occasion for many of the world’s most powerful people from the realms of business, economics and politics to gather and pontificate about the world’s problems. However, the meeting of thousands of people from all over the world has been difficult to continue during pandemic conditions. The 2021 event was cancelled in favour of online events in the summer.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

There is news about a meeting. Andrew Sparrow wrote about it in a blog. The blog is about UK politics. Usually, the cabinet does not meet on Mondays. This meeting is special because of the coronavirus. It is an emergency meeting. We do not know what people will wear or what they will drink.

You can read updates about the cabinet meeting online.

Here is some news about Germany. Germany has a new government. The new government has chosen a new head for the central bank. The new head is Joachim Nagel. He has worked at the central bank for a long time.

The old head was Jens Weidmann. He often disagreed with the European Central Bank. He did not want the bank to help the EU economy.

All the heads of the central banks in Europe are on a council. This council decides about money for all of Europe.

Joachim Nagel used to be on the board of the Bundesbank. He will start his new job on January 1st.

Reuters wrote about Joachim Nagel. He used to work for a bank called KfW Bank. He now works for the Bank for International Settlements. This bank is like a central bank for all central banks. He also helped the SPD party. This party is now in charge of the government. They will choose the new head of the Bundesbank. This is one of the first things they will do.

Christian Lindner is the finance minister in Germany. He said it is important to have stable money. He said Joachim Nagel has experience and will keep things the same at the Bundesbank.

The World Economic Forum in Davos will not happen in January. It will happen in the summer. This is because of the coronavirus. People are worried about the new type of coronavirus.

The meeting was planned for January 17 to 21, 2022. Now it will be in the early summer. In January, there will be online meetings instead.

Many important people go to Davos. They are from business, money, and politics. They talk about the world's problems.

It is hard to have the meeting with many people from all over the world because of the coronavirus. The meeting in 2021 was cancelled. There were online meetings in the summer instead."
86,86_3,3,"In a statement, the event’s organisers said: Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting. Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary. The number of shoppers across British high streets fell over the weekend before Christmas, according to new data from Springboard that show people spurned city centre shopping during what should have been the biggest weekend of the year. Retail footfall was 19% down for the week ending on Saturday compared to the equivalent in 2019, Springboard said - although it was higher than December 2020, when the UK government dramatically u-turned to put in place a Christmas lockdown. Shopping centres fared particularly badly, with footfall down by 27% on 2019, but high streets were also down by a fifth on 2019. Retail parks, which are generally accessed by private car and are often open-air, performed slightly better. Weekend traffic overall fell compared to the previous weekend by 8.5% in Central London and by 6.4% in cities outside of the capital. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: The nervousness of shoppers about making in-person shopping visits inevitably meant that large city centres lost out to smaller high streets, particularly over the weekend when footfall declined from the week before in Central London and large cities outside of the capital whilst rising in market towns. There has been a bit of movement on currency markets as well this morning: sterling is down by 0.4% against the US dollar. One pound will buy $1.3195. That in itself is not a huge move, but it puts the pound perilously close to its lowest level since December 2020, when the UK was facing the prospect of belated Christmas restrictions in the hope of limiting the spread of a new coronavirus variant (a familiar tale). If it drops below $1.3165 it will mark a new low for 2021, an unusual situation considering the Bank of England only just last week shocked markets with an interest rate rise - pre-empting the Federal Reserve. However, the Fed has itself also made it clear that it will tighten the US money supply. The prospect of a series of interest rate rises next year has made the dollar more attractive to investors.","The people who planned the event said something. They said it is hard to have a meeting with people from all over the world now. This is because of the virus.

They had rules to keep people healthy at the meeting. But the new type of virus spreads very easily. It also makes it hard for people to travel. So, they have to move the meeting to a later time.

Many people did not go shopping in British towns before Christmas. This information comes from a group called Springboard. They said people did not shop in city centers. This was during the busiest weekend of the year.

The number of shoppers was less than in 2019. It was 19% less for the week that ended on Saturday. But it was more than in December 2020. At that time, the government changed its mind and had a Christmas lockdown.

Shopping centers did not do well. There were 27% fewer shoppers than in 2019. High streets also had fewer shoppers. It was 20% less than in 2019.

Shopping parks did a little better. People can drive to them and they are often outside.

There was less traffic on the weekend. Traffic in London went down by 8.5%. Traffic in other cities went down by 6.4%. This is compared to the weekend before.

Diane Wehrle works for Springboard. She said shoppers were worried about going to shops. Big city centers had fewer shoppers. Smaller towns had more shoppers. This was especially true on the weekend. Fewer people went to London and big cities. More people went to smaller towns.

The money market changed a little today. The British pound is worth less than before. It is down 0.4% against the American dollar.

One pound is worth $1.3195. This is not a big change. But the pound is close to its lowest value since December 2020. At that time, the UK might have had Christmas rules to stop the virus.

If the pound goes below $1.3165, it will be the lowest value for 2021. This is surprising. The Bank of England just increased interest rates last week. They did this before the American Federal Reserve.

But the Federal Reserve also said they will make less money available in the US. People think interest rates will increase next year. This makes the American dollar more attractive to people who invest money."
86,86_4,4,"Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the dollar will be, pace the omicron variant, one of the “winners from global growth” during 2022. There has also been a similar bounce on oil markets. The price of Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, is still down by 3.3% today - but that is a recovery from earlier. Brent crude futures were down by as much as 5% earlier this morning, with one barrel for February delivery going for as little as $69. It is now back at $71.30. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, an investing platform, said: Heavy selling has hit the oil markets again this week with WTI and Brent crude both shedding more than 3% extending losses after a week in the red with Brent already ending down 2.6% as the Omicron variant continues to spread, weighing on the demand outlook and market sentiment. The Netherlands’ latest lockdown from Sunday sparked investor concerns of fresh restrictions in Europe and the US to curb the spread of Covid, prompting fears of a near-term economic slowdown. Brent crude has shed more than 17% from the October high, trading in a descending trendline and retracing around 70% of its prior gains from the August trough. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Société Générale, a bank, is in a festive mood - albeit the wrong feast. “It’s a lot more like Halloween than Christmas,” he said: Oil prices, equity indices and bond yields are lower on a mix of omicron concerns and Senator Joe Manchin’s announcement that he won’t vote for President Biden’s spending bill. Just over half an hour after the FTSE 100 slumped further, it has just regained a percentage point. It is now down by just 1.3% at 7,179 points, having earlier dropped by as much as 2.2%. European stocks have also recovered somewhat: Germany’s Dax is now down by 2.2% and France’s Cac 40 is down 1.4%. All the usual disclaimers apply at this point in the year: a fair few investors will have shut up shop for the holidays, and few of those who remain will have planned any major moves in the absence of central bank activity.","Mark Haefele works for UBS. He is in charge of investments. He thinks the dollar will do well in 2022. This is because of global growth. The Omicron virus could change things.

Oil prices have also moved up a little. Brent crude is a type of oil. It comes from the North Sea. Its price is down 3.3% today. But it was lower earlier.

This morning, the price of Brent crude was down 5%. One barrel for February cost $69. Now, it costs $71.30.

Victoria Scholar works for an investment company. The company is called interactive investor. She says that people are selling a lot of oil this week. The prices of WTI and Brent crude are both down more than 3%. They were also down last week.

The Omicron virus is spreading. This makes people think there will be less demand for oil. It also makes people feel worried.

The Netherlands has a new lockdown. This started on Sunday. Investors are worried that other countries will also have new rules. They worry that Europe and the US will slow down the spread of Covid. This could make the economy slow down too.

The price of Brent crude is down more than 17% since October. The price has been going down. It has lost about 70% of the money it made since August.

Kit Juckes works for a bank. The bank is called Société Générale. He is not happy. He says it feels like Halloween, not Christmas.

Oil prices are down. Stock prices are down. Bond yields are down. This is because of Omicron. Also, Senator Joe Manchin will not vote for President Biden's spending bill.

The FTSE 100 is a group of big companies. Their value went down. Now, it has gone up a little. It is down by 1.3%. It is at 7,179 points. Earlier, it was down by 2.2%.

Stocks in Europe have also gone up a little. The Dax in Germany is down by 2.2%. The Cac 40 in France is down by 1.4%.

Many investors are not working because of the holidays. The investors who are working are not planning to do much. They are waiting to see what the central banks will do."
86,86_5,5,"That means that there will be lower liquidity and fewer buyers to soak up any sales, so moves can be exaggerated. Nevertheless, that is a notable swing over the course of less than an hour. It may have been partly helped by vaccine maker Moderna. It said on Monday (in an interview published at 10am GMT) that a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to offer protection against the omicron variant. Reuters reported: The vaccine maker said the decision to focus on the current vaccine, mRNA-1273, was driven in part by how quickly the recently discovered variant is spreading. The company still plans to develop a vaccine specifically to protect against Omicron, which it hopes to advance into clinical trials early next year. “What we have available right now is 1273,” Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer, said in an interview. “It’s highly effective, and it’s extremely safe. I think it will protect people through the coming holiday period and through these winter months, when we’re going to see the most severe pressure of Omicron.” Some detail on how the UK’s shops fared over the last week - usually one of the the strongest of the year: it was not great. Footfall on and near London’s Oxford Street, the country’s biggest shopping district, was 17% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the New West End Company, which represents about 600 shops. Shopping was 5% below the previous weekend, and across the entire week of the 13th December footfall was down by 29% compared with 2019’s figures. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said businesses were “disappointed” with how the weekend went: With less than five days to go until Christmas day and the probabilities of a circuit-breaker lockdown increasingly on the horizon, the retail and leisure sector is now facing a huge amount of financial uncertainty when it should be enjoying a much needed shot in the arm. We are therefore backing the #BusinessBooster campaign and calling on the government to provide urgent and swift financial support. Temporary measures such as a 100% business rate relief for the first quarter of the year, extension of the VAT reduction and introduction of grants could be the difference between viable businesses avoiding closures and job losses in the new year.","It looks like there is less money to buy and sell things. Also, there are not many buyers. So, when things are bought or sold, the prices can change a lot.

Something important happened in less than one hour. The company Moderna, which makes vaccines, may have helped. On Monday, they said their vaccine can protect against the Omicron virus. This was in an interview that started at 10am GMT.

Reuters said that Moderna will use their current vaccine, called mRNA-1273. This is because the Omicron virus is spreading fast.

The company will still make a special vaccine for Omicron. They want to test it early next year.

Dr. Paul Burton from Moderna said that the 1273 vaccine is good now. He said it works well and is very safe. He thinks it will protect people during the holidays and winter. Omicron will be a big problem then.

We also have some news about shops in the UK. Usually, the last week before Christmas is the best week for shops. But this year, it was not good.

Many people shop on Oxford Street in London. It is the biggest shopping area in the country. But this week, there were 17% fewer people than before the virus. This information comes from the New West End Company. They represent about 600 shops.

Shopping was also 5% less than the week before. For the whole week of December 13th, there were 29% fewer people than in 2019.

Jace Tyrrell is the boss of the New West End Company. He said the shops were ""disappointed"" with the weekend.

Christmas is very close. There is a chance the government might close shops again. This makes it hard for shops to know what to do. They need money now, but they are not getting much.

The New West End Company supports the #BusinessBooster campaign. They want the government to give money to shops quickly.

They want the government to help in a few ways. For example, they want shops to pay less tax at the start of next year. They also want the government to give shops money. This could help shops stay open and keep people from losing their jobs in the new year."
86,86_6,6,"The FTSE 100 sell-off has accelerated - it is now down by 2.2%. It has hit the lowest level since the start of December as concern over the spread of the omicron variant ramp up. While the UK government is fielding a lot of questions about parties, the hospitality industry is trying to put the pressure on over the lack of them, given how the current lockdown-lite has affected their bookings. The Guardian’s Joanna Partridge writes: Pubs and restaurants have warned of plummeting sales and “decimated” bookings, as pressure increases on the government to offer urgent financial support to struggling hospitality businesses. The weekend just passed should have been the busiest trading period of the Christmas season, but customers chose to stay away, said Nick Mackenzie, the chief executive of the pub and brewery chain Greene King, which runs 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK. “Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, some parts of the country we are 70%, 80% down on 2019, so the situation is pretty unsustainable,” Mackenzie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. Warnings from the government had led to “lockdown in all but name”, Mackenzie said, and he urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to deliver “quick and effective support”. You can read the full report here: Some interesting detail from the notice detailing the reasons for the errors Standard Chartered made. One key reporting problem was caused by a spreadsheet error in which a workers put the wrong sign - so it read as positive rather than negative. Sure, we all make that kind of mistake, except in this case the error meant the calculation was out by a staggering $10bn. That sounds like a very bad day at the office indeed. Standard Chartered will have to pay £46.5m after it failed to cooperate with regulators at the Bank of England. It was a record fine imposed by the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is tasked with overseeing the UK banking sector’s financial stability. The fines came in relation to reporting errors related to movements of US dollars, amid concerns in October 2017 about the outflow of cash.","The FTSE 100 is falling. It is down by 2.2%. This means it is lower than it has been since December. People are worried about the Omicron virus spreading.

The UK government is being asked about parties. Businesses like pubs and restaurants are also asking for help. They are losing money because people are not going out. This is like a small lockdown, but it is hurting their business.

A writer named Joanna Partridge says that pubs and restaurants have much lower sales. Bookings are very bad. They want the government to give them money quickly.

Last weekend was usually the busiest time for Christmas. But people stayed home. Nick Mackenzie runs a company with many pubs and restaurants. He said that business is very bad.

He said that some places are losing 70% or 80% of their money compared to 2019. He told the BBC that this is not good.

Mr. Mackenzie said the government told people to stay home. This made it like a lockdown. He wants the government to help businesses soon.

Standard Chartered bank made a mistake. A worker used the wrong sign in a computer program. This made a big mistake. The mistake was worth $10 billion.

This was a very big mistake. Standard Chartered must pay money because of it. They have to pay £46.5 million. They did not work well with the Bank of England.

The Bank of England gave them a big fine. This bank watches over the money of UK banks. The fine was for mistakes in reporting money. The mistakes were about moving US dollars in 2017."
