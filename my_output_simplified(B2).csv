Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and climbed to the top of the world’s top, but even he can’t remember a Latin American year like 2019.

Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","Long-standing tensions have been growing for years.

Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later.

In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago.","Protesters in Iraq stormed the American Embassy in Baghdad.

Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters.

The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time.

A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said.","The Hungarian mangalica pig has existed for nearly two hundred years.

3,3_1,1,"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight.

So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure.

This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism.

5,5_0,0,"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February.

Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels and warned that assets in the sector could be “worthless”.

This included work at the United Arab Emirates embassy in Moscow. His father told the Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition. The competition was organised by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group. This group was revived in 2009. It was revived by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich was an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club. Manyurov did there. Solovich said he was a ""poor shot."" He used to come to the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with the hood up."

8,8_0,0,"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries.

Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes.

You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick.

12,12_0,0,"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. The pandemic hit in March. The country locked down all the cities. The elephants could no longer walk 30 miles a day. These walks were important for stretching their legs and helping them digest. Health problems began to come in, worsened by a glum mood that kept people and animals at the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many were sad. They were not getting exercise and entertainment from tourists. The tourists used to walk with them, wash them and play with them. The tourists also took beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even more worries because he relied only on the income and donations from tourists. Elephants eat up to 200kg of food every day. This is 10% of their body weight. Feeding one elephant costs up to 5,000 rupees a day. That's about £51. Pareek has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. He said they didn't want the elephants to suffer. Elephants only deserve love and respect. So they have borrowed money to cover the food costs. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive.

12,12_1,1,"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","Covid has ruined all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.""

For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun.

13,13_0,0,"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","The theory that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples.

The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Hospitals could soon face ""horrendous choices"" about which Covid-19 patients can receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so overloaded, doctors fear.

Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been.

The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business.

15,15_1,1,"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","This may happen.

Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has made people find – or remember – that books are very good companions. ""I can't speak for everyone, but among my friends, a lot of people got too tired watching TV series,"" Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet reading areas, a very needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Ona sells books only in Catalan. Finestres will open in spring. Both are new outlets. They have set themselves up as places to meet and read, and to buy books. Both have been funded by local philanthropists. Morral wants them well. He knows these bookshops are relative minnows. They will have to fight with Amazon. ""What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and a sense of what book you've bought and what you might like, rather than having an algorithm tell you what to read next,"" he said."
16,16_0,0,"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory.

The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus.

What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987.

19,19_0,0,"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind.

22,22_0,0,"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","An Afghan former BBC journalist who flew to the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only BBC employee to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir worked for the World Bank and the former Afghan government. He wanted to start a new life with his family after leaving Afghanistan. They escaped in early October with help from a US charity. Now they are stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven. They are well looked after. But they can't go more than 100 meters from the building. Also, the UAE will not accept their asylum applications. Kadir is angry at the UK government's repeated refusals. They have refused to help him. He still fears he will be sent back to Afghanistan. His work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban there. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s failure highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and unable to travel anywhere willing to grant them refugee status.

22,22_1,1,"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office denies this. A spokesperson said the ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in the country. It will give up to 20,000 more people a new life in the UK. These people are at risk. ""We are working at speed to open the scheme, with a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme."" It refuses to discuss individual cases. The Home Office is working on a system. This system is for collecting biometric data and checking eligibility. It is to ensure accepted people are not a threat to security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same situation, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive is Minnie Rahman. She spoke three months ago. The government said it would welcome Afghan refugees ""warmly"". Now there's little welcome. The British government abandoned many Afghans. This was shameful. They still have clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open. Family reunions are very limited. Our government can't help many who risked their lives working with us. They urgently need this shelter. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “While progress on the resettlement process is slow, journalists are living in fear and being forced into hiding. All Afghans at high risk need safe passage to the UK. BBC spokesperson said: ""We have all sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not able to support them directly."" Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.”"

There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","The world faces many challenges.

Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is.

India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort.

More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish.

Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue.

The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda.

23,23_7,7,"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","But in 2021’s snap election, his Liberals won the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting Trudeau’s magic is not working. Disputes swirl over corruption. There are also disputes about pandemic management. Other disputes are with the US. Finally, there are differences over carbon reduction policy. Some of 2022's biggest themes will play out across Africa. Africans are still not vaccinated. They may pay a huge, unnecessary price. This is because the developed world is monopolizing vaccines and is reluctant to share surpluses and patents. They will also suffer from the many health and economic effects of the pandemic. This question also raises another: will such selfishness return to the wealthy north, as Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The pandemic's path in 2022 is unknown. This includes the threat to health. It also includes the threat to economic prosperity. Many African countries have very young people. These people are less likely to suffer from severe Covid. The biggest problem may be the negative impact on other diseases. This is about the management of those diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases and others, such as TB and diabetes, may worsen as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least according to many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The Sahel countries have seen a rise in radical Islamist groups. These groups are mostly home grown. They often say they are allegiance to global networks. These networks include al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts may become more organized in 2022. Their focus is to counter the rise in jihadist violence."

Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought.","This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had stopped French military operations in Mali because of lack of support.

Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing.

Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).

Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”.

Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement.

Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, said of the loss the whole country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu's death was another chapter of bereavement for the nation. He said it's part of our goodbye to a generation of outstanding South Africans. That generation gave us a free South Africa. This comes after the last apartheid-era president, FW de Klerk, died in November. ""Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa needed a courage that cannot be described,"" said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Tutu had mostly disappeared from public life in recent years. He had been fighting for things he believed in. He fought for LGBT rights. He also supported equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric had an infectious laugh and an open heart. These traits matched a strong commitment to his principles. He had also been fiercely criticised of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party."

The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment.

27,27_0,0,"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of the International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness.

The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","Memorial spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities.

28,28_0,0,"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","Some local administrations in Spain have become the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to balance workplace demands and periods pains.

28,28_1,1,"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union.

29,29_0,0,"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has set a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with many countries hitting new highs.

Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”.

We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border.

A video was published on Monday. It was filmed near Bakhmut. Two Wagner soldiers insult Valery Gerasimov, the chief of general staff. This will further fuel speculations about tensions within the Russian forces. ""You are ... the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,"" one of the men says. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin said he liked the soldiers' actions, saying he went to Bakhmut to meet them. ""The guys asked me to tell them that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,"" Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine said Russia had moved some of its aircraft from the Engels airfield. Moscow said the airfield was hit by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier. That strike killed three Russian servicemen. ""After yesterday's well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation ... Of course, there are some planes still there, but many of them have already been moved to different airfields,"" said Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command. In other words, Russia’s security services said they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident shows how Ukrainian saboteurs are still working in Russia. Military targets have been damaged since the start of the war. Oil depots and weapon depots have been damaged. They caught fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks in Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as a reward."

The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China.

Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers.

33,33_0,0,"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","As 2022 began, while parts of the world were struggling with Covid and a war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm.

The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn.","""Xi may think he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China forward, but he is actually taking China into uncharted territory.""

33,33_2,2,"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October.

Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track.

As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled.

The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","China is planning another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance to meet after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. Hundreds of millions of workers are going home. Many will take the disease with them. They are going to areas with less hospitals and clinics. These areas also have less doctors, less equipment, and less money for care. There is also a wide gap in understanding public health. The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, says the British health analytics company Airfinity, and could affect even more people than the one running through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda about Covid. The virus was a threat to be avoided at all costs, but now Chinese people are told it's nothing like a cold. That means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly help overwhelmed hospitals."
34,34_1,1,"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","As such, I would expect a huge death toll, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, of 1 million.'.
