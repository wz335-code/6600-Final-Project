They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music.

They were young and old. Some were fit and some were not. They all wanted to lose weight. I don't think they thought about running before. Or if they did, they thought running was hard and hurt. They did not think about talking and laughing while running in nice places, like next to a river. At first, they could only run for one minute. Now they can run for thirty minutes.

But the note itself is only a printed piece of paper which costs almost nothing to make. Thousands of years ago, people didn't have money as we know it. There were no banks or even shops. In those days, Mr Green the farmer exchanged the com he had grown for Mr Hive's honey. This was an exchange arranged between two people, each of whom had something that the other wanted.

There are over 9,000 different types of grasses and they are found in every region on the earth. They are the single flowering plants that can exist in the freezing environment of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands support a wide range of animal life, from tiny insects and birds to huge animals like cows and lions. All of them depend on grass in one way or another. Grass recovers very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, the new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top of the plant. That is why large families of animals are able to live together in one area. As soon as they have eaten all the grass there, a fresh meal is always available because the plants start to grow again.

During the brief Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a full- size passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over the continent of Antarctica and back. Flight dates for next year are not definite yet, but if you make a booking now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the day. Questions These are answers to the most frequently asked questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights. How long is the flight? The average flight is 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, Antarctica experts who have lived on scientific research stations there give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera next to the pilot, which is linked to the video system on board, gives you a pilot's eye view throughout, from take-off to landing. Will I get a seat next to a window? All passengers are given two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, passengers are asked to move to the seat shown on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a next-to-window seat for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or the seat next to a window seat for half of the flight and an end of row seat for the other half of the flight. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up from their seats and move about the plane, allowing everyone to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow these amazing sights to be seen equally well from both sides of the plane. What happens if the weather is bad? We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain looks at the satellite cloud picture on the morning of the flight and selects the direction which promises the clearest views.

I was the slowest in the group, so I had to stop more often. The others sometimes waited for me, but when I reached them, they started again. I told myself that next time I would get ready for a climb. After 200 metres, we got to Tower Ridge. This path goes to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only one and a half metres wide, and the mountain goes down hundreds of metres on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and think about every step as we walked slowly along it. After seven hours, we reached the top. On a good day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. But we were not lucky because there was a lot of mist. On Ben Nevis, going back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You must know how to read a map. A wrong turn can take you to slopes that are too dangerous in winter. I was happy that we took turns to read the map. That first time, I only felt I really enjoyed the climb when I was safe in the tent. But I did get to the top."}

These early foot coverings were probably animal skins, which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on what is in fashion. It was only one hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories. The introduction of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce large quantities of cheaper shoes for a wider range of buyers.

In 2003, Tanya Streeter made history when she became the first person to dive 120 metres into the ocean while holding her breath, and come back up to the top without help. She had been deeper a year before but on that occasion she swam back up using a balloon. This time, however, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, which made her the only female in any sport to break the world record of a man. A team of fourteen safety divers at different depths watched the dive. Following reports of several serious accidents involving other divers, some people have complained that free-diving is too dangerous a sport, but Tanya doesn't agree, insisting that safety is the most important thing, followed closely by training. Most free-divers concentrate on one or two types of event within the sport, but whatever Tanya is in training for, her practice timetable remains the same. Two thirds of the programme is spent doing land-based training at the gym, with the rest divided between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to help improve the fitness of her heart. However, she doesn't run, whether outdoors or on running machines, because she doesn't want to injure her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is a very good way to build her fitness. When she starts doing practice dives, she generally travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over a four-week period, with a rest day between each diving day. It is essential that she doesn't get tired because that could ruin all the preparation. When Tanya is not preparing for an event, she makes frequent public appearances, mainly to advertise sports products. She has also supported environmental organisations, for example doing research projects or making films.

Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. This town grew so quickly during 1909 that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the summer months, essential supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat, but in the winter the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to them. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners. The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat for both themselves and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport. However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but, unfortunately, the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot considered skilled enough to manage the flight, was away on a trip at the time. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead. The trip covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska looking for gold, travelled the first 400 of those kilometres. He had to trust his dog Togo's ability to find his way in the blinding snow and Togo turned out to be a reliable guide.

In the summer, boats brought food and other things to the towns. But in winter, the water was ice. Boats could not come. So, in 1910, people made a winter path. Dog teams pulled sleds on this path. They took mail, food, and clothes to the people looking for gold. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. Later, people started using airplanes. They did not use the dog teams as much. But in 1925, the dogs were very important again. People in the city of Nome were very sick. They needed medicine. The medicine was in a city called Anchorage. It was very far away. The weather was too cold for airplanes. So, they used dog teams to bring the medicine. Many dog teams worked together. They ran over 1,000 kilometers. It took them only six days. One man, Leonhard Seppala, and his dog Togo, ran 400 kilometers. Another man, Gunnar Kaasen, and his dog Balto, finished the trip. Balto was a hero because he saved the team from danger. The medicine helped the sick people. Today, people remember this journey with a race. Every year, there is a dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome. It is called the Iditarod. People call it \"The Last Great Race on Earth.\""}

There he found the traditional drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting. In his late twenties he was given money by the Italian government to study art, and became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and wanted to put this light into his paintings. This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark, but he insists he's never sure what the results will be. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.' Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not do the painting afterwards. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.' Since moving to London years ago, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene.

This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival, an annual nine-day event. The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. There were about a dozen hot-air balloons and they took off from the car park in the middle of Albuquerque. From these small beginnings, the festival has grown steadily. This year at least a thousand balloons from over one third of the countries of the world are expected at its current out-of-town site. What to see The pilots are in radio contact with each other and all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. These are known as 'balloon glows' and are an opportunity to take fantastic photographs. However, you must arrive just after night has fallen or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around among the balloons and chat to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colours, some in the shapes of animals or cartoon characters and, of course, well-known products such as varieties of soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it. In the afternoon, why not take to the sky yourself by arranging a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering balloon rides? Another possibility is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest such ride anywhere, and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are plenty of other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and firework displays on the opening evening and the last three evenings of the festival. The Albuquerque Box This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds, and at the same time create gentler currents of wind at different heights.

You can write about whatever you want but here's some advice to start you thinking: Write about what you know This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends - these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way. Get your facts right It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it. Hold the reader's attention Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end. Think about the characters Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.

The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide as far as Alice Springs, but there was often serious flooding on the line making it difficult for trains to pass. A new line was completed a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph and the Ghan is certainly not a high- speed, inter-city train - there are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. Nor does the Ghan aim to provide luxury in the same way that a train like the Orient Express does, although the on-board food is excellent. The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. It is not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I could see that everyone was really looking forward to the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up the majority of my fellow travellers, were particularly keen to board. Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged nowadays and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset.

This was part of the plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide. But there was often a lot of water on the tracks, so trains could not pass. A new train line was finished just a few months before Mark's trip. The train can go up to 115 kph. The Ghan is not a very fast city train. It does not stop many times, and most people on the train are on holiday. The Ghan is also not a very fancy train like the Orient Express, but the food on the train is very good. The railway was first made to carry things to sell, not people. People thought it would be faster and cheaper to send things from Europe to the south of Australia by ship to Darwin and then by train, instead of by ship all the way around Australia. It is special to finish a railway across a continent. The Ghan says it is the world's first railway that goes from the north to the south. When Mark waited to get on the train, he saw that everyone was very excited for the trip. Many of the other passengers were older Australians, and they were especially happy to get on the train.

Imagine you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently braking. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think.

We collect news and write news reports, stories and articles. We send these to leading national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio and websites to be published. The news stories and articles by our members that are accepted by newspapers and TV and radio stations, can all be read or listened to on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three centres around the country where young people can meet other members and get involved in projects, and we intend to open new centres nationwide. Since our news agency started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says: 'I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I sat in a room with a team of young journalists and was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age wasn't important, they were trusted to do the stories on their own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen centre in my city, got some training, then was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen has helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With all the skills I learnt, I got a job at 19, and am currently the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles written by the journalists before putting them onto the site.' Get involved at every level When you join Eight-eighteen, you'll be trained and you'll take part in monthly meetings to decide who is going to be responsible for writing each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages skills-sharing between members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced Eight-eighteen members who are 12 years old and over. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they become more experienced as trainers, some members present sessions to audiences of young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips. Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year.

Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved enormously and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me and when she left, I was a bit sad. In fact, I called home late at night once to speak to her because I felt a little lonely.

It doesn't happen frequently and when it does, the city's water pipes can't manage the sudden floods, which turn the streets into rivers. But, as many winters have remained dry in recent times, when the rain does come, it is welcomed by the local people. Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist, not because of the rain, but thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. Basically dry places, which receive their water in this way, are known as oases. Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here every available piece of land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.

By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. In the winter of 1990 the French artist Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night a group of foreign guests decided it would be a good idea to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The following morning the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today it is world famous. As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed. As the ICEHOTEL is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season, the finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC, however cold it may be outside. Winter outer clothes such as warm overalls, hats and gloves are included in the cost of guests' stay at the hotel. In addition to this, it is a good idea for guests to bring sweaters and a scarf as well as plenty of woollen socks and to choose footwear that is larger than normal to allow space for thick socks. If you are planning to come to the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks and much more on the ICEHOTEL website.

It was really exciting seeing the builders clear the space where it would be, although it also meant that some lovely open land disappeared. And the noise of the building machines was really loud, although the builders often had to stop work because it rained so hard. We all began to think the building would never be finished.

Instead, the heat for the school comes from all of us inside it - the children, the teachers and the computers we use. The building is so well designed that it holds all the heat inside - and all the sound too, so if we sing inside our classrooms, we can almost believe we're inside a concert hall!

With two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has long been a popular centre for various religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and has recently celebrated its 900th anniversary, while Norwich itself had a year of celebration in 1994 to mark the 800th anniversary of the city receiving a Royal Charter. This allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself independently. Today, in comparison with places like London or Manchester, Norwich is quite small, with a population of around 150,000, but in the 16th century Norwich was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years and got richer and richer, becoming famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year. Nowadays, there are far fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964 the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. With its fast-growing student population and its success as a modern commercial centre (Norwich is the biggest centre for insurance services outside London), the city new has a wide choice of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and a number of arts and leisure centres. There is also a football team, whose colours are green and yellow. The team is known as 'The Canaries', though nobody can be sure why. Now the city's attractions include another important development, a modern shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. The people of Norwich lived with a very large hole in the middle of their city for over two years, as builders dug up the main car park. Lorries moved nearly a million tons of earth so that the roof of the Mall could become a city centre park, with attractive water pools and hundreds of trees.

I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. Now this book sends these ideas of mine out into the world, makes them public.

I spoke to Newman about their partnership while he was making one of his rare and unpredictable reunions with other members of the human race at a safari lodge. 'We do have occasional arguments but we tend to get over them fairly quickly,' he says of his colleague. Neither of them regard themselves as the leader, and he says that one of the reasons why they get on so well with each other is that they both see the animals in a similar way. 'When we are on the move, we have to put up our tents each night. But this time we are operating much more of a fixed camp, and as we set out at 5 a.m. each morning, we tend to make the tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask.' The rest of the Newman-Barrett daily diet consists of pre-packed meals heated and dished out by whoever is at hand at the time. 'It's not unusual for us to be out and about for up to eight weeks at a time, so catering does cause the odd panic,' says Newman. It can be", "target_text": "In their natural home Why do film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their homes for many months? They want to find the perfect scene to film. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the most difficult to find are producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater. It has rained almost every day for six months, and this has caused some problems. Newman said they had to buy expensive equipment. Now, if one of their cars gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull it out. He and Amanda work well together and have made some of television's best wildlife films, like their popular film about leopards. While people were watching that film, the two were already back in Africa. This time, they were filming another shy animal, the jackal. This is normal for television teams. Since television began, film-makers have travelled the world to film wild animals in other countries. I talked to Newman at a safari lodge, a place where he sometimes meets other people. He said about Amanda, \"We sometimes argue, but we forget about it quickly.\" He says neither of them is the boss. They work well together because they both think about the animals in the same way. \"When we travel, we put up our tents every night. But this time we are staying in a more permanent camp. We leave at 5 a.m. every morning, so we make our tea the night before and keep it hot in a special bottle.\" For food, they eat pre-made meals. The person who is nearby heats the food. Newman says, \"We often work away from home for eight weeks at a time, so finding food can sometimes be a problem.\" Their life can be difficult, but they like being alone in these faraway places. It lets them get close to the animals and feel like part of their lives. Newman remembers, \"Once we were filming a lion family. One female lion often went away by herself. When she came back, she would say hello to all the other lions. After some time, she started to greet our car too, as if it was part of the group.\" Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called 'The Great Rift'. Two years later, they started working"}

Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes.

A Grimson bag is not just for carrying things. It is also very beautiful. She uses the best leather or heavy silk. Her bags are special because they are both stylish and well-made. **Peter Little: Hairdresser** For more than 20 years, Peter Little has cut the hair of many famous people.

'People would do well to avoid the traditional, rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles,' he explains. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes. But you do not have to be a bride to own an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses, given a fresh touch by up-to-the-minute colours and fabrics. For the less adventurous, Ingham's designs include a classic summer navy-blue suit, the centrepiece of the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century.

Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it. A Jenny When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course. There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place. B Michaela It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself. If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears! C Lisa People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. Interviewing people has helped me realise that most - if not all - of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we speak to someone who's genuinely friendly. The best ever piece of advice came from my mother when I was agonising as a teenager about wearing the right clothes. She simply cried, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too busy worrying about how they look.' I've found that's well worth remembering.

It lives near rivers and eats fish. Old trees grow over the river. They make shade on the water. The colours are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sun. The sounds of the water are soft, too. Then the kingfisher flies by. It moves very fast and straight, like a light. It is gone in a second, but you remember it. Charlie loved kingfishers when he was young. He cannot say exactly why he loves this little bird so much. There are old stories about kingfishers. One Greek story says a moon goddess became a kingfisher. Another story says the kingfisher flew too near the sun. Its stomach got burned, and its back turned blue from the sky. This story has some truth. Kingfisher feathers are not really blue. The top feathers are made in a special way. They reflect light and look blue. When the light changes, the kingfisher can look bright blue or green. This is why wildlife photographers like them so much. Kingfishers do not like people, but you can watch them from a hiding place. This makes people love them for life. Charlie’s first hiding place was an old blanket over his head. He waited near the river. The kingfisher came back quickly and sat very near him. But it took four more years to get a good photo. By then, the kingfisher was the most important thing in his life. He spent all his free time by the river. But school took his time away from the birds. He missed lessons and did not do well in school. Still, people noticed his love for this bird. The European kingfisher is the only kind that lives in Europe. When he was 16, a nature magazine gave him a job. Later, he worked as an assistant for the magazine’s editor. Then he became a wildlife film cameraman. Now he wants to make the best kingfisher film. He says, \"No talking, just beautiful pictures. I like simple things. I like to take photos of kingfisher wings...\" He stops talking. He is thinking about the bird’s colours. He"}

We would have a weekly lunch. At the lunch, we would choose what to write about from the things Tom picked for us. There would also be guests to make it friendly. At that time, it all felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed impossible that a new paper could succeed when there were already so many. It seemed as unlikely as a millionaire wanting to help me and pretending to give me a job. I had so little confidence. In fact, the first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, and then turning to a page with one of my reviews, I felt very shy. Tom's first idea for a team of arts critics didn't work. It was a good idea, but we didn't meet as planned, so we did everything by phone. It also turned out that people liked to connect a reviewer with just one topic, so I chose film. But without Tom's first idea, we probably wouldn't have the system we have now, where I write one long article each week, usually about one film. This way of working is great for me. I wouldn't like the usual film critic's job, which means watching every new film. That routine would make me bored very quickly. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning, thinking, 'What bad film must I watch now?' - a thought you can often hear in film screening rooms everywhere. The space I get lets me write more about my ideas - or, on a boring week, it makes me try to write about nothing much"}

Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.

The relaxing methods help, but good dental care is the most important thing. For example, he uses a tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth. It feels strange at first, but it doesn't hurt if you are relaxed. Five years ago, Jerome went to the USA to learn about new dental methods. He says, \"When you make things easier for the patient, you make things easier for yourself.\" He thinks dentists in Britain should be less formal and more focused on patients.

They are always changing.\" Susan has always liked plants. \"I studied plants at school. I picked wild flowers from the countryside,\" she says. \"I didn't like garden flowers then. I thought they looked fake. I liked wild flowers because they grew in difficult places, like in rocks.\" Now, her garden has plants from other countries. They grow well in her garden. She is relaxed about the garden. She lets the plants grow freely. She has two art shows soon. It is hard to find time for the garden. She has another gardener now.

{"id": "141_B1", "input_text": "simplify to B1: An eye for detail Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, \"Oh, it's not worth it\" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.' Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.' Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.' Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says.

For many years, people ate a lot of soup and bread. This food was not good enough. People were often sick and small. In one study, people started to grow corn. Healthy people became sick and thin. They had more bad teeth and more sickness. Some experts say corn was bad for health. But farming spread because farms could feed more people. The problem was that people on farms were not healthy. Only rich countries have fixed this recently. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan do people now eat good food like long ago. Because of this, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall. In Holland, he is 180 cm, and in Japan, 177 cm. This is good, but it makes problems. People are taller, but the world is the same. Beds have been the same length for a long time. There is less leg space on planes and trains. Clothes companies must change their sizes. The question is: when will we stop growing? We cannot grow forever. There must be a tallest height. One expert thinks it could be 19"}

'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.' For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today. This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists. Nevertheless, from then on agriculture", "target_text": "It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. \"What do you want to be?\" the teacher asked. \"The flagpole on a ship?\" The teacher was joking because Chris, at only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe grows by one centimetre. Every year, more very tall people are born. This is interesting, but it doesn't mean humans are becoming a super race. In fact, we are becoming more like our cavemen ancestors. For many generations, people didn't eat well, but now we are starting to eat better. This is making a big difference. \"We are only now starting to reach our full potential,\" says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. \"We are becoming like the Cro-Magnon people who lived 40,000 years ago.\" For most of human history, our ancestors ate many different types of food. Women collected plants, fruits, and berries, while men sometimes hunted animals. Some tribes still live like this today. One study found that they ate 85 different wild plants.

In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sick and thin. They had more tooth problems and diseases. Some experts say corn was actually bad for public health. Still, farming spread because farmland could feed ten times more people than hunting and gathering. Even in rich countries, we only recently started to fix the problem of poor nutrition. Now, in Europe, the US, and Japan, people are eating a richer variety of foods again.

I can reach out and touch the two pilots.\" The pilots are used to these small spaces. They cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A trip can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down to the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water, and three hours to come back up. \"If there is a problem and you need to go up quickly, you can press a panic button,\" she explains. Then, a small round escape vehicle is released. It goes up to the surface very fast. \"No one has tried it yet, and I don't think it would be a nice journey.\" \"The first time I got into the vehicle, I was on a ship with an instructor. I didn't know how I would feel. The instructor told me what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot was ill. They were checking to see if I was okay in such a small space.\" Rachel has now made six dives. Last year, she went with a Russian team. \"We sailed for five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. On the ocean floor, there is a big area of underwater volcanoes. Black smoke comes out of them like chimneys. The Russian team left some scientific equipment there. They wanted to study the volcanoes by making a hole 150 metres deep in one of them.\" When she is not at sea, Rachel works in her office in Southampton. \"I get two thirds of my money from teaching, which I enjoy. But I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers'.\" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out very fast and is 350 degrees"}

But I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years when I was made redundant. It came out of the blue. I didn't get a particularly good pay-off but it was enough to set up the farm with.

'My painting began as a hobby but I realised I was getting far more excitement out of it than out of working. The decision to take redundancy and to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I talked to was very helpful. I think I was the first person who had ever told him, \"I don't want to go back to where I've been.\" He was astonished because the majority of people in their mid-forties need to get back to work immediately- they need the money. But we had married young and our children didn't need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We went to the north of England, where we didn't know a soul.

At worst, you may be in a different climate zone, thousands of miles from home and forced to wear wholly unsuitable clothes. Although airlines rarely reveal how many cases they lose, it is a fact of life that sooner or later regular travellers will be parted from their luggage. Even the best airlines slip up from time to time, and it is impossible for any carrier to guarantee that a passenger's checked luggage will go on the same flight, particularly when a journey calls for one or more changes of aircraft. The system works like this. Airlines insist on exaggerated check-in times (which require passengers to report to the airport at a given time before departure) designed to allow sufficient time for baggage to pass through the airport and be loaded on to the plane.

Then there is the possibility of human error, or an accident in which the destination label is torn off.

At Easter, British people spend over PS230 million on chocolate. A massive eight per cent of all chocolate is bought at this time. Only at Christmas do people eat more of the cocoa-based foodstuffs. Although the large-scale industrial production of chocolate began in the last century, the cacao plant was first cultivated by the Aztec, Toltec and Mayan civilisations of Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is an evergreen, tropical plant which is found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is melon-sized and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried they become cacao beans, which can be used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. This is a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans. The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also used them to make a drink called xocoatl. This is from the word in the Aztec language, Nahuatl, meaning 'bitter water'. In Aztec times the chocolate drink was flavoured with spices and used on ceremonial occasions and for welcoming visitors. The Spanish found the drink more palatable mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe did not spread to the rest of Europe for another century. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses were set up in Europe's capital cities, where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the chocolate drink was made from solid blocks of chocolate which had to be melted down in hot water. But in 1826, CJ van Houten of the Netherlands invented chocolate powder. This was made by extracting most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The age of the chocolate bar as we know it began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, combined cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to produce a solid block that you could eat.

He did this by taking out most of the fat from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847. A company in Bristol, called Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa fat, chocolate, and sugar to make a solid bar you could eat. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate. At first, French companies sold the most chocolate in Britain. An English company, Cadbury, even gave their factory in Birmingham a French-sounding name, Bournville, hoping it would seem more fashionable. But then, in 1905, Cadbury created their famous Dairy Milk bar. Clever advertisements said it was a healthy chocolate because it had lots of milk from the English countryside. This made it very popular, and it became a strong competitor to the French brands. Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each"}

They changed this land into the beautiful place you see now. To make the land not flat, workers moved a lot of soil and clay. Big machines helped, but people also worked very hard. After that, they brought in good soil to make the gardens, flowers, and rock areas. For the Model Village, people planted many trees and plants. They had to choose the right ones for this place. The plants must be strong because they are near the sea and the air has salt. They also must survive strong winter winds. Most plants came from nearby garden shops, but some came from far away, like Canada and New Zealand. Colin Sims thought of the whole village. He made all the models himself. There are more than 100 models. It took him nine years to make them, starting in 1972. He used different things to build them—stone, concrete, special wood, and plastic. This is so they can stay outside in all weather. At first, Colin asked experts for help to learn about materials. But soon, he learned how to do it himself. You will see that all the models are the same size and have many small details. This was done with a lot of patience and special ways of building. The Model Village is very popular.

I joined the chase and immediately fell over something or someone onto the floor. As I thought about how to catch Domino, I saw the snake. It had escaped. It was moving off the table and onto the floor. I bent down low as its large head and long, strong body came towards me. Now the snake and I were in the middle of a crazy scene. The cat with the mouse, the children, and the dog were all jumping and making noise. The snake was trying to bite, and the dog was barking loudly. The water in the kitchen was boiling over. I ran to turn off the stove, then returned to the room with new energy. This time, I caught Domino by the tail and pulled the wet, but not hurt, mouse from his mouth. By the way, that same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times but later died when it was old. Feeling good about catching the cat, I looked at the snake to see how to catch it. It looked very strong. Finally, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, moving slowly back and forth, but without any music. Slowly, the snake relaxed and put its head down on its body, but it still watched me carefully. Very slowly"}

In the early twentieth century, skating was stylish and reserved, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11- year-old Sonja Henie introduced a more athletic attitude which inspired a new wave of popularity. Nowadays art and athletics are combined and modern skating is both graceful and physically demanding. For the beginner, balance and control are all important and speed can only increase with proficiency. The position of your body plays a great part in balance. Legs slightly bowed and the knees bent keep the body weight centred; in effect the body leans slightly forward in this position. For skating, probably more than any other sport or recreation, relaxation is vital. For the starting position, the heels should almost be touching and the feet should be turned outwards. While pushing forward with the back foot, you make a very small movement with the other foot. Fairly easy, isn't it? If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. Knowing how to fall must be learnt among the skater's first skills. Even the best of the professionals fall. In order to fall without injury, you should be as relaxed as possible. In this way the shock of hitting the ice is lessened.

With proper guidance available at most of the ice rinks throughout the country, the basic figures can soon be learnt and the turns, jumps and spins of elementary free style will soon follow.

In some countries, rich people thought skating was an important skill to learn. In the 1900s, skating became very popular. A young girl named Sonja Henie skated in the Olympics and showed a new, sporty style. Today, skating is both beautiful and very athletic. If you are new to skating, you need to learn balance and control. You should not try to go fast at first. To keep your balance, bend your knees a little and lean forward slightly. It is very important to stay relaxed when you skate. To start, put your heels close together and point your feet out. Push with one foot and move the other foot forward a little. It is not too hard, right? When you can do this, you can make your movements bigger as you get better. All skaters fall, even experts. You must learn how to fall safely. Try to stay relaxed when you fall so it does not hurt as much. To stand up, go on your knees first, then use your hands to help you stand. When you feel good on the ice, you can try different types of skating. You can do figure skating, skate fast, or skate with a partner. It is best to learn figure skating first. Most ice rinks have teachers who can show you the basic moves. Soon you can learn turns and jumps. Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate like this, you should do exercises often. Before you skate, always warm up your legs, back, and shoulders. Pay special attention to your ankles and knees. After skating, do these exercises again so your body does not feel stiff. Skating is good for your health. It helps your balance and makes your body stronger. It is also good for your heart and lungs. If you also swim or run, skating can be part of a great plan to stay healthy and fit."}

For skating, it is very important to be relaxed. To start, put your heels close together and turn your feet outwards. Push forward with one foot while you move the other foot a little. It's quite easy, right? When you can do this, you can slowly make your movements longer as you improve. Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should learn. Even professional skaters fall. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This makes hitting the ice less painful. To get up, use your hands to go onto your knees, then stand. Once you can move on the ice with confidence, you can try different styles. These include figure skating, freestyle, speed skating, and skating with a partner. The best way to start is to learn figure skating first, then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basic moves. After that, you can learn turns, jumps, and spins. If you watch good skaters, you will see how relaxed and smooth they are. To skate like this, you should do regular exercises. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous. Before you skate, always warm up your legs, back, and shoulders. Pay special attention to your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises again to avoid feeling stiff. Skating helps your balance, coordination, and how you move. It makes your heart and lungs stronger and improves your overall fitness. If you also swim or jog, skating can be part of a great"}

The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced that they are just metres away from a five million dollar vein of gold. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to get a few more metres to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. Their search began after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town of the same name. While reading 19th century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the most promising area of land to study. Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. They then set about digging out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to form a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. Now they are running short of money. Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started turning the heads of the inhabitants as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful.

They have spent their lives looking for gold. They started after the father read about gold in an area called the 'Dolgellau gold belt'. They read old books and chose a place to look. First, they cleared the plants and found small pieces of gold in the rocks. For ten years, they got permission to work, took earth samples, and removed old cars and rubbish. Then they dug a tunnel and a deep hole. Now they do not have much money. They spent their savings. They need to find someone to give them £50,000 to dig a few more metres. Chris says, \"This looks difficult, but we can talk to some people.\" People in the town are talking about the dig. The idea of finding gold is exciting. Dolgellau needs tourists. People are hopeful but careful. A hotel manager said, \"If they are right, more people will come here. But I hope millions of people do not come and dig up the hillside.\" The Welsh gold industry is not big now. It was very big in the 1880s. One of the last mines closed a month ago.

The father and son team think their mine on a Welsh mountain might have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are only a few metres away from gold worth five million dollars. Terence, who is 68 and from Liverpool, said, \"As we dig, we are finding a lot of gold. Now we just need to go a few more metres to where there is even more.\" The two men have spent their lives looking for gold. They started their search after the father read about gold worth millions of pounds in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area near a Welsh town with the same name. They read old mining books and newspapers at the Welsh National Library and chose the best place to look. First, they cleared the plants and found small pieces of gold in the rocks. For the past ten years, they have asked for permission to work there, taken earth samples, and removed old cars and rubbish. Then they dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-metre deep hole. Now they are running out of money. They have spent all their savings and need to find someone to give £50,000 to the project. They need this money to dig a few more metres to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, \"Right now, this seems difficult, but we have many people we can ask.\" Last week, people in the area heard about the dig. The idea of finding gold is exciting for both the local people and the gold diggers. Dolgellau needs tourists, and people are carefully hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, \"If they are right, more people would come here. But if they find gold, I hope millions of people don't come and dig up the hillside.\" The Welsh gold industry is much smaller now than in the late 1880s. At that time, thousands of people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, at Clogau-St David's, closed a month ago. It made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales.

It can help you sleep better and feel less stressed. It can even help with some health problems. If you are still not sure, just remember: exercise is good for you. You can do many kinds of exercise. You can do aerobics, jog, or lift weights. But be careful. If you train too hard, you could get hurt. Start slowly. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor. Good posture is also very important. This is how you hold your body when you stand or sit. If your posture is bad, you might not look good and you might feel tired. To stand up straight, imagine a balloon is pulling the top of your head up. This helps you breathe better and makes your stomach look flatter. Stretching is important too. It makes your body more flexible. This helps you move easily and stops injuries. Try to stretch four or five times a week. Do the stretches slowly and carefully. So, a good exercise plan has a warm-up, some stretching, active exercise, and a cool-down."}

It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when all around you everything seems more and more unbalanced and the world becomes ever more fast and furious. Don't groan because this is yet another article about fitness. The reason why there are so many is that it is seriously good for you. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It improves muscle power and promotes good posture - the way in which you hold your body when sitting or standing. It helps prevent those muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It provides quick improvement in specific problem areas such as thighs, stomach and upper arms. It improves the condition of the heart and lungs and blood circulation. Probably all these reasons have been thrown at you time and time again, so maybe you are bored by them and have switched off. All right then, this should make you sit up and take notice. Did you know that exercise helps to ease depression and tiredness, and that it helps to regulate sleep patterns? Also that exercise is instrumental in controlling stress? Not only this, but exercise can help to relieve certain medical conditions. By now you should be influenced a little by these arguments. If not, common sense alone should tell you that exercise is good for you. There are plenty of types of exercise you can do aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, working out with free weights, working on weight machines. There is one point you should note - training too hard and with too much weight may cause injury, so start slowly and carefully. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. No amount of exercise will improve your body shape if you don't have good posture. This practically determines how you look and feel. Not only is a stiff or sagging body unattractive, it also lacks energy and is more likely to suffer from minor health complaints. If your body tends to slouch, imagine that the top of your head is connected to a helium balloon, which is trying to pull you up into the sky. This will help you to lift the chest for fuller and easier breathing. At the", "target_text": "Staying Healthy Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit.

It helps you have better posture, which means how you hold your body when you sit or stand. This can prevent injuries. It can also improve specific areas like your legs, stomach, and arms.

If not, just remember that common sense tells us exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, you should be careful. Training too hard or with heavy weights can cause injury, so start slowly. If you are not sure, ask your doctor what is best for you. Good posture is also very important for how you look and feel. A body that is stiff or slouching does not look good and can make you feel tired or cause small health problems. If you often slouch, try to imagine a balloon pulling the top of your head up. This will help you lift your chest to breathe better and make your body look slimmer. When you stand correctly, you should be able to see your feet. Stretching your muscles makes you more flexible and helps you move more easily. It also helps you keep good posture and prevents injuries.

That's what a National Trust Warden needs, according to Gareth Roberts. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're continually dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists and building firms.' Gareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he married. About 80 people applied for the post as National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience won him the job, despite his lack of formal training. 'I find it particularly helpful that I still farm with my parents and that I can deal with farmers on the same level and be aware of their problems. Also, they can't take me in about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he is well able to cope with the physical demands of the job - erecting fences, planting trees, building walls. Since he has been with the Trust, Gareth says he has come to understand more about nature conservation. 'When I was a youngster,' he recalls, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae and old birds' nests. And I thought to myself recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's really become clear to me that farming has affected the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' Gareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were set against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way.Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at the crossroads and there's just a small step needed to join them together,' says Gareth.

'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.' Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the opening ceremony. 'As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.' The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.' In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive.

Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she was having a normal day before next month's World Championships. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. \"Do people look at you strangely?\" I asked. \"I think only about my training - how I move my body and feet. I don't see other things. Sometimes I see cars slow down, but that's all,\" she said. \"My life now is about being my best for the Championships,\" says Kendra. \"I follow a strict plan to become very fit.\" This is her fourth World Championships and it will be the biggest one, with 27 countries playing. \"We will have home support, which is very special,\" she says. \"It's important that people in this country think better of netball. Because we are playing here, there will be more pressure than usual. People will expect us to play well and will support us more. They will want us to start the tournament with a good game.\" Their first game is against Barbados right after the opening ceremony. \"I think we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They are very good players.\" The England team is fourth in the world now. But Kendra says the World Championships will be difficult. \"You must try very hard every day. There are no breaks between games like in other competitions. In other tournaments you can lose the first game and still win. But this is different because you only have one chance and you must be ready.\" Kendra has played netball at the top level for fifteen years. The sport has become faster and more difficult. Players are stronger on court. \"We train so much because we want to win,\" says Kendra. \"But when the game finishes, we become different people. We are all friendly after the game.\" Netball now uses more science to test players' fitness. \"We all need to think and train like the best players in the world,\" says Kendra. \"As captain, I need to be strong in my mind and show others how to behave. My job is to help and support the team.\" \"My netball career has always been carefully planned from the start,\" she says. \"So I decided some"}
{"id": "175_B1", "input_text": "simplify to B1: Interview Tips First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words. Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.' Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verb", "target_text": "Interview Tips The first time you meet someone, they quickly form an opinion about you. In the first few minutes, people notice how you dress, if you look at them, how you move, and how you speak. They also listen to the words you use. Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, \"I worked hard for my degree. When I finished, I felt very sure of myself.\" She had an interview for a job at a local school. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. \"I wanted to change, but I knew I would be late, and I think it is important to be on time,\" she remembers. Mary did not get the job. Later, a friend who works at the school told her what the Head Teacher said: \"If a person does not try to look good for an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?\" Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says: \"People who look after their appearance often care more about their work. Many think that what is inside is most important, but in an interview, you should try to show your best side.\" But many people do not think a professional image is important. Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a large company. When her manager left, she applied for the job. She did not even get an interview. \"I thought it was wrong, so I asked the Personnel Director why,\" she says. \"He told me I did not look like a manager. He said I should wear better clothes before I try for a better job again. I was surprised. I do my job well, and my clothes should not matter.\" How you move and use your hands also affects the first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of the message about our feelings comes from our words. 38% comes from our voice, and 55% comes from our face. If your face shows something different from your words, people will believe your face. So, make sure your body language matches what you are saying. If they are different, the interviewer will be confused. It is also important not to seem too nervous to get the job or too keen to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a better job. Her interview went very well, and they offered her the job immediately. \"I was very happy,\" she remembers. \"But I"}

Yet, to me, there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother, also, always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a week, and so would my mother. Occasionally my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls but it is the letters I remember most. There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no", "target_text": "Write to me! In our busy world with phones and computers, people are writing fewer letters. But for me, getting a letter is very special. I love waiting for it, seeing who sent it, and reading what is inside. I have written letters all my life. It started when I wrote short notes to my mother. My mother always told me to write thank you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It was okay if the letters were short or messy. When I was 18, I moved to London to learn to be a doctor. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote to me. Sometimes my father wrote too. I loved his long, funny letters. Most letters from home talked about simple things my parents and their friends did. We also talked on the phone, but I remember the letters best. I also got letters from my boyfriends. When I was young, the people I liked often lived far away. We could only talk by writing letters. Writing letters made our relationships better. I found it easier to say what I felt in a letter than by speaking. I love getting letters inside birthday or Christmas cards. A short note is nice, but a long letter with lots of news is much better! I also love getting letters from other countries with nice stamps. I get letters from a friend in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Canada. I also write to a woman in France. We met in a restaurant on holiday. My husband took her photo, and I asked for her address. I am happy she wrote back. Now we write to each other often. I can practice my French with her. We have stayed at her house twice, and she has stayed with us. My best letter story happened this summer. My family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We wrote letters for 29 years but never met. People were surprised our friendship lasted so long. A local newspaper even wrote a story about us on the front page. I am happy my children also write letters. Like my mother, I tell them to write their own thank you letters. My daughter writes me little notes, just like I did for my mother. My daughter and son have their own penfriends in Texas. I really hope people do not stop writing letters. We should not let it become a thing of the past."}

I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in an awful mood and refuse to answer my questions. But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic and with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. Kira gives the impression of being slightly puzzled by her new-found fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should take part in the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. The achievement of being selected for the final [line 38: beginning] gave Kira the confidence to go through with it and [line 38: end] she performed perfectly.

She won a big model competition for Looks magazine. She was smiling and said sorry. Her mother was with her. Kira did not wear expensive clothes. She wore a simple black dress and trainers. She was not a selfish person. She was a friendly, tall, pretty girl. She said all models under 16 must have a grown-up with them for work. Her mother looked young and was very happy for her daughter. Kira feels a little surprised about being famous. She did not plan it. Her older sister saw the model competition. Her sister said Kira should try it.

ANNE MANSON When Anne Manson, 30, asked if she could attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna, she found herself standing in for an absent assistant. She was then asked to help on another opera the next season. 'I had to take the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I always had a good attitude to standing up in front of an orchestra.' American-born Manson works with a well established London-based opera company which concentrates on modern works. She is also building a reputation in other European countries, which she has visited with financial aid from the British Arts Council, and, since that first occasion, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects. B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE The most difficult part of being a conductor is deciding how to convince people to present you with the right opportunities; saysAndrew Constantine, 31, who won a major competition in 1991, after failed attempts in two other contests. Looking back, he is grateful for the timing: 'If it had happened any earlier, I am sure I would have disappeared without trace: The competition provided many performance opportunities and a period as assistant to a well-known conductor, but Constantine is finding it difficult to lose the 'competition' label: 'If in three years' time my name is still associated with the competition then I will be worried,' he says.'But orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra who took me on after the competition are now inviting me back. If this doesn't happen,your career will gradually fall to pieces.' C. WASFI KANI Wasfi Kani, who set up Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice period which is part of any opera production. 'The music is worth four weeks' attention; says Kani, who started conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she supported herself by working in London's commercial centre until Pimlico Opera turned fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was the key moment for her.

The next season, she was asked to help with another opera. 'I had to lead the first practice for Abbado. I was not nervous. I have always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra.' Manson is American and works with a famous London opera company that performs modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries. She has visited them with money from the British Arts Council. Since that first time, she has helped Abbado on several more projects. **B. Andrew Constantine** 'The hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right chances to work,' says Andrew Constantine, who is 31. He won an important competition in 1991 after not winning two others. He is happy he won when he did. 'If I had won earlier, I think I would not be successful now.' The competition gave him many chances to perform and to be an assistant to a famous conductor. But Constantine finds it hard that people still remember him for the competition. 'If people still connect my name to the competition in three years, I will be worried,' he says. 'But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are now asking me to come back. If this stops happening, your career will fail.' **C. Wasfi Kani** Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She loves the long practice time that is part of making an opera. 'The music is good, so it is worth four weeks of work,' says Kani. She began conducting seriously when she was almost 30. After university, she worked in London's business area to make money. Pimlico Opera became a full professional company two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was very important for her. 'I watched her conduct and saw she was the same size as me. My other teachers were much bigger, and that is very different.' She likes that opera is complicated. 'There are many disagreements, and you must think about the singers'"}

Readers of this magazine often write in saying, 'I have written this story / book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should be researching their markets and finding out about publishers as well as practising their writing skills. Turning words into a saleable commodity takes a good deal of knowledge about the 'writing game'. Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. There are several ways of doing this, but the best one is simply by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time. As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated as new publications are constantly appearing - editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always hungry for new blood; as writers we have to make sure we give them what they want. To begin with you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let us say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The very first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, taking special note of who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in catering to their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never actively discourage anyone.

You should learn about the places where you want to publish your work. The best way to do this is to read a lot. Go to your local library, bookshops, and newsagents.

Publishers always want new writers, so we must give them what they want. Maybe you are not sure what you want to write. For example, maybe you want to write short love stories. First, find magazines that print love stories. Then, read many of these magazines. Learn what kind of stories they buy and who reads them. The editor wants stories for their readers. Sometimes writers send me their stories and say, \"No one wants my story. Am I wasting my time?\" I always try to be positive. But often, the writing is not ready to be published. I try to give an honest but helpful answer. Many new writers send their work out too soon. If you have only written one story, it probably will not be published. This almost never happens. When you read about a \"new\" successful writer, you often find they have been writing for years. When you send your work out, do not wait for an answer. Start writing more stories right away. Write ten more, or even twenty. Each story will be better. You will feel more like a writer, and you will become more confident. Do not throw your stories away. Make them better instead. Also, in the beginning, it is better not to show your work to other people. Remember, all good writers had many \"no\" answers before they got a \"yes\". Do things to help your writing.

Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago, we've established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box -- a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her. I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours. Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented.

The mother was found deceased, with her cubs still attempting to nurse. The cubs appeared healthy but were cold and whimpering. After treating them for fleas, I brought them into the farmhouse kitchen and positioned them near the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. Initially, I fed them using a syringe, but first I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic their mother's grooming. This stimulation encouraged them to relieve themselves. For the initial days, they required feeding every four hours. Within a week, the cubs had progressed to bottle feeding and were moving around, albeit unsteadily. With each other for companionship and a heated pad serving as a substitute mother, they seemed quite content. However, three weeks after their arrival, I observed that Willow appeared lethargic, despite eating normally. This was a warning sign I should have addressed immediately. Unfortunately, I failed to recognize the seriousness, and I discovered him dead the following morning. A post-mortem examination revealed that Willow had succumbed to a lung infection. When bottle-feeding young animals, it's crucial to prevent them from drinking too rapidly, as liquid can enter the lungs."}

Before machines were used in factories, blacksmiths were as important as doctors. They were the only ones who made weapons, armour, and tools for farming. They were also seen as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths made beautiful iron designs for St Paul's Cathedral. The curved metal in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was always made by a skilled blacksmith. But by the late 1960s, there were almost no blacksmiths left in Britain. Big factories did not need them, and architects building tall blocks of flats did not use nice iron things like handrails. However, in the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become a bit more popular again. This is because people are more interested in decorative buildings and home design. Still, a lot of the work you see is not very original. Companies that make gates and balconies often call them 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. In many modern design shops, you see the same old rusty candlesticks. Luckily, there are other choices. Over the next few weeks, some events will try to show people the skill of blacksmithing.

People think they are not like other clothes. But these clothes are made in big numbers. The store looks nice, and that helps them sell. E. How Much Money People think about all the money they spend on food. Stores sell some cheap things and some expensive things. Not everything is cheap. Sometimes stores sell things for very little money to get people to come. F. The Price When you buy only a few things, you look at the price. A price of $14.99 looks better than $15.00. This small difference is important. G. The Lights Stores think about the lights. Clothes stores use lights like the sun. This shows you the true color of the clothes. Food stores use special lights to make food look good. H. The Floor Many stores use different floors. One floor shows you where to walk. Another floor shows you where the things to buy are. People usually walk on the path. One store uses wood for the path. This makes people walk onto the carpet where the things for sale are. I. Pictures in the Store When you go into a food store, you see big pictures of nice food. This makes you hungry. In America, some stores have shopping carts with a screen.

Less to Sell More** Some clothes shops show only a few of each item. This makes the clothes seem special. But these clothes are often made in big factories, like other shops.

They often put fruit and vegetables near the entrance, or even plants for sale, to create this feeling. They may also have a bakery inside the store, so the smell of fresh bread spreads through the air. The colours used in the shop can also help this image – for example, green is often used because it reminds people of fresh food.

Product placement Where products are placed in a shop is very important for sales. This is especially true in supermarkets. Using computers to track products, supermarkets can find the areas where customers shop most often. They put products with the highest prices or those that sell very fast in these spots. In shops, the shelves at eye level are the most valuable. Manufacturers want their products there, or the shop may use them for their own brand. Special offer baskets attract customers who love a good deal. Another popular method is 'complementation' – for example, putting desserts near the ice cream, or salad dressings near foods like burgers. C. Spreading basic items around Supermarkets often place basic, low-price items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This means customers have to walk past more expensive, tempting products to find them. Similarly, chain stores put the products they are famous for far from the door. They know customers will look for these items, and on the way, they might see and want other things. D. Less stock sells more Chain stores have changed how they show their products in recent years.

They show only a few items on display, making the clothes seem special and exclusive. In reality, Next's clothes are made in large numbers, just like their competitors'.

The theatre director Because of my bizarre personal life, which I cannot be proud of, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about. I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become a friend rather than a father. I don't believe in physical violence. I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me. As soon as you start chasing them to ask why they have not been in touch, you impose this terrible burden of guilt. My parents did it to me and I would never do it to my children. B. The advertising executive I was young when they were born, only around 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite irksome. It aged me quickly, but at the same time it kept me young, which is something I have always valued. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I could have drifted away from: music, youth culture, clothes. In a funny way that has been invaluable as far as running the agency has been concerned. I have never felt out of touch. Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France. They get on well with a lot of our friends and they come to parties with us and advertising awards ceremonies without feeling intimidated. I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting. C.

I do not like hitting. Sometimes I was angry and I hit my children. But I do not think it is good. I know I was not a perfect father, but I was always there. They can call me if they need me. I never ask them why they don't call. My parents did that to me. It made me feel bad. I will never do that to my children. **B. The advertising executive** I was young when my children were born. I was about 25. It was difficult to have so much to do. It made me feel older, but it also kept me young. I like that. When they became teenagers, they showed me new music and new clothes. This helped me with my job. I always knew about new things. When they were young, I was very busy with my work. I missed some important days, like their first concerts. I am sad about that. But now I can do nice things with them. We can go on holiday to the south of France. They are friends with our friends. They come to our parties and to my work events. They are not shy. I think it is good that my job is fun for them. **C. The politician** My first child was born when I started my job in politics. Then I had more children very fast.

The aye-aye uses its front teeth to bite into the wood and a very long, thin finger to find and pull out the insects. People knew about this way of eating more than one hundred years ago, but scientists have only just learned how the aye-aye finds the insects inside the wood. A scientist named Dr. Carl Erickson studied how aye-ayes hunt. He worked with a few aye-ayes that live in a special center. First, he wanted to know if they used their eyes to find insects. For example, maybe they looked for small holes on the wood where insects go in. He gave them logs with small holes that he made. Some holes led to food, but others did not. The aye-ayes always went to the holes with food. They did not need to see holes on the surface. Next, the scientist thought maybe the aye-ayes used smell or sound. But more tests showed they did not need these clues either. They could find food even when they could not smell it, and they could find dead insects that made no sound. So how did they find the insects? Dr. Erickson saw that they sometimes bit into wood even when there was no food inside. They seemed to know there was a hollow space there. When an aye-aye looks for food, it taps on the wood with its long middle finger. It also moves its very big ears forward to listen carefully. The scientist thinks the aye-aye is listening to the sound of the tap. If the wood is hollow underneath, the sound is different. It might also hear insects moving when it taps.

Dr Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those", "target_text": "In the forests of Madagascar, there is a rare primate called the aye-aye. Its way of life is very similar to a woodpecker's. Both animals search for insect larvae by making holes in wood and checking spaces inside. The woodpecker uses its beak to break into the wood and its long tongue to catch insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its front teeth to chew through wood and its long, thin third finger to find and pull out the insects. Although scientists first described this unusual feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how the aye-aye finds insects hidden inside the wood. Dr Carl Erickson from Duke University’s Primate Center studied the hunting skills of several aye-ayes. He first wanted to know if they found insects just by looking for signs on the surface, such as small holes. He gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes that he had made. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, chewing through the wood without needing to see any surface clues. Next, Dr Erickson tested whether the aye-ayes used smell or sound to find the insects. But even when the smell was blocked, or the mealworms were dead and silent, the aye-ayes still found them. So how did they do it? Dr Erickson noticed that they also chewed into empty spaces. It seemed they could sense the hollow areas inside the wood. When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and moves its large ears forward, pointing them in front of its nose. Dr Erickson believes the aye-aye is using a kind of echolocation—listening and perhaps feeling for vibrations that show there is a hollow space below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping. Some scientists think the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar, where there are no woodpeckers. However, there are other birds there that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker’s role may not be empty. The a"}

{"id": "204_A2", "input_text": "simplify to A2: Life was getting out of hand Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and rediscovers the joys of manual labour. Everyone is in love with technology. It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK. These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment. However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor - a PS48 call-out fee, a labour charge of PS15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires. This makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us. So when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost. I am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go. Of course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight.

Graham develops individual designs that are customized according to his clients' specific needs. \"In this way, I can create a unique, personalized item,\" he explains. \"Many of my customers are women purchasing gifts for their husbands.

A. THE BRAIN SURGEON Name: Anne Age: 34 ANNE'S DAY \"I get up at 6.30am, go the gym at 7am, get to work by 8am and start operating at 8.30am. I operate all Monday and Wednesday, as well as some Friday afternoons. Most standard head operations take three hours, but some operations take all day. I've worked ten hours straight through on occasion without eating or going to the loo. Deciding when to operate, and what to do, can be stressful. I don't feel particularly stressed when operating, but sometimes I worry about what I'm going to do the next day. Brain surgery tends to be a last resort for a patient, but when it works it's tremendous, and more than makes up for the unsuccessful times.

In that time, we have not changed very much. Our genes are still more than 98% the same as a chimpanzee's. This means that the things that make us different from animals happened very recently. Our bodies and brains are almost the same. So, the ability to make art and other things that seem special to humans must come from only a very small number of our genes. This is a big job for just a few genes. It is not surprising, then, that scientists who study animals are finding that many things we thought only humans could do are also done by animals. Now, most of the differences between us and animals are just a matter of how much we do them, not if we can do them. For example, humans are not the only ones who use tools. Wild chimpanzees use sticks to eat and fight. Sea otters use rocks to break open clams. Monkeys have a simple language with different calls for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These discoveries mean there are very few things that are completely different between us and animals, except for art.

After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. Mr Spassky is even older. Chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. A new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game.

Fischer's win in the first game was a brilliant performance. However, the games that followed showed he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, has not practiced recently, and is not in good physical shape. Spassky is even older. Chess has changed a lot in the last twenty years. Fischer's own popularity helped make the game more professional. Today, the competitive side of chess is more important than the artistic side. For modern chess masters, the only goal is to win. In international chess, a player's mental strength and physical energy are as important as their intelligence. The pressure has always been high because of chess clocks.

This extra pressure gives an advantage to younger players. For the past thirty years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. It is important to note that eight of the world's top ten players are under 30 years old. The way players prepare for games has also changed. A lot of modern chess happens away from the board. Every professional player must prepare carefully before a match. This is especially true now because of computer databases.

It seems to make life harder, not easier. Darwin had an idea. He thought female birds like the beautiful tails. He called this \"sexual selection.\" But his friend Wallace did not agree. He said the beautiful tail shows the male bird is healthy and strong. Now, scientists at Whipsnade are studying the peacocks. They want to know two things. First, do the female birds choose the males with the best tails? Second, are those males better in other ways? The scientists watch the birds. They see that the females like the males with the most spots on their tails. These males find more mates. But are these males stronger or healthier? Another scientist thinks birds with nice feathers have fewer sicknesses. The scientists at Whipsnade are checking this. They are also looking at the baby birds. They want to see if the babies of the popular males grow faster and stay healthy. There is one more idea. A scientist named Fisher said that if females like long tails, the tails will get longer over time. The males with the longest tails will have more babies. The females will like long tails even more. This could be why peacocks have such amazing tails. In this way, the females really are choosing beauty because they like it."}

This brings up a question that interested Charles Darwin: in a world where animals compete to survive, why would birds develop something that seems unnecessary? How does this help them? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find an answer. Darwin believed that animals change over time through a process called evolution. He said that in nature, the animals best suited to their environment are the ones most likely to survive and have babies. This is called natural selection. However, a peacock’s tail doesn’t seem useful for survival. In fact, it might even make life harder for the bird. Darwin thought that females might choose males based on their looks alone. He called this idea \"sexual selection.\" But Darwin’s friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if female birds prefer males with impressive tails, it must be because those males have other good qualities that help them survive. The tail is like an advertisement for a healthy and strong bird. Today, scientists are still trying to understand this. At Whipsnade, the peacocks live freely but are used to people, so they are easier to study. Marion Petrie’s team is asking two main questions: Do female birds really choose males with the most beautiful tails? And do those males have other qualities that make them better partners? After watching the birds for a long time, researchers found that females do prefer males with more eye-spots on their tails. But are these males actually healthier or stronger? Some scientists think that bright feathers might mean the bird has fewer parasites or diseases. Dr. Petrie is now studying the baby birds of attractive and less attractive males to see if the babies of the attractive ones grow faster or are healthier. There is another interesting idea called \"Fisher’s Runaway.\" It suggests that if females start preferring longer tails, this preference can grow over time. Males with longer tails will have more babies, and females will continue to prefer longer tails. This could eventually lead to very large and beautiful tails, just like the peacock’s.

This behavior presents a question that troubled Charles Darwin: in a competitive natural world, how could such a showy and impractical feature evolve? How do these birds survive with it? Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are now studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, over a century after Darwin's death, to find an answer. Darwin believed that living things evolved through natural selection. This means that in a competitive environment, the individuals best adapted to their surroundings are the most likely to survive and reproduce. However, this idea suggests that the \"fittest\" should be the strongest, fastest, or smartest. A peacock's tail seems like a waste of energy and a disadvantage. Because of this, Darwin proposed a second evolutionary process called 'sexual selection.' He thought that females chose males simply because they found them beautiful. Darwin's colleague, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be a practical reason. He thought the tail was like an advertisement, showing that the male had other good qualities that helped survival. Today, the debate continues.

First, do peahens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? Second, do those males have other useful qualities, as Wallace thought, or is it just about appearance, as Darwin suggested? Observations show that the males display together in certain areas, and the females compare them. Research confirms that females are indeed attracted to the males with the most \"eye\" patterns on their tails. The males with the most eye-spots get the most mates. But are these males also better in other ways? One theory is that a showy appearance signals that a bird is healthy and free from parasites. There is evidence for this in other bird species.

{"id": "215_B1", "input_text": "simplify to B1: Ancient Chinese medicine in the West? Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Some GPs, midwives and physios use it regularly for pain relief. A. What's it all about? Traditional Chinese medicine sees health as a state in which the energy of the mind, body and spirit are in harmony. According to the theory, energy or Qi (pronounced chee) flows around the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each linked to an internal organ, and lots of tiny meridians take Qi to every cell. When the flow of Oi is upset, blocked or weakened, the body is said to be out of balance: weakness or illness may result. During a consultation with a traditional acupuncturist, he or she will try to find where imbalances occur in the Qi. This is done by feeling pulses on your wrist, examining your tongue and assessing your general appearance. He or she will ask about your medical history, current health, general well-being, state of mind, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin. He or she may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians, to stimulate the flow of Qi. B. Over three hundred points The points used for acupuncture are related to meridians so won't necessarily be near the site of the complaint. People often say they feel a not unpleasant dull ache or tingling sensation when the needle is gently manipulated. This is either done by hand or by attaching the needle to an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this sensation shows the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often. C. Science tells us how Without accepting the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, doctors here have accepted that acupuncture can work for pain relief. This is because they have been able to provide scientific explanations of how it might work. For example", "target_text": "**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West?** Acupuncture is 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also uses herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. It can treat many problems, but in the West, doctors are most interested in how it helps with pain. Some family doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it often to help people feel less pain. **A. What is it?** Traditional Chinese medicine believes you are healthy when the energy of your mind, body, and spirit are in balance. This energy is called Qi (sounds like \"chee\"). It moves through your body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ inside your body. Many small meridians carry Qi to all your cells. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, your body is out of balance, and you may feel sick or weak. When you see an acupuncturist, they will check where your Qi is not balanced. They do this by feeling the pulse in your wrist, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, lifestyle, and how you feel. Then, they put very thin needles into your skin at certain points. Sometimes they also use warmth from herbs or pressure to help the Qi flow better. **B. Over 300 points** The points where the needles go are on the meridians. They are not always near the part of your body that hurts. When the needle is moved, people often feel a dull ache or a tingling feeling. This feeling means the needle has reached the Qi. There are more than 300 points on the main meridians, and many more that are used less often. **C. Science explains how it works** Many Western doctors agree that acupuncture can help with pain, even if they do not believe in the idea of Qi. Science can explain why it might work. For example: * It may stop pain signals from going to your brain. * It may help your body make its own natural pain-relieving chemicals. **D. What kind of pain can it treat?** Many people try acupuncture when other treatments for long-term pain do not work. It is often used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, migraines, and pain after an operation. Acupuncturists"}

He quickly gets involved in dangerous politics, secrets in the church, and murder. We always feel sure that he will be safe and find the criminals. The story is complicated and a little too long, but it is still a very good book. **BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new and interesting detective from a first-time writer, Sarah Lacey. The detective, Leah Hunter, works for the tax office. When a strange man dies right in front of her, she is in a good position to investigate. People attack her from different places, but she is not afraid. The local police officer, who is good-looking, does not want her to help, but she doesn't listen. Brave and capable Leah is a great character. **BOOK D** In *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker, the private detective Spenser is a very intelligent man. His job this time is to help his friend Hawk. They must stop drug dealers in a poor part of Boston. The characters talk in a very clever and fast way. There is some shooting, but not many people die. The book also has more thoughtful ideas than usual. It is high-quality fun, which is normal for this writer. **BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has her usual detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They are investigating a violent attack and a robbery at the home of a famous film star's"}

In 1968, the winter in New Zealand had a lot of rain. It rained almost every day we planted. It seems funny now, but it was a very happy time. I was often wet and cold for a long time. Every morning was difficult. I got out of the car, which was warm and dry. The rain was falling. My coat was still wet from the day before. My boots were wet. My hands had trouble with the wet shoe laces. In the first year, a man worked with me. He knew how to plant trees. This helped me a lot. You wear a bag around your neck and fill it with trees. When the bag is full, it is very heavy. It gets better when the bag becomes lighter. The hardest part was making the lines of trees straight. You decide how far apart to put the trees. You use poles to make a long, straight line. Then you plant along that line. I like hard work, and this made me strong. After a while, you can plant trees without thinking too much. You find a rhythm. You use your spade to make a hole. You take a tree from the bag, put it in the hole, push the earth down, and move to the next spot. Your mind is free to think about other things. I started to think a lot about nature and people. These thoughts became very important in my life later."}

He spoke with Danny Danziger. There was a strange period in my life when I didn't experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer here, which is winter there, so I experienced nine consecutive winters. I really appreciated this because I enjoy winter weather. My parents came up with the idea of purchasing a small piece of land that my brother, sister and I could manage. My mother told us, 'If you're willing to invest the time and effort to plant trees here, then you can have it.' The intention was for us to maintain a permanent connection to New Zealand, which was meaningful since my father had been raised there. They located a plot approximately 20 miles north of Auckland in an area called Rangitoupuni. The soil quality isn't particularly good, but it's adequate for growing trees. I've always had a strong interest in land and nature. Having spent a year in Australia working on sheep stations and various farming jobs, the prospect of planting trees appealed to me immediately, and I became enthusiastic about the project. I believe my family grew more interested as we progressed. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had successfully planted all 70 acres. The winter of 1968 in New Zealand was particularly challenging. It rained excessively, almost continuously, and it seems somewhat strange to recall it as such a joyful period since it rained during most of our planting days. I doubt I've ever been more wet or cold for such an extended duration. Each morning presented a moment of truth: preparing for the day's planting. Emerging from the relatively warm, dry Land Rover into the falling rain, putting on a damp coat from the previous day, pulling on soaked boots, and struggling with slippery shoelaces. During that initial year, I worked alongside an experienced tree-planter, which proved invaluable since I had no previous serious planting experience. You wear a planting bag around your neck filled with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it's quite challenging, and only as it becomes lighter does the work feel more manageable. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the entire process was maintaining straight planting lines. You determine the appropriate spacing between trees, then align three poles across"}

He went to a training camp in Kenya. The camp is high up in the mountains. The camp is near Mount Kenya. It is a beautiful but quiet place. Richard has trained there before. But he never trained with Kenyan runners in Kenya. On his last trip, he did two new things. He ran his first race in Kenya. The air is thin there. He also stayed at the training camp for Kenya's best runners. They get ready for big races there. The coach invited him after a race. Richard thought it was a great chance. Training high up helps your body. It makes more red blood cells. This helps you use oxygen better. Kenyan runners are very successful. This training is one reason why. His first race in Africa was also the first big international cross-country race held there. Many runners were faster than him. Almost all of them were from Kenya. Richard felt he ran well, but it was not easy. He thinks Kenyan runners are successful for more reasons than just the altitude. They have a simple way of running and living. They eat simple food and are relaxed. They also really love to run and compete. Richard wanted to know how they train. He found out when he stayed at their camp. The camp is at a school on Mount Kenya. It is a simple place. The runners live in dormitories with six people in a room. Every day, they do three runs: an easy run in the morning, a harder run later, and another run in the afternoon. They start at six o'clock. The coach told them to take it easy. They ran about 40 kilometres every day. That is almost a marathon. On Sunday, they only ran 20 kilometres. This was a nice break. Life was simple. They washed their face and brushed their teeth. For breakfast, they had tea, bread, and eggs. For lunch and dinner, they ate ugali (a maize food), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they drove to a stream to bathe. When Richard left, he understood Kenyan success better. It is not just because of where they live or their families. He thought about a different reason. Maybe the secret is their simple"}

This makes us ask: \"What is normal?\" After all, everyone has small strange habits. Maybe someone loves entering competitions in newspapers, or feels they must collect beer mats, or often writes angry letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is a way to show we are all different. Inside most of us, there are two strong feelings that fight each other. One feeling is the wish to be our own person. The other is the wish to be like others and fit in. For most people, the wish to fit in is stronger. We want to be accepted, liked, and to feel we belong with other people. This is often stronger than the wish to be different and do things our own way. For example, people with unusual hobbies or strong ideas often meet each other. They start clubs, have meetings, and organize events. There, they can talk about their shared interests. The important idea is 'shared'. They look for other people who like the same things, which their family and friends might think are strange. Being in a group, even a small one, makes them feel better. Most of us feel this fight inside between being an individual and fitting in. Even when we are following the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We sometimes feel we must show we are different. For example, an angry man in a bar might say, \"I always say what I think.\" Or a new person you meet might tell you, \"You have to accept me as I am.\" We can always change this. We can choose to be more individual and show our own personality. Many successful people have done this. One example is the American singer Bob Dylan. He once said that if you really believe in what you are doing and you keep trying, you will confuse many people. But trying hard to show you are different is not the same as being a true eccentric. If a pop star wears very strange clothes just to get attention, or a famous woman says shocking things to be in the newspapers, that is not eccentricity. However, if they keep doing these things until it becomes a real part of who they are, and they can no longer act in a 'normal' way, then they become eccentrics. The most important part of eccentricity is that it is natural."}

Many people have made it to the top in their", "target_text": "ECCENTRICS An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual, someone who does not follow the usual rules of their society. This makes us ask, \"What is normal?\" After all, most people have their own small strange habits. It could be a strong interest in entering newspaper contests, a need to collect beer mats, or a habit of writing angry letters to newspapers about many topics. Eccentricity is a way of showing we are unique individuals. Inside most of us, there is a constant struggle between two forces. It is as if we have two trains facing each other on the same track, pushing against one another. One is called individualism and the other is called conformity. For most people, the force of conformity is stronger. The wish to be accepted, loved, and to feel part of a group is stronger than the wish to be different, to be independent, or to do things our own way. For example, notice how people with unusual hobbies, strong views, or different behavior often come together. They create clubs, have meetings, and organize events where they can meet and talk about their shared interests or problems. The key word is 'shared'. They look for other people who they can share their interest with—an interest that family, friends, and neighbors usually find strange. Being in a group, even a small one, makes them feel more secure. Most of us probably feel this inner tension between being an individual and fitting in. Even though we often follow the crowd, we don't like to admit it. We feel a need to show we are unique. For example, an angry man in a bar might tell the people near him, \"I always say what I think.\" Or a cautious new acquaintance might say, \"You have to accept me as I am. I'm not formal.\" Any of us can change this at any time. We can choose to be more individual and express our own personality. Many successful people in their jobs have done exactly that. One example is the American singer Bob Dylan, who once said that when you truly believe in what you are doing and you keep going without giving up, you will confuse many people. But this deliberate effort to show you are different is not true eccentricity, at least not at first. If a pop singer wears very strange clothes just to get attention, or a famous hostess says shocking things about her guests to"}

A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these. A. GROUPING PEOPLE Avoid straight lines in group shots. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels. Otherwise, have some of the group sitting or kneeling at the front so that you can see all the faces, or raise your own viewpoint. B. POSING FOR PICTURES People seldom act naturally in front of the camera. Often they stiffen up and the pose becomes rather wooden. Relax your subject by helping him to find a comfortable position. You might suggest he folds his hands or puts them in his pockets. C. THE RIGHT APPROACH Never try to pretend that you are not taking a picture of someone when it is clear that you are as this only creates tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to have their picture taken - perhaps after some initial protestations - and are quite flattered by it. But they are likely to become rather self-conscious and you may need to direct them. A picture can be spoiled by the fact that the subject is looking rather aimlessly out of the picture so that the interest lies elsewhere. D.

Ask your subject to look into the lens - not necessarily to smile as well -- and this is the effect you will get. The subject may not be able to do this for too long: he may become self-conscious or be distracted by someone nearby. So remind him once more, just before you release the shutter. Or try saying something funny or unexpected as you take the shot for a genuine reaction rather than a meaningless stare. E.

The person should be the main thing in the photo. H. People Together When two or more people are talking, working, or playing, it is a good time for a photo. Look for people looking at each other or touching, like holding hands. Wait for them to laugh or talk to get a good photo. I. People and Places We often take photos of people on holiday.

Harriet is a confident, middle-class woman with a husband who is an architect and her own company. Under normal circumstances, she would never have met Sheila, a working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and raised her grandson, Leo, from a young age. Their lives are turned upside down when Leo, a teenager, violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the trial, both boys refuse to discuss the incident. Leo, who had always been a good student and never been in a fight, won't say why he did it. Joe heals from his injuries but becomes quiet and distant. Harriet is deeply troubled by the effect on her son and looking after him becomes her main focus. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet—and from this meeting, an unexpected friendship develops. The author is excellent at showing how people deal with major life changes. He also perfectly captures a mother's feeling that, no matter what she does, it is never enough. C. This book, which was a finalist for the Booker prize, tells the story of a very remote Scottish Orkney island and its people over a long and quiet history. The story is connected to important events in Scottish history, which are vividly pictured in the daydreams of the young main character, Throfinn Ragnarson. Throfinn suddenly disappears partway through the book and only returns after the Second World War, having learned to value the simple lives of his hard-working ancestors. D. After his recent major success, the author has written a follow-up that is filled with the same gentle humor and sharp comments about family life that made the first book so popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearly seventy and lives"}

Amanda's story I'd never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first! By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I'd remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated. After a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say 'Pardon?', which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realised how tiring waitressing would be.

First, I had to learn to carry a drink tray with one hand. The other waitresses did it easily. But when I tried, the drinks fell on the floor. I felt silly, but the other waitresses just laughed.

It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first! By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I'd remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated. After a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say 'Pardon?', which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day!

We asked five major British publishers whether reviews influence a book's commercial success. Here are their responses. Publisher A Reviews are extremely important for publishers – they are the first section of the newspaper we read. According to a past Book Marketing Council study, when people were asked why they bought a particular book, more mentioned reviews than any other influence, such as advertising or recommendations from friends. Authors and publishers react differently to reviews. Both are disappointed if a book receives no reviews, but publishers are generally more accepting of negative ones. They believe that any publicity is valuable, and that a combination of very negative and very positive reviews can create interest, encouraging readers to form their own opinions. Publishers are most satisfied when a reviewer's opinion of a book matches their own. They are often the first people to read it. Publisher B Publishers and the press clearly share an interest in book reviews, but their goals are different. A newspaper or magazine aims to provide its readers with engaging content, while a publisher wants its books to be reviewed, and ideally, praised. Book reviewing has definitely improved over the last 40 years; it is now more diverse and less elitist. However, a common complaint remains that paperbacks, which are the most widely read format, are often ignored. Weekly review sections are not really sufficient, even when they are well done. Still, publishers should not complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews. Reviews are a cost-effective method for making a book and its author known. There is no doubt that an enthusiastic review from a trusted source can increase sales, especially if there are several of them. A book's fame is what ultimately leads people to read it. Publisher C Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would lose a vital resource. Since we usually publish books by authors who are not famous, and because we rarely advertise, we rely on literary editors to feature our books. When reviews are positive, they are far more valuable than any advertisement. Readers understand that a good review is an independent opinion, not influenced by the publisher's marketing. There is no question that this helps to sell books. Publishers themselves often admit they prefer a long review, regardless of its content. The actual impact of reviews on sales is the great mystery of the business. Positive reviews can launch a book"}

We went to four contrasting offices, to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist, who studies people's working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. Here are their verdicts. Office A. Advertising Agency Building Health Consultant: This office is about as simple as it could possibly be; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows opening straight onto the street. It is difficult to see why this space works but the occupants who are part of a small, dynamic team, appear to have few complaints. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators -- pretty much, perhaps, as they do in their own homes. This may be the key: a team of seven people have crated a happy, homely working environment and do not have to put up with any externally imposed bureaucracy. Ergonomist: The furniture here has evolved; no two pieces match. Much of it actually creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable and many are broken. Although in that way this environment is poor, the personnel have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, out meeting clients, making presentations, and so on. This variety reduces the risk of fatigue, boredom and muscular problems. Occupational Psychologist: Staff are delighted with the variety of work and the versatility of the office space. They said their office was 'just the right size' -- small enough to know what colleagues are doing, large enough to be able to be on your own and focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, simultaneously conveying images of efficiency and creativity. Office B. News Service Building Health Consultant: While the office may not be very exciting, it appears comfortable and is not disliked by the staff. The air quality and general maintenance standards appear to be good. This is helped by a No Smoking policy.

Here is what they said. **Office A: Advertising Company** Building Health Expert: This office is very simple. There is no central heating. The windows open to the street. It is a small, busy team. The workers are happy. They open doors and windows when it is hot. They turn on heaters when it is cold. They work like they are at home. This is a happy office. Work Expert: The furniture is old. The chairs are old and broken. They are not good for sitting. But the workers do different things. They work in the office, meet clients, and give talks. This is good. They do not get bored or tired. Work Psychologist: The workers like their jobs and their office. The office is not too big and not too small. They can work alone or with others.

A new study says fresh air and good chairs help workers be happy and healthy. We went to four different offices to see how good they are for people. We asked three experts: a building expert, a work expert, and a people expert. Here is what they said. **Office A: Advertising Agency** Building Expert: This office is very simple. It has no central heating. The windows open to the street. It is hard to understand why it is good, but the small team is happy. They change things with the seasons, like opening doors or using heaters, like at home. This might be why it works: the seven people made a nice, home-like office. Work Expert: The furniture is all different. Most of it is not good for sitting well. The chairs are old, many are broken, and you cannot change them. But the people do different kinds of work — in the office, with clients, giving talks. This change helps them not get tired. People Expert: The workers like the different jobs and the office space. They said the office is a good size — small enough to know your coworkers, but big enough to work alone. I thought the office was nice and fun. It looked good for work and new ideas. **Office B: News Service** Building Expert: This office is not exciting, but it is comfortable and the workers like it. The air is good and the office is clean. This is because no one can smoke inside. Work Expert: The company asked a work expert before. The chairs are very good. The lights and computers are good too. There is enough space, but the way it is set up could be better. The office feels a bit boring, with grey walls. People Expert: The walls have almost nothing on them. Most workers have been there for over five years and are friends. The office could be better if the desks were closer so people can talk more. They could put news about their work on the walls. **Office C: Bank** Building Expert: People in this office have different feelings about it. Inside, it feels like you are in a glass box, and you see other people in boxes too. Some people smoke and some do not, but the air felt okay. Even standing near a smoker, you could not smell the smoke. Work Expert: This office is very normal and not interesting. The desks"}

We went to four contrasting offices, to find out how healthy and happy they were as working environments. On our expert panel were a building health consultant; an ergonomist, who studies people's working conditions; and an occupational psychologist. Here are their verdicts. Office A. Advertising Agency Building Health Consultant: This office is about as simple as it could possibly be; no central heating, no mechanical ventilation, windows opening straight onto the street. It is difficult to see why this space works but the occupants who are part of a small, dynamic team, appear to have few complaints. They adapt to the changing seasons by opening doors and roof panels or switching on electric radiators -- pretty much, perhaps, as they do in their own homes. This may be the key: a team of seven people have crated a happy, homely working environment and do not have to put up with any externally imposed bureaucracy. Ergonomist: The furniture here has evolved; no two pieces match. Much of it actually creates bad working postures. Chairs are old, most aren't adjustable and many are broken. Although in that way this environment is poor, the personnel have a varied work schedule, which they control -- office work, out meeting clients, making presentations, and so on.

Here is what they thought. **Office A: Advertising Agency** **Building Health Expert:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no special air system. The windows open to the street. It is hard to understand why this place works well, but the small, busy team seems happy.

Most of it is not good for your posture. The chairs are old, many cannot be adjusted, and some are broken. Even though the furniture is bad, the people have different kinds of work that they control – like office tasks, meeting clients, and giving talks.

They said the office is 'just the right size' – small enough to know what your coworkers are doing, but big enough to be alone and focus. I thought the office was nice and fun. It felt both efficient and creative. **Office B: News Service** **Building Health Expert:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it.

The chairs are excellent. The lighting and computer equipment are good. There is enough space, but the arrangement could be better. The environment is not personal or interesting, with plain grey walls. **Psychologist:** The walls are mostly empty, except for some calendars and a poster.

In this account, she describes how she managed to turn her family home into a productive workplace. Two Christmases ago, I celebrated my 37th birthday and understood that time was limited if I wanted to revive my career in journalism – a career I believed had been destroyed by advancing technology. A quick review of my CV revealed that my skills were embarrassingly outdated, rooted in the 1980s when typewriters represented the latest technology. It seemed unlikely that any employer would trust me to use a computer in a modern newsroom. Furthermore, I noticed that most job advertisements required desktop publishing experience, which I completely lacked. I felt I would have an easier time leading a seminar on nuclear physics than attempting to design a page on a computer. Within my family, I was known as the technophobe; even basic calculators confused me, and I still had no idea how to program the video recorder. It was clear that my career prospects were limited, and I needed to take immediate action. I assumed that leaving home for work before my children went to school would present numerous challenges. My perspective changed when I entered a competition organized by a local newspaper. Much like those success stories you hear about that never happen to you, my family unexpectedly won a complete computer system.

Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances. Handwriting analysis is increasingly being used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs. But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions. She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.' According to Ms Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.

It can also help us understand their mental ability, if they are better at arts or sciences, and if they are honest or like to hide things.\" According to Ms Marne, graphology is especially helpful in finding people who might commit crimes. \"Criminals often have messy, hard-to-read handwriting. Many come from poor families and have emotional problems. This can be seen in handwriting that looks very young or when people write over letters again and again.\" She adds, \"Young men who break the law often make some letters very tall.

{"id": "240_A2", "input_text": "simplify to A2: Hedgehogs A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world, none is native to either America or Australia. All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked, so that their spines point outwards. The effectiveness of this as a defence mechanism, depends, of course, on the number of spines the hedgehog has.

This is especially true for young people taking a year off, who usually do not have special skills.

Still, these projects might help volunteers become better people who care about others in the future. B. Volunteering can help people understand other countries better. It can help them solve problems, join global groups, and make friends around the world. In this way, everyone benefits—both the volunteers and the communities they help. But if only rich people from wealthy countries can volunteer, they get the advantages, like a better career. The poor communities do not get the same chances. The volunteers may use the experience just to help themselves. C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be like a selfish holiday for rich Westerners. Other times, it is real help for development. At its best, it helps both the volunteer and the community. Volunteers can share skills and learn about other cultures. Most importantly, volunteering can make people aware of unfairness and poverty, and they may decide to fight it for their whole lives. D. Volunteer tourism seems like a good way to help others. It feels positive because it is personal—not through government or big companies. But it also avoids real government action and makes helping others just about small acts of charity.

In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, while some types of magazines lost readers, many others grew quickly. You can see something similar with books. E-readers like the Kindle are becoming very popular, and sales have grown a lot this year. The first step of the transition seems clear. But when booksellers checked the value of the physical books they sold in the last six months, they found it was only 0.4% lower. So, screen or paper? It wasn’t one or the other—it was both. Stories about young people no longer reading newspapers are often exaggerated. If you look at the latest National Readership Survey, you will find that almost 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main national daily papers. Even within Europe, different countries have different situations. In Britain, sales have fallen by 10.8% in recent years, and quality papers have lost 19.6%. But in Germany, the overall drop is only 7%,"}

This ability to find water or other things underground is sometimes called a 'sixth sense'. There are different ideas about how it works. Some think it is related to magnetism, while others believe it is more spiritual. One reasonable explanation is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials.

A Geoffrey Lean It was easy to choose the writer. As a journalist who writes about the environment, I have lived a long time and met some of the great people who first had important ideas in this area. The most important person I met was a small, quiet woman named Barbara Ward. I believe no one else understood environmental problems in Europe after the war better than she did. She put her knowledge from different environmental groups into her own strong way of thinking. When I was a young journalist and had to write about this topic, her ideas helped me understand everything. Choosing the book was more difficult. I could have chosen Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But for me, her most important book is The Home of Man. The book is mainly about the fast growth of cities around the world, but it also talks about the big ideas she cared about all her life. It is a very powerful and emotional argument for what we now call 'sustainable human development'. I have read hundreds of other books, but I have never found one as good as this. B Linda Bennett When I open the book Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the sounds of herring gulls, remember the smell of bird waste in the hot sun, and see the busy activity of the bird group in my mind. This book uses words and pictures to explain the interesting world of how animals talk to each other. If you read this book and then watch a group of gulls, you will understand their busy actions. It changes from looking like chaos to a very organised social group. You can see which birds are a pair, where their area is, and later you can recognise whole families. Niko Tinbergen was a famous scientist who studied animal behaviour. He was the kind of expert who wanted normal people to understand his work. He worked with a great wildlife artist, Eric Ennion, on this book. Ennion's way of painting came from many years of watching and understanding birds. With only a few lines and a little colour, he can show one gull being aggressive and another being peaceful. This is the skill of a true nature expert.

The museum also has a special area for children. A group of children helped plan it. They wanted to ride through the museum, but they got a hands-on center instead. Because of this, the top floor has the only temporary exhibition. It has different objects that Scottish people chose as important for life in Scotland. The Prime Minister chose an electric guitar. Others chose televisions and toys. The idea is fun, but it does not feel very serious. It might be better when the computers with people's stories are working.

Out of the blue, Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden, has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today. His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers of the baroque and classical periods, but new works too. When you meet him, bright-eyed and good-looking, he seems even younger than his years, as fresh and open in his manner as the sound of the trumpet. Recently in one of London's premier concert halls he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, something of a party-piece for him, while on television a whole feature was devoted to his work and development, filmed both here and in Sweden. Born near Malmo, he owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight. His father, unmusical but liking Louis Armstrong's playing, had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. Being a serious man, he didn't pick a toy trumpet, but took advice and bought a genuine grown-up instrument. The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, whom she persuaded to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson was an up-and-coming musician, and at once spotted natural talent. Hardenberger consistently blesses his luck to have got such a teacher right from the start, one who was himself so obsessed with the trumpet and trumpet-playing that he would search out and contact players all over the world, and as a 'trumpet fanatic' was 'always looking for another mouthpiece'. There the mature Hardenberger has to draw a line between himself and his teacher.

Besides, you can't find two mouthpieces", "target_text": "A trumpet is not just for Christmas. Many musicians do not come from musical families. Hakan Hardenberger is one of them. He is the only son of parents who are not musical. They live in the countryside in the south of Sweden. Now, at 30 years old, he is a very special trumpet player in the world. His music recordings help people find new songs. This includes old music and new music. When you meet him, he has bright eyes and is good-looking. He seems young for his age and is very friendly. Not long ago, he played a famous trumpet song in a big London concert hall. He was also on television in a show about his life and work. The show was filmed in London and in Sweden. He was born near a city called Malmo. He started playing music because of a Christmas present when he was eight years old. His father does not play music but likes the musician Louis Armstrong. He decided to buy his son a real trumpet, not a toy one. The boy loved the gift straight away. He played the trumpet all the time. His mother found the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra. This man, Bo Nilsson, said yes to teaching her son. Bo Nilsson was a good musician. He quickly saw that the boy was very good at playing. Hardenberger feels very lucky to have such a good teacher from the start. His teacher loved the trumpet very much and was always looking for new parts for it. Hardenberger thinks about the trumpet in a different way from his teacher. He says the trumpet is a simple instrument and it is not perfect. You cannot make a perfect trumpet. He says the important thing is to learn about the small problems with the instrument and work with them. From the start, Hardenberger was good at this. He says that even when he was a boy, people could hear his special sound. It was the first thing he learned. He always thought of himself as a solo artist, not an orchestra player. When he was a boy, his hero was a French trumpet player named Maurice Andre, who also played alone. The boy bought all of his records. His parents helped him.

He plays this piece very often. Also, a TV programme was made about his life and work, with filming in both London and Sweden. He was born near Malmo.

Bo Nilsson was a young musician and quickly saw that Hakan had a natural talent. Hakan feels very lucky to have had such a teacher from the beginning. His teacher loved the trumpet so much that he was always looking for new mouthpieces and contacting players around the world. But Hakan has a different view from his teacher. He explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument and no trumpet is perfect. He thinks it is important to learn about the instrument's small problems and get used to them. From the start, Hakan was good at finding the right balance. He says that even as a boy, he had his own special sound. This was the first thing he learned to do. Unlike some other great players, like the British trumpeter John Wallace, who played in bands and orchestras, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. As a boy, his hero was the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also did not play in an orchestra. Hakan bought all his records and admired him greatly.

It's remarkable how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without any musical background. A perfect example is Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents with no musical interest from southern Sweden. Now, at the age of 30, he has established himself as one of the world's most exceptional trumpet players. His recordings consistently introduce audiences to new repertoire. This includes concertos by long-forgotten composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as contemporary works. When you meet him, he appears younger than he is, with a fresh and open personality that matches the clear sound of his trumpet. He recently performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, a familiar piece for him, in a major London concert hall. Meanwhile, a television documentary focused entirely on his career and development, filmed in both the UK and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began accidentally with a Christmas present at the age of eight. His father, who wasn't musical but admired Louis Armstrong, decided to buy his son a proper trumpet rather than a toy. The present was an immediate success. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet player of the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, and persuaded him to give her son lessons. Nilsson was a promising young musician who instantly recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger considers himself fortunate to have had such a dedicated teacher from the very beginning. Nilsson was so passionate about the trumpet that he constantly searched for new equipment and contacted players worldwide. However, Hardenberger holds a different opinion from his teacher regarding the instrument. He explains that the trumpet is a fundamentally simple instrument that will always have slight imperfections. For him, the key is to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them. From the start, Hardenberger demonstrated a natural ability to find the right balance. He notes that even as a child, his distinctive sound was already developing, which he describes as the first significant skill he acquired. Unlike other leading players, such as the British trumpeter John Wallace who developed through orchestra work, Hardenberger has always considered himself purely a soloist. As a boy, his role model was the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who was also known as "}

It focuses instead on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness - the 'people skills' that make up what is now commonly referred to as emotional intelligence. B In a time when few guarantees of job security have led to the very concept of a 'job' being rapidly replaced by 'portable skills', personal qualities begin to play an important role in the workplace. Talked about loosely for decades under a variety of names, from 'character' and 'personality' to 'soft skills', there is, at last, a more precise understanding of these human talents as well as a new name tor them. 'Emotional intelligence' is generally defined as the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. In our work-life it comprises basic elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships. There is a common assumption that it simply means 'being nice', However, at strategic moments it may demand not 'being nice', but rather, for example, bluntly confronting someone with the uncomfortable truth. Nor does emotional intelligence mean giving free rein to feelings - 'letting it all hang out'. Rather,", "target_text": "Emotional Intelligence – The Key to Success Daniel Goleman looks at the 'people skills' that are necessary to reach the top of your career. A The rules for work are changing. We are now being judged by a new standard. It is not just about how intelligent we are, or our qualifications and knowledge, but also about how we manage ourselves and work with others. This standard is now often used to decide who gets a job and who does not, who is promoted and who is not. The new rules can show who is likely to be a top performer and who is more likely to be average. No matter what job we do now, these rules measure the qualities that are important for our future employment. These rules have almost nothing to do with what we were taught was important in school. Being good at exams is not very important for this new standard. The new measure assumes that we all have enough intelligence and technical skill to do our jobs. Instead, it focuses on social abilities and personal qualities, such as taking the first step and understanding others, being flexible and good at persuading people – the 'people skills' that together are now usually called emotional intelligence. B Because few jobs are secure for life, the idea of a 'job' is quickly being replaced by 'skills you can take with you'. As a result, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. People have talked about these qualities for many years using different names, from 'character' and 'personality' to 'soft skills'. Now, we finally have a clearer understanding of these human abilities and a new name for them. 'Emotional intelligence' is usually described as the ability to recognise and control your own feelings and the feelings of others, and to use feelings to help you think and act. At work, it includes key parts: knowing yourself, self-control, motivation, empathy and skill in relationships. Some people think it just means 'being nice'. However, sometimes it might require not being nice, but instead, for example, telling someone a difficult truth directly. Emotional intelligence also does not mean letting all your feelings out without control. It means handling feelings so that you express them in a suitable and effective way, helping people to work together well to reach their shared goals.

The film looks very impressive, but the story is quite simple. **B - The Thin Red Line** This film is about a famous battle from a book. Another director also made a film about this story. This version is more simple and direct. It follows one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. The other film is more artistic, but this one also has some very good scenes. **C - On Guard** This is a fun adventure film with sword fights. It is based on an old story. The villain is a clever politician who plans bad things. The hero is full of energy. The film uses some old-fashioned ideas, but it is so fun to watch that you don't mind. **D - Character** This is a serious story that takes place in Rotterdam a long time ago. The clothes and buildings look very old and detailed. The main character is a cruel man who hurts people. He has a very bad relationship with his son. The film looks beautiful, but the story is not very powerful. **E - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly** This is a famous old film that now looks and sounds much better. You can hear every small sound very clearly. The story is exciting and sometimes violent. The music is wonderful. It is hard to say who is good or bad, because the three main men all do bad things. **F - The Longest Day** This is a very long war film with many famous actors. It shows the story of a very important battle. The film has too many characters and stories, so it can be slow and confusing. It is a film that is much better to watch in a cinema. On a television, it is not as exciting."}

It is about workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep under the sea. The main workers, like Bud and his team, are brave and talk in a funny way. The film looks amazing, with great sets and effects. But the story and the characters are not very deep. It feels like a simple action movie. **B – The Thin Red Line** This film is based on a book about a famous battle. There is a newer film about the same story, but this older one is more like a normal war movie. It follows one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. The new film is more artistic, but this one has some good scenes. For example, when the soldier dreams of his wife, it feels very real and emotional. **C – On Guard** This fun adventure film is based on an old book. It is better than many other films about sword fights. The villain is a clever politician who plans bad things in secret. The hero is full of energy, but he is not in the film for very long. Another actor plays a serious man who used to be an acrobat. The story uses some old ideas, but it is so enjoyable that you don’t mind. **D – Character** This film is set in Rotterdam around 1900. It is a serious story with beautiful costumes and sets, but it sometimes feels like a museum. The main character is a cruel man who throws people out of their homes. His difficult relationship with his son is the main part of the story. But the film focuses too much on the historical details and not enough on the dark story. **E – The Good, the Bad and the Ugly** This film has been improved for video. The director’s work looks and sounds great. You can hear every small sound clearly. The story is very tough, and the music makes it even more exciting. The three main characters—the good, the bad, and the ugly—are all selfish as they travel across America after the Civil War. It is hard to tell who is really good. **F – The Longest Day** This war film is three hours"}

It follows oil rig workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stuck deep underwater. The conversations and brave humour of the foreman, Bud, and his team remind us of similar quiet heroes in Howard Hawks’ movies. The production design and special effects are very impressive. However, the dialogue and characters feel weak. Despite the high-quality filmmaking, the story itself is quite simple and typical of a B-movie. **B - The Thin Red Line** This video version of James Jones’ novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is an interesting contrast to Terrence Malick’s newer film. Malick’s film is poetic and thoughtful, while Marton’s is a more traditional war movie, although it often follows the book more closely. Marton focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. Malick’s film is deeper and more complex, but Marton’s version also has strong moments. For example, the scene where the soldier dreams of his wife is shown with a harsh realism that may be more effective than Malick’s softer, dreamy style. **C - On Guard** Loosely based on Paul Féval’s 1875 novel, this old-fashioned but very entertaining adventure film is better than most similar stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a convincing villain—a cold politician who plans violence from behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is quite short. Daniel Auteuil may seem too serious for this kind of fun film, but he also has good moments as an acrobat who becomes a swordsman. The movie uses familiar costume-drama ideas, but it does so with so much energy and cleverness that it doesn’t feel like a problem. **D - Character** This is a good-looking but gloomy story set in Rotterdam around 1900.

{"id": "260_B1", "input_text": "simplify to B1: Hit and miss of mass marketing AS ALMOST everyone knows, advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite. Advertising's problems are more fundamental, and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change. Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are. That is the principal way in which advertising has gone astray. Think about your own shopping habits. If you visit a supermarket you may leave with 30, 40 or perhaps 50 items listed on your check-out bill, the average number of items of all kinds purchased per visit of all kinds. Many of these will not be advertised brands; some others will be multiple purchases of the same brand. At a maximum you will have bought a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands. Consumer durables? Perhaps a dozen a year. Cars? If yours is a new car, the statistical likelihood is that it is supplied by your employer. If it isn't, you only buy one every three years. And though it may seem otherwise, you do not buy that many clothes either, and most of them will not be advertised brands. Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. Compare that figure with the 32,500 branded goods and services that, according to Media Register, are advertised. Let's ignore the 23,000 which spend less than PS50,000 a year, and concentrate on the 9,500 brands that Media Register Individually lists and analyses. Mr and Mrs Average have bought 400 of that 9,500, and not all because of their advertising. That's about 4 per cent. So you can forget that naive claim usually attributed to Lord Leverhulme: 'Half of my advertising is wasted but I've no way of knowing which half.' You could say that 96 per cent of all advertising is wasted, but nobody knows", "target_text": "The hit and miss of mass marketing As most people know, advertising is not doing well. It's not just because of the economic problems. Advertising started to go down in early 1989, before the economy got really bad. The problems with advertising are more serious, and this is happening all over the world. The simple truth is that advertising has not changed as fast as the economy has. Advertisers like to think about big markets and big media, but now there are many more brands and types of media. This means markets are split into smaller groups. Even ads for big brands should be made for smaller groups of people, but usually they are not. This is the main way advertising has gone wrong. Think about how you shop. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or 50 things. This is about average for most people. Many of these things will not be advertised brands. You might buy some of the same brands more than once. At most, you will buy a few advertised brands from the 15,000 different products in the store. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. What about bigger items like washing machines? Maybe about twelve a year. Cars? If you have a new car, it might be from your job. If not, you probably buy one every three years. You don't buy many clothes either, and most clothes are not advertised brands. Even if you include sweets, medicines, tools, and services, you probably don't buy more than 400 different brands in a year. Now compare that to the 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 that spend very little money, we can look at the 9,500 main brands. An average person buys 400 of those 9,500 brands, and not all because of ads. That's about 4%. So the old saying, \"Half of my advertising is wasted, but I don't know which half,\" is not right. You could say 96% of advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96%. When you watch TV tonight, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. For most people, it's about 1 in 16 ads (6%). So the other 15 ads (94%) seem to be wasted. You might think you are special and that ads don't affect you. Almost everyone thinks this.

The Old English Pearmain was a sweet apple people ate. The Costard was an apple used for cooking. It was sold in markets for a long time. But then, times became hard. There was little rain, a bad sickness, and wars. People grew fewer apples and bought more from other countries. This changed when King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn about apples. The man came back with new apple trees and started the first big apple farm in Kent. **Apples travel the world 1750** By the 1600s, apples were very popular in Britain. When people sailed to new countries like Canada, Australia, and America, they took apple seeds with them. These seeds were very important to them. A famous man in America, Johnny Appleseed, planted apple trees in many places. People told stories about him because he was very kind and loved apple trees. **The Delicious apple 1850** Around this time, a farmer in Iowa named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing.

He returned with new apple trees and created the first modern orchard in Kent. **Apples Travel the World (around 1750)** By the 17th century, apples were very popular in Britain. When the first settlers sailed to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apple seeds with them as valuable possessions. Famous explorers like Captain Bligh brought apples to Australia. In North America, the most famous apple planter was Johnny Appleseed. He planted apple trees across a large area, and many stories were told about his unusual life and kindness. **The 'Delicious' Apple (around 1850)** Around this time"}
{"id": "261_B2", "input_text": "simplify to B2: A history of the apple Apples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size. But the late twentieth century is in danger of squandering its heritage. Prehistoric wilding 8,000 BC Human beings have been munching apples since prehistoric times. They spat out apple-pips in neolithic Britain. And 10,000 years ago they left apple remains to carbonise around their Swiss and Italian lakeside homes. In Switzerland and in the regions adjoining the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even appear to have dry-stored apple-halves for winter. But these were wild crab apples, tiny wizened fruit which, in Ancient Britain came to be known as 'windings'. They had little in common with the apples we know today. Norman knowledge 1000 AD From the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended. Mediaeval favourites 1200 Several kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word 'costermonger' - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street. But prosperity declined as the country was hit by successive droughts, the Black Death and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced and more were imported. This went on until the sixteenth century when Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with a 'great store of grafts' including the famous Pippins, from which he grew the first ever modern-style orchard at Tey", "target_text": "A History of the Apple Apples have existed since the earliest recorded history, appearing in countless colours, shapes, and sizes. However, by the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage. **Prehistoric Wild Apples – 8,000 BC** Humans have consumed apples since prehistoric times. In ancient Britain, people discarded apple seeds, and 10,000 years ago, apple remains were left to carbonise near lakeside homes in Switzerland and Italy. In these regions, early humans even dried and stored apple halves for winter. However, these were small, wild crab apples, which were very different from the apples we know today. **The Norman Influence – 1000 AD** The French acquired advanced fruit-growing skills from the Romans, which were later refined in monasteries. This expertise, including cider-making, was introduced to Britain during Roman times, along with dessert apples like the Decio. However, most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate, so Norman types became dominant. British monks continued to experiment, and most Western apples today are descended from these varieties. **Medieval Favourites – 1200** Several apple varieties became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and named for its pear-like shape, remained the primary dessert apple until the eighteenth century. Its cooking equivalent was the Costard, which was sold in Oxford markets for centuries and is the origin of the word \"costermonger.\" Apple production declined due to repeated droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to increased imports. This situation continued until the sixteenth century, when Henry VIII sent his chief fruiterer to France to study apple cultivation. He returned with many new varieties, including Pippins, and established the first modern-style orchard in Kent. **Settlers Spread Apples – 1750** By the seventeenth century, apples were so highly valued in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the United States, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh introduced apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers to America. In North America, the most famous apple planter was John Chapman, known as \"Johnny Appleseed.\" Born in 1774, he planted apple nurse"}

{"id": "264_B2", "input_text": "simplify to B2: Online Literary Criticism For All Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun? From the outset, the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice, however, a certain amount of technical know-how was required, at least in the early years. However, there was at least one field, previously restricted to the few, that was genuinely opened up to the masses. By visiting the pages of Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, anyone was able to try their hand at literary criticism. Amazon's egalitarian approach to book reviews -- namely, that anyone could say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars - looked, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and whenever a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically. This meant that Amazon got to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers of a book could see what other readers thought of it, for better or worse, rather than reading just the blurb from the publisher and the views of professional critics. Other online bookstores which also operated as large bricks-and-mortar bookshop chains provided similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted by far the greatest number of reviews and, accordingly, encountered the most funny business. For this critical free-for-all lent itself to subversion of various subtle and not-so-subtle kinds. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day - Amazon would not say exactly how many - so it was impractical to vet them all. Instead, a team of editors scoured the site, checking that reviews conformed to the company's guidelines. Single-word reviews, for instance, or personal attacks on the author, were not allowed. Nor were reviews that contained obscenities, gave away the ending, or referred to other reviews. Ultimately, however, the reviewers were anonymous (they were not required to give their real names) and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon checkers noticed them. So there was plenty of scope for mischief. For example, there was nothing to stop writers giving their own books", "target_text": "Online Literary Criticism For Everyone Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just entertainment? From the beginning, the Internet was designed to be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their writing or share music online. However, in the early days, you needed some technical skill to do this. But one area that really became open to ordinary people was literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing a book review. Amazon's system for reviews was very democratic: anyone could share their opinion and give a book a rating out of five stars. At first, this seemed like a perfect idea. Every book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a review, it appeared there immediately. This meant Amazon got free content for its website. It also meant that people thinking about buying a book could see what other readers thought, not just the publisher's description or professional reviews. Other online bookstores that were part of large physical chains had similar features. But Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of online sales. Because it had the most customers, it received the most reviews and also had the most unusual problems. This open system was open to misuse. Thousands of reviews were posted every day—Amazon wouldn't say exactly how many—so it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors looked through the site to make sure reviews followed the company's rules. For example, reviews with just one word, personal attacks on the author, bad language, spoilers, or comments about other reviews were not allowed. However, reviewers were anonymous and didn't have to use their real names. Problematic reviews were only taken down if Amazon's team found them. This meant there was a lot of opportunity for people to cause trouble. For instance, authors could write very positive reviews for their own books. Author Lev Grossman was so upset by the bad reviews for his first novel that he posted several anonymous positive ones to improve its rating. His plan worked until he wrote an article admitting what he had done. The fake reviews were then quickly removed. Authors did have a special way to comment officially. They could click a link that said, 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors who did this posted friendly messages hoping people would buy and like their book. Some even shared"}

To economists, this is interesting because in most places it is free. Yes, families pay for this service through local taxes.

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it might not be as effective as it seems.

Rather", "target_text": "The principle of \"garbage in, garbage out\" can be aptly applied to waste management policy. While charging households per bag of refuse appears both environmentally responsible and economically rational, the actual outcomes may be more complex than anticipated. Across developed nations, municipal waste collection follows a similar pattern: refuse is regularly collected by specialised vehicles and transported to landfill sites. Economists regard this system as unusual, since the service is typically funded through local taxation rather than direct usage fees. Consequently, households generating substantial waste incur the same cost as those producing minimal amounts. Nevertheless, waste disposal entails significant costs. Higher volumes of rubbish necessitate more collection staff, vehicles, and landfill fees, creating a fundamental economic issue: when disposal is free, overproduction of waste becomes inevitable. The apparent solution is to impose charges reflecting the marginal cost of waste disposal, thereby incentivising households to reduce waste and increase recycling—particularly when local authorities provide adequate recycling infrastructure. However, as economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman have demonstrated, this seemingly logical approach yields surprisingly intricate and often disappointing results. Their research examined American municipalities that implemented systems requiring households to purchase stickers for each rubbish bag collected. Analysing one such scheme in Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents paid 80 cents per bag, the economists found that administrative costs exceeded the benefits. Although the number of bags collected declined by 37%, this reduction was largely attributable to the \"Seattle stomp\"—a practice where households compressed approximately 40% more waste into each container. Given that industrial compactors achieve superior compression, the weight of rubbish—a more accurate measure of disposal costs—decreased by only 14%. By comparison, control municipalities without pricing schemes still experienced a 3.5% reduction in waste weight. Furthermore, illegal dumping emerged as a significant unintended consequence, potentially accounting for 30-40% of the apparent reduction in collected waste. While recycling rates increased by 15%, this trend may not be directly attributable to the pricing scheme, as many residents already participated in voluntary recycling programmes. Subsequent research revealed that price increases have minimal impact on waste reduction: a 10% price rise correlates with merely a 0.3% decrease in rubbish. These findings suggest that socioeconomic factors such as income and education may be equally important determinants. Wealthier households, for instance,"}
{"id": "269_A2", "input_text": "simplify to A2: MUSIC AND THEATRE Up until quite recently, I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house, I learned that opera is, in fact, only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That's as it should be, of course. But I come from a different world, the world of the theatre, where the word and the actor speaking it have primacy, where there is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way, and where performer and audience (mostly) speak the same language. At any musical performance, whether in concert hall or opera house, there will generally be a substantial minority of people who, like me, have little technical or academic understanding of music. Some of them will be aware of, possibly even embarrassed by, how much they don't know. Most will be awestruck by the skill of the performers. A dazzling coloratura or an impeccable string section are easy to admire. Even a moderately good musician is showing us the results of years of punishingly hard work. Being in the audience for top-class music is not unlike watching an athletics match - we know athletes are doing something broadly similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also recognise by how much it excess our best efforts. Theatre audiences by contrast, come with a different set of expectations. In the main they do not understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually impressed when an actor completes a long and difficult speech (although 'how do you learn all those lines?' is the question every actor gets asked). None of this means that theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall, indeed quite a lot of them are the same people. What perhaps it does mean is that audiences and performer meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event. The question is, does music need to learn anything from the theatre about this relationship? I would say yes, partly because I have seen how a different approach can transform the concert-goers experience. Music in live performance is inherently theatrical, full of passion, hum", "target_text": "Music and Theatre I thought opera was mainly theatre. But I was wrong. I worked for a short time at an opera house. I learned that music is the most important part of opera. Theatre is second. This is right, I think. But I know the theatre world better. In theatre, the words and the actors are the most important. No one tells the actors what to do during the show. The actors and the people watching usually speak the same language. At a music show, many people are like me. They do not know much about music. Some people feel bad because they do not know much. Most people think the musicians are very good. It is easy to like a singer with a nice voice or a group of good string players. Even a good musician shows us many years of hard work. Watching great music is like watching a sports game. The athletes are doing something we can do, like running, but they are much better. Theatre audiences are different. Most people do not see that acting is hard work. They are not very surprised because acting can look easy. People are not very impressed when an actor says many words. This does not mean theatre audiences are nicer. Many people go to both theatre and music shows. It might mean that in the theatre, the audience and the actors are more like equals. The show can be hard or exciting, but they are together. So, can music learn from theatre? I think yes. I have seen a different way to do a concert. It was better for the people watching. Live music is like theatre. It has strong feelings, fun, and sadness. It can feel close. Sometimes things can go wrong. It makes people think and feel together. But the rules for music shows are often strict. People wear special clothes. They show a lot of respect to the conductor and the main players. This makes a big space between the players and the listeners. It can feel like some people are more important. Sometimes, people clap in the middle of the music. They do this because they like it. But it can break the feeling of the music. Can we change this? Yes. People are trying. They want new people to come to concert halls. They want people to feel that serious music is for them too. I remember a special opera called \"In Search of Angels\". The show moved to different places in a big church and then into the"}

But that changed after I worked for a short time at a national opera house. I learned that in opera, music is the most important thing. Theatre comes second. That is right, I think. But I come from the theatre world, where the words and the actors are the main thing. In theatre, no one tells the actors what to do during the show. Also, the performers and the audience usually speak the same language. At a music performance, like in a concert hall or opera house, there are often many people who do not know much about music. I am one of them. Some people feel a little bad about what they don't know. Most people are very impressed by how good the performers are. It is easy to like a singer with a great voice or a group of musicians who play perfectly. Even a quite good musician shows us the results of many years of hard work. Watching top-level music is a bit like watching a sports event. We know the athletes are doing something like running for a bus, but we see they are much, much better at it. Theatre audiences think about things differently. Most of them do not understand how difficult acting is. They are not very impressed by something that often looks easy, like something they could do. They are not usually amazed when an actor says a long and difficult speech. This does not mean that theatre audiences are nicer or want less than music audiences. In fact, many people go to both. It might mean that in the theatre, the audience and the performer feel more equal. This is true even if the play is very difficult. So, can music learn something from theatre about this? I think yes. I have seen how a different way of doing things can make concerts better for the people watching. Live music is full of drama. It has strong feelings, fun, sadness, and big moments. Sometimes, something can go wrong by accident. It makes the listener imagine things, both alone and as part of a group. But the old ways of music performances can be a problem. For example, there are strict rules about what to wear. Also, conductors and soloists are treated as very special people. This makes a big difference between the players and the listeners.

My view has now changed. After a short time working at a national opera house, I realised that opera is actually only secondarily theatre. The music is the most important element, which is as it should be. However, my own background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor delivering it are central, where there is no one directing the action once the performance has started, and where the performers and audience usually share the same language. At most musical performances, whether in a concert hall or opera house, there is usually a large number of people who, like me, have very little technical or academic knowledge of music.

{"id": "271_C1", "input_text": "simplify to C1: The Lure of the Kitchen When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is, on the face of it, an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long, pressured, menial - and badly paid. But such considerations didn't put me off. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard; the social scene was insular and self-important. Being a chef seemed the perfect antidote to intellectual and social posturing. It promised a seriousness and integrity lacking in my college life. But my desire to cook was not simply a reaction to being a student. It also expressed an aesthetic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards. After this, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretence, distracting me from my true course. I acquired my real education haphazardly and deficiently by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens and preparing extravagant meals. Extract from a novel The school's swimming instructor was an ex-drill sergeant, small and muscle-bound, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pools edge, put my hands above my head and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet. I practised that manoeuvre until the hour was up. The next visit, he got me standing upright, and diving off the edge. The instructor was a martinet and every time I surfaced he looked at me with distaste: 'Don't look down, look up!' 'Keep your legs straight.' 'Point your toes I said!' The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed", "target_text": "The Allure of the Kitchen During my university years, I resolved to pursue a career as a chef—a decision that was unconventional among my peers. Culinary work was not regarded as a prestigious occupation; on the contrary, it appeared distinctly unappealing. Chefs are known to endure gruelling working conditions: the hours are long, the environment is stressful, the tasks are often repetitive, and the remuneration is modest. Yet these drawbacks did not deter me. I was discontented with university life, finding the academic demands strenuous and the social atmosphere insular and pretentious. Becoming a chef seemed the ideal antidote to such intellectual and social affectation. It offered a sense of purpose and authenticity that was absent from my college experience. However, my aspiration to cook was not merely a reaction against student life. It also reflected an aesthetic ideal. This first became apparent during a meal I had at a renowned London restaurant—an experience that proved nothing short of revelatory. I can still vividly recall my starter. By the end of the meal, I felt an overwhelming urge to prostrate myself at the feet of the chef in tearful admiration. For days afterward, I felt buoyant and elated. From that point on, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this extraordinary art form. I reshaped my student life into an extended period of preparation for my entry into the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretence, diverting me from my true vocation. My real education was acquired in a haphazard and incomplete manner—through reading cookbooks, exploring markets and delicatessens, and preparing elaborate meals.

To help with this, I want to find out how work can make us feel happy and complete. Work should not just use us for business. It should be changed to fit all people, women and men. Work should not only be about making money. It should be a good way to live, help us find new talents, and meet different kinds of people. But changing work does not just mean giving jobs to everyone who is unemployed. This is too simple. When people are more educated, they want jobs that are interesting and make life better. We should think of our working life as a kind of art, with the happy person at the center. Even good jobs like being a doctor or an accountant are not as good as they used to be. Doctors are often very stressed. Accountants worry if their job is always right. Most architects cannot be as creative as they want. Managers feel stuck by rules.

His response revealed that he had retained very little information. There is currently a fashionable trend towards embracing internet and computer-based learning, yet the effectiveness of screen-based education remains questionable. One author recounts his experience with an interactive programme he used with his son. While the father conscientiously read the text, his son merely manipulated the images. \"Had he devoted ten minutes to reading a book, he might actually have acquired some knowledge,\" the father remarked. Television, as demonstrated by my son's noodle-eating performance, operates as an impressionistic medium that suggests rather than substantively educates. Research into television and learning indicates that effective learning occurs within an environment where dialogue takes place between students and teachers or parents. Such learning requires mediation. While there is nothing inherently wrong with utilizing new technologies to educate children, formal education continues to play a crucial role. Hollywood By 1918, approximately four-fifths of global film production capacity had shifted to Hollywood. Local residents initially disapproved, perceiving their Los Angeles suburb as contaminated by these new arrivals whom they considered vulgar. However, this snobbery ultimately gave way to the quintessential American value: success, as measured by box office revenue. Hollywood recognizes a successful film when it sees one - a production that might create a star, but must inevitably generate substantial profits. Within less than a century, Hollywood has transformed from an exclusive village into a town as internationally renowned as New York, Rome, or Paris.

He has written many reviews himself. Most reviews are written quickly and are not read for a long time. They are often short because newspapers and magazines only give a little space. People read them for a day, a week, or maybe a month, and then forget them. Many people think that writing reviews is not very important work. They think writers only do it to make money or when they need a break from writing bigger books. But writing a good review is not easy. It is a skill. A short review for a newspaper is different from a long review for a special magazine. A writer must think about who will read the review. Some readers want a quick summary. Other readers want more details. A reviewer must know about many things and must write in a way that is easy for people to understand. Because of this, most people who write reviews also write other things, like books. The famous American writer John Updike sometimes wrote reviews between writing his big novels. He collected his reviews into books. Some people might think that short reviews should be forgotten, but if a writer is proud of their work, why shouldn't they save it? I feel this way about my own reviews. My main job has been as a university teacher. I have written serious books for other teachers. In the English-speaking world, it is normal for teachers to also write reviews. In the past, some people did not like this. They thought teachers should not write for newspapers. But now this happens a lot, and there are many reviews for everyone to write. I think this is good for everyone. Readers can trust that the reviewer knows about the topic. For teachers, it is good because it helps them stay connected to the real world. It reminds them to write clearly so that people who are not teachers can understand them. When teachers talk to each other, they sometimes use difficult words. But when they write for everyone, they need to be clear. In the end, reviewing is a job you do on the side. You can only be a good reviewer if you are also good at another, bigger job."}

It is one thing to write a short review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper. It is another to write a much longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for a serious magazine. A review of 1,500 words for a weekly magazine has its own challenges too. Of course, length is not the only thing to think about. The writer must also think about the reader. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed review. A reviewer needs to know about many things and must write in a way that is clear and interesting for intelligent people. Because of this, most reviewers also write other things, not just reviews. The American writer John Updike does not think very highly of criticism. He calls it \"hugging the shore.\" Still, he writes reviews between working on his big novels. He likes to collect his reviews into books, even the short ones, so they are not forgotten. Maybe other, less famous writers should also be able to keep their reviews in books, especially if they think some of their best writing is in those reviews. I feel this way about my own review writing. My main job has been as a university teacher. Most of my serious books are academic—the kind that professors write. In English-speaking countries, people do not make a big difference between writing reviews and doing academic work. The same people often do both. In the past, other professors would criticize professor-reviewers for showing off or wasting time. But this does not happen much now. Also, other writers used to complain that professors were taking their work, but this is also less common. There are more reviews to write now, so many people can do it, and the pay is often not very high. I think this situation"}

Most reviews are written and published in a way that means they are only read for a short time. There are time limits and strict rules about how long they can be. When they are printed in a newspaper or magazine, they are usually only read for a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, people often think that reviews are not very important. It is commonly believed, by both the public and the writers themselves, that people only write reviews if they have to. The most common reason given is a need for money. Another reason is that you cannot work on a serious book all day long. People think that if they had the choice, they would spend their time on more valuable work. However, writing reviews is a skilled job that requires different abilities. It is one thing to write a short, clear, and fair review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper. It is another thing to write a much longer review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal, where you must still present a strong argument. Writing a fifteen-hundred-word main article for a weekly magazine has its own challenges, combining aspects of both short and long reviews. The length is not the only important thing. The reviewer also needs to think about who will read the review. This could be someone who just reads it quickly at the weekend, or someone who is already very interested in the subject. Finally, a reviewer needs to know about many different things and must be able to write in a way that intelligent people can easily understand and enjoy. This almost always means that the reviewer is also a person who writes other things, not just reviews. The American novelist John Updike, who does not think very highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between working on his major novels. He does not want even his smaller pieces of writing to be forgotten, so he collects all his reviews into books, even though he gives them titles that suggest they are not very important. You might think that less famous writers should accept that their work will be quickly forgotten.

If an animal's success is measured by how many children it has, then being too helpful can be a problem. A very generous animal helps others, but it might not help itself. So why don't the rules of evolution, which say animals should be selfish, seem to work for lions? We thought we could answer this question in two or three years.

It moved away from the serious, sad feelings and loud guitars of the past. Instead, it used lighter, more melodic sounds from local music. The songs mixed social comments and strong feelings with the sounds of fairground organs and brass bands. The album used a lot of humor and singers who kept their local accents. The album showed that Bedrock were clever at collecting ideas and writing songs. Some songs were playful and about typical English things like sunbathing or Sunday afternoons. But the best songs were the sad ones, like \"So Low,\" which is about the weather, and \"To the Brink,\" a serious love song. The great thing about \"New Life\" is that all 16 songs are very good—there are no bad ones.

Lions appear to be ideal social animals, putting aside individual disagreements to work together towards a common aim—their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have developed a more realistic view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions cooperate in hunting, raising their young, and frightening away rivals with group roars. If the ultimate measure of an animal’s behavioural success is the number of surviving offspring it produces in its lifetime, then cooperation does not always provide an advantage: if an animal is too generous, others may benefit at its cost. So why don’t the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions? We were initially confident that we could answer this question in two to three years. But lions are extremely good at doing very little. To the list of inactive noble gases, such as krypton, argon, and neon, we could easily add lion.

It is interesting to ask why this new technology for sending words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this farming idea seem so suitable. Television technology is related to two-way communication like the telegraph and telephone. So it is surprising that from the beginning, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium.

In the early 1930s, radio amateurs in Britain experimented with two-way television that could replace the telephone. Popular science magazines had instructions for building television equipment, and amateurs were active across the country. However, big business, through the British Radio Manufacturers Association, decided on official standards for television in 1938. This pushed the amateur activists out of the market. So, in Britain, the chance for a more community-based, equal form of television communication was lost.

In fact, during the 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places in many countries, including Britain and Germany. The idea of a community-based, two-way television was clearly going to be very limited. Television systems based on public viewing did exist in several countries and could have been a challenge to television becoming a home-based medium, but this challenge did not succeed.

Although television technology is connected to interactive communication systems like the telegraph and telephone, it was imagined from the beginning as a centralised mass medium.

In the early 1930s, British radio amateurs experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for the telephone. Magazines like Radio News published detailed guides for building television equipment, and amateur activity was common throughout the decade.

Computer Modelling The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again,", "target_text": "Metals It might have been a desire to decorate themselves that first made Stone Age people interested in metals. Imagine one of our early ancestors sitting by a river, waiting to catch a fish or just relaxing. They might have noticed a shiny yellow stone and picked it up from the riverbed. It felt different from ordinary stones, and it was beautiful. This is one way gold could have become part of primitive people's lives. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a very popular material. Copper was probably also found by chance. Once people understood how useful copper tools were, they began to search seriously for copper ore and ways to extract the metal from it. In this way, metalworking became another important skill that improved our ancestors' lives. St Ives It was completely silent as we carried our bags along the narrow, stone street into the town centre. We were leaning forward against the strong wind and couldn't avoid the cold waves crashing over the sea wall. The streets were empty, and all the shutters on the seaside houses were closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather getting worse as our small train slowly arrived in St Ives. As the dark grey sky grew heavier, our plan to visit Cornwall out of season—and without a car—started to seem like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come by promising beautiful walks along the coast and cosy evenings sitting by warm fires. Computer Modelling The difficulty with studying history is that it has already happened. The people who lived through good times and bad times are no longer alive. The reasons why they settled in one place or moved to another, or why they formed families and villages, have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some evidence, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on real cultures, whether from the past or present. We cannot go back in time and watch history happen again. Or maybe we can. Computer modelling lets us rebuild ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities. These are digital people who have some of the same needs and abilities as real humans. We can create rules for their behaviour and copy different social groups. Then we can change the conditions—for example, reduce the rain or increase the population—and see how this digital society and its artificial people respond."}

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about, but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. And since the atmosphere is intimately linked every aspect of the planet on which we live, any changes to climate will have significant knock-on effects for plants and animals, as well as water and soils. We humans have learned to use such natural resources to our advantage, enabling us to produce food, build great cities and support six billion members of the human race. Any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously. The problem we have is knowing just how the world will change, and what is causing these changes. There is no doubt, for example, that over the last 100 years or so, human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases -- which are closely related to global temperature. It seems likely that these increased concentrations, which are set to continue building up in the near future, are already affecting global climate, but our poor knowledge and understanding of the global heat balance make the current and future situations uncertain. What we do know is that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have fluctuated in close harmony with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years. This would indicate that the two are almost certainly related. Evidence gleaned from a range of sources suggests that our planet has warmed at the surface by about 6C over the past century. Most scientists think that this trend is unlikely to be natural in origin and is, in part, a result of human pollution of the atmosphere.

Most people know a little about global warming. But no one knows exactly what will happen. A warmer world will mean different weather in all places. Because the air is connected to everything on Earth, changes to the weather will also change plants, animals, water, and land. We use these natural things to live. We grow food, build cities, and have homes. If these things change, it is a big problem. The problem is we do not know how the world will change or why. For about 100 years, people have put more gases into the air. These gases make the world hotter. The gases are still increasing. They are probably changing the world's weather now. But we do not understand everything about the world's heat. We know that when these gases are in the air, the world gets warmer. Scientists think the world's surface is about half a degree hotter now than 100 years ago. Most scientists think this is not natural. They think it is because people make the air dirty. Scientists use computers to guess what will happen with a hotter world. The computers use science rules to understand the weather. But the computer guesses are not perfect. They are simple. Their answers are not exact. The weather is very difficult to understand. Most people agree on one thing: the weather is changing very fast. We use the computer guesses to understand the world our children will live in. The computers say that by the year 2100, the world will be 1 to 3.5 degrees hotter. The sea level will go up by 15 to 95 centimeters. Rain and snow will fall in different places and at different times. Some places will have more very hot days, floods, and dry times. These changes will affect nature and people. Weather changes can move forests and grasslands. The plants and animals there can change. This can hurt the things people need, like food and water. Our farms, our water, and our towns can all be hurt. Some changes may be forever. But not all changes are bad. In some places, changes are good. In Australia, farmers grow more wheat now.

This would indicate that the two are almost certainly related. Evidence gleaned from a range of sources suggests that our planet has warmed at the surface by about 6C over the past century. Most scientists think that this trend is unlikely to be natural in origin and is, in part, a result of human pollution of the atmosphere. A lot of research has gone into predicting the conditions that will result from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs known as general circulation models, or GCMs. They run on powerful computers, use fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to analyse the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation and other climatic factors to predict climatic condition for the past, present or future. Unfortunately, they are simplifications of the real would and have numerous deficiencies. Their results are only approximate and they are also slow to run and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system, although we do realise its complexity. Despite these research difficulties,", "target_text": "The Heat is On We have all heard about global warming, but how much will the Earth's temperature actually rise, and how will it change our lives? Most people understand the basic idea of global warming, but they are not sure what effects it will have. A warmer planet will probably bring changes to weather patterns everywhere. Because the atmosphere is connected to every part of our world, changes in the climate will also have important effects on plants, animals, water, and soil. We humans depend on these natural resources to live. We use them to grow food, build cities, and support a population of billions. Any changes to these resources are a serious problem. The difficulty is knowing exactly how the world will change and what is causing these changes. For example, it is certain that over the last 100 years, human activities have released more of certain gases into the air. These gases are linked to global temperature. It is likely that these increased gas levels, which are still rising, are already changing the world's climate. However, we do not fully understand the Earth's heat system, so the current and future situations are uncertain. What we do know is that the levels of these greenhouse gases and global temperatures have changed together for the past 40,000 years. This strongly suggests that the two are connected. Evidence from different sources shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not natural and is partly caused by human pollution. A lot of research has tried to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models, or GCMs. These programs run on powerful computers and use the laws of physics and chemistry to study how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other climate factors interact. They try to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future. Unfortunately, these models are simplified versions of the real world and have many weaknesses. Their results are only estimates, and they are slow and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not completely understand all the processes in the climate system, although we know it is very complex. Despite these problems, most experts agree on one very important point: the speed of climate change will be faster than anything we have seen before. Because of this, the estimates from GCMs are used to help us understand what the world might be like for future generations. Currently, these models suggest that by the year 2"}

It tells us how far away things are and which way to go. Long ago, people said how far something was by how long it took to walk there. This told them if the walk was easy or hard. Direction was important too, but people mostly asked, \"Which way do I go?\" and \"How far is it?\" For a long time, written directions were as good as maps. Even today, some maps, like train maps, do not show the real direction. Important places on the way were shown with big or small pictures. How a map looked changed with what it was used for. Over time, maps became better and more correct. Map makers got help from other kinds of science. For example, they started using a compass to find direction instead of the sun or stars. They also made tools to measure very well. When people learned more about the world and space, they tried to make maps of all the known world. They learned that Earth is not a perfect ball. It is a little flat at the top and bottom. This helped make better maps of big places. Also, more people needed maps. Soldiers needed very exact maps to see the land clearly. They started using lines to show where land goes up and down. Later, other people like scientists who study old things, history experts, and land experts needed special maps too. Today, map makers show many things on maps, like types of ground, weather, and how people use the land. Because maps are so helpful in science, making maps is popular again. The story of map making did not always get better. Sometimes it stopped. Sometimes it went backwards. New ideas came, but old ideas stayed too. Map makers often had good ideas but needed better tools to make them. Also, because it is easy to copy an old map, some people did not want to change. So, we should not always think that an old map shows what people knew then. The many old maps we have today are from a lot of work and thinking. They are a very important record of our past. This is why learning about old maps is so interesting and helpful."}

To this solitariness was added a fanatic adhesion to a kind of propriety uncommon on the West Earlham estate, which occasionally broke out in furious spring-cleanings or handwashings and instructions to 'behave proper'. As a moral code this was completely beyond my comprehension: even now I'm not sure that I understand it. To particularise, it meant not straying into neighbours' gardens or jeopardising their rose bushes as you walked down the street; it meant sitting for long half-hours in a silent dining room, with your hands folded across your chest, listening", "target_text": "At that time, council houses covered the entire western part of the city: row after row of small, dark homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In summer, chemicals from the May and Baker factory two miles away filled the air around doors and gardens with a strong smell of sulphur. A common sight in that area of Norwich in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked up someone's front path. I have forgotten most of my early life. But I remember sitting, or perhaps balancing carefully, near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later memories include other unclear images—faces I can't name, my mother ironing towels in the back room of a house that might not have been ours, snow falling over the towers of the large mansion at Earlham. It's not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, careful, and almost always angry woman. I never really understood why she was angry, so I couldn't do anything to make her feel better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on trips into the city, I think I noticed that her personality was unusual. For example, she was the most solitary person I have ever known. She seemed as alone in a room full of people as she would be on an empty moor. Added to this loneliness was a strong belief in behaving properly, which was not common on the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense cleaning, frequent handwashing, and instructions to \"behave proper.\" As a moral code, this was completely beyond my understanding. Even now, I'm not sure I fully understand it. Specifically, it meant not walking into neighbours' gardens or damaging their rose bushes when walking down the street. It meant sitting quietly for long periods in the dining room, with my hands folded, listening to radio programmes my mother liked. It meant many other rules and restrictions. Over time, other people appeared in these strict early memories. Despite her solitary nature, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was very interested in the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who hardly ever spoke except to agree with others, and Mrs. La"}

The final story is shaped by the historian's own background and ideas about history. This means that historians are part of creating the evidence. But there are more problems. The person telling the story is also not directly connected to the past. Their memories can be changed by things they heard from other people or from the news. They might remember the past as a very good time, or they might feel angry about a hard childhood, even if that anger came later in life.

The first way is physiology. These scientists study how the animal's body works. They look at how the nerves, muscles, and senses work together to make behaviour. The second way is the 'whole animal' approach. These scientists study the complete animal and what changes its behaviour. They are also interested in how the behaviour happens. In the 'whole animal' group, there are two types of scientists: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in laboratories. They study how a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons, learn. Ethologists study the natural behaviour of animals in the wild. This is behaviour the animals are born with. Today, these two groups are working together more. The physiologists often say their way is the most important. But, even if we knew everything about how nerve cells work, we would still need to study the behaviour itself. Behaviour has its own patterns.

Essentially, historians must recognize their part in producing new historical evidence. However, the challenges continue even after the interview ends.

The music industry earns a lot of money for Britain, and musical skills and talent will continue to be useful for preparing people for different jobs, especially in media. Besides work, there is more and more evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills in young people. Research in the USA shows that both listening to music and making music can improve spatial reasoning, which is one way to measure intelligence. Although we need more studies to be sure, information from Europe shows that more group music lessons can help social relationships in schools and improve concentration in young children and those with behavior problems.

Many things could happen, but I think two are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied. New styles will appear that mix different kinds of music. Second, technology will be used more for composing and performing music. This will make it easier for people to compose music because they will need less technical skill, but it might also mean fewer live performances and fewer jobs for musicians who only perform.

Instead of working harder because they were friends, he became even more difficult to work with. Lancelot quickly looked at the new pages. He saw that almost everything was the same as before. He closed the folder and put it aside. It was clear that Ian would never finish the book. The writing was not very good, and it seemed like Ian didn't really believe in his own idea anymore. Lancelot remembered a story about another famous writer. That writer only finished his book when he was paid a little money at a time. But Ian had already been given all his money at the start. This was the opposite of how things should work. Usually, an author finishes the book first and gets paid later. Lancelot thought back to when they were younger. Ian was the most talented student at Cambridge University. Everyone thought he would be very successful. His friends took over the British theatre world very quickly."}

However, this is not a realistic way to think. You cannot just multiply the number from these village cats by all the cats in Britain. Most cats live in towns. They have smaller areas to hunt and catch fewer animals than the cats in this study. The important question is: can the bird population survive this? The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people give food to birds. Also, garden trees and buildings give birds safe places to nest. This means the number of birds is kept higher than it would be naturally. The study shows that cats are important hunters, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population. **Buffalo's Day** The buffaloes are very important to the people of the marsh, and they are cared for very well.

In what might be considered a moment of vervet ingenuity, the dominant male devised an effective strategy to deter the intruder. Each time the stranger descended from the trees and attempted to cross the open ground toward the group, the dominant male issued an alarm call used by vervets to signal a leopard’s presence. The intruder promptly retreated to the safety of the trees. This tactic was repeated throughout the day, until the dominant male committed a critical error: after several successful attempts, he gave the leopard alarm call while casually walking across open ground himself. What Cats Catch A recent study in the English village of Felmersham, comprising 173 households, recorded the prey brought home by domestic cats. Over the course of a year, the village’s seventy cats returned more than 1,000 prey items. An American professor extrapolated from these figures, estimating that Britain’s cat population must be responsible for the deaths of 100 million birds and small mammals annually. However, the compelling nature of such large numbers appears to have clouded rational judgment. Simply multiplying the catch rate of these rural cats by the total number of cats across Britain is not a realistic approach. The majority of cats in Britain are urban, with smaller territories and lower hunting success rates than those in the study. The central question should have been whether such predation levels are sustainable. Evidence suggests that they are. During winter, many households provide food for birds, while gardens and buildings offer nesting sites, maintaining bird populations well above natural levels. Although the study confirms that cats are significant predators, it does not indicate that they are causing severe harm to Britain’s bird populations. Buffalo's Day Buffaloes are, in effect, the lifeline of the marsh dwellers, and they are treated with corresponding care. Each morning, the buffaloes—having spent the night on their platform or often beside the fire with their owners—set off with extreme slowness"}

Because of this, we asked different social scientists to talk about the ways they study information in their projects. We wanted them to share their ideas about the process, not to write a guidebook for new researchers. This means we wanted to make the unclear parts clearer and easier to understand. This sounds simple, but we found it was not easy. So, we let the writers present their work in different ways, like telling their own stories or writing in a more formal style."}

The writer might think that by inventing stories, they can show the truth about themselves more clearly and effectively than by just sticking to the facts. Or, they might decide from the start not to tell the truth at all. They might call their book an autobiography just to make the reader believe it is true. This makes it easier for them to tell their story.

The economic recession was longer, deeper, and more severe than even the most negative forecasts had predicted, affecting industrialised nations as badly as at any time in thirty years. In Britain in 1991, the situation was clear: the economy shrank, interest rates stayed very high, spending on non-essential goods fell, over half a million people became unemployed, and around 75,000 homes were repossessed. Almost every industry was affected, with sectors like car manufacturing and construction seeing activity drop by as much as thirty percent. While advertising professionals were not the only ones to lose their jobs in such hard times, those who remained employed often felt especially under pressure. Because they are seen as leading the effort to maintain profits, they feel closely watched by colleagues and managers. At the same time, they face the major challenge of having to do their increasingly difficult jobs with ever-smaller budgets. They are expected to achieve more with less. At the same time, there was a growing—and somewhat contradictory—belief in the importance of marketing. The idea that companies should produce what customers actually want, rather than what is simply convenient for them to make, is not new. Still, it is fair to say that only in the previous ten to fifteen years had many firms really started to apply this idea deliberately, not just by chance. As a result, company leaders finally began paying proper attention to marketing, learned a little about it, and some brands started to be marketed in a genuine way. These changes raised the status of marketing staff, but also increased their workload. Marketing began to be seen, incorrectly, as a solution to every problem. With advertising usually making up about half of the marketing budget, it is fair to say that a lot of the responsibility falls on advertising agencies. If the 1980s were a very successful decade for advertising, the start of the 1990s saw the industry experience its worst decline in a generation. This was partly a direct result of the poor economy. However, there were signs of deeper changes that would not disappear when the economy improved.

{"id": "295_A2", "input_text": "simplify to A2: POETRY RECITALS At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it, and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. It is fairly safe to say that, at the present time, there is an especially bewildering complexity of poetic tendencies, of kinds of poetry being written, of warring factions, of ways of presenting, criticising and teaching poetry, and of conflicting beliefs about the role of the poet in society. Very broadly speaking, the present debate in contemporary poetry concerns the reciprocal mistrust and disapproval shown by the seriously committed 'literary' writers, whose poems are intended to be printed and read on the page, and the 'popular', performing poets who, while they will probably publish their verses in magazines and collections, are happier declaiming them to an audience. Of course, this division is far from absolute. The practice of promoting public poetry readings has been steadily increasing over the past twenty years or so, in many different forms. Small literary societies in provincial towns conduct them in village halls or the sitting rooms of their members; schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to audiences of students; arts festivals often advertise poetry readings by well-known authors on their programmes. The consequences of all these events, and of poets being more or less obliged to become public performers, are manifold and of uncertain benefit to them as mists. For the 'pop' poets, whose work has been composed expressly for the purpose of recital to live audiences, the issue is plain. They can only profit from public performance. Their verses are often very simple in both form and content, and can be assimilated at a single hearing; it is on the printed page that the deficiencies of thought, technique and imagination become clear. Poets who are dedicated to their craft, and are doing their best to continue and develop what is finest in the traditions of poetry - which involves compressing the maximum amount of passion, thought, wit and vision into the smallest possible space and achieving rhythmic effects of great variety and subtlety -- are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience which is probably encountering their work for the first time.

They are written to be performed. For serious 'literary' poets, it is more difficult. Their poems are often complex. They use few words to express big ideas and feelings. An audience hearing the poem for the first time may not understand it. The poet might feel they should only read their simplest poems, which are not always their best work. Listening to a poetry reading is not the same as reading a poem yourself. But it can be a helpful and fun extra activity. Hearing the poet read can show you how the poem should sound.

However, if you read these poems in a book, you might notice that the ideas or writing are not very deep. For serious poets, the situation is different. They work hard to put deep feelings, clever thoughts, and beautiful rhythms into their poems. An audience hearing their work for the first time may not understand or like it. The risk for these poets is not that they will copy the popular poets, but that they might only perform their simplest poems to get a quick reaction from the audience.

It is only later, when people look back, that clear patterns and important figures emerge. Currently, poetry is experiencing a particularly confusing variety of styles, competing groups, and different opinions about how poetry should be presented, judged, taught, and what role poets should play in society. In general terms, a major division in modern poetry exists between serious literary poets, who write mainly to be read in print, and popular performance poets, who prefer to present their work directly to audiences, even if they also publish it. These two groups often view each other with mutual distrust, though the distinction between them is not completely clear. Over the past twenty years, the organisation of public poetry readings has steadily increased in many different forms. Small literary societies hold them in village halls or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to read and speak to students; arts festivals frequently include poetry readings by well-known writers in their programmes. The effects of this trend—and the growing expectation that poets should also be performers—are numerous, and it's uncertain whether this development is entirely good for poetry itself. For performance poets, who often write specifically to be heard by live audiences, public readings are clearly beneficial. Their work is usually simple in both structure and content, making it easy to understand when heard once. However, when written down, its weaknesses in thought, technique and imagination may become apparent. Meanwhile, poets dedicated to their art—those trying to continue and develop the best poetic traditions by expressing deep feeling, thought and insight with great precision and subtle rhythmic effects—are unlikely to be properly appreciated by audiences hearing their work for the first time. The danger for these poets is not that they will copy popular performers, but that in trying to communicate immediately, they might read only their most easily understood work, which is often their least significant or representative. Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry privately, though it can be a useful and enjoyable addition. Hearing poets read their work aloud—even if they are not skilled public speakers—provides valuable guidance about where the intended emphasis should be. However, it is better if listeners either follow the reading with the text or already know the poems being read. The main value of popular poetry recitals, which sometimes"}

{"id": "297_B1", "input_text": "simplify to B1: Art on TV Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera, which has the ability to show a whole work of art, then move in close to examine the details. Yet I can think of few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of looking at them. A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture. Dealing in Metals For 20 years I worked as an international metals dealer and gained something of a reputation as a speculator. Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into allegations made against one of the multinational conglomerates that benefit from these cheap raw materials. Extract from a Holiday Brochure Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas that stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer, to Cuba.

Painting and sculpture should be perfect for television. The camera can show a whole work of art and then show small details up close. But I can't think of many TV series that show how interesting and complex art can be. A good example of what often goes wrong is Robert Hughes's eight-part show about American art, called American Visions. Hughes is a good art expert. He is interesting to watch, and he had eight hours to teach British people about American art, which British art galleries usually ignore. I thought the show would be about great works of art. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings. Working with Metals For 20 years, I bought and sold metals around the world. I became known as someone who took risks. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. If you are lucky, you are ready to take a risk, and you understand the market, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this job. This way of working fits well with a free global economy. But now, people who believed free markets would keep the price of rare metals high are seeing the opposite happen. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the cost of raw materials is going down. If you think about inflation, most metals cost about half as much as they did 20 years ago. Recently, someone asked me to check some claims made against a large international company that uses these cheap materials.

Painting and sculpture should be perfect for television because cameras can show a whole artwork and then focus on small details. However, there are very few TV series that successfully show how enjoyable and complex it can be to look at art. A clear example of this problem is Robert Hughes's eight-part program about American art, called American Visions. Hughes is a reliable art expert with a strong personality, and he was given almost eight hours to teach British viewers about a type of art that British museums have paid little attention to. I thought the series would concentrate on important artworks. Instead, it was more about how American history and culture are shown through its art and buildings. Working with Metals I spent 20 years as an international metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. If you are lucky, willing to take chances, and understand how the market operates, you can earn a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this business. This adventurous attitude matches well with a global free-market economy. But now, economists who believed that the market alone would keep the price of rare metals high are discovering the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken from the earth, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When you consider inflation, most metals cost about half as much as they did 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims made against one of the large international companies that profit from these low material costs.

One reason is that we think of art only as a thing, like a painting or a statue. We forget that art is really about how it makes us feel. Some art is very famous. People have liked it for a long time. This can make it hard to see the art in a new way. When art is too famous, it feels far away from normal life and why it was made. This is a problem for people who write about art. Their job is to show how great art is part of our everyday life. Art should not be in a special world. It is part of life, like a mountain is part of the earth. To understand art, we should not only look at famous art. We should look at simple things we see every day. For example, to understand a flower, you need to know about sun and water. To understand art, you need to look at normal life. Many people enjoy movies or music but do not call it art.

There are two main reasons for this. First, people often think a work of art is just a physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue. But real art is about the experience people have with it. When we forget this, we do not understand art well. Second, some art is seen as perfect because people have admired it for a very long time. This creates old-fashioned ideas that stop us from having new thoughts. When a piece of art becomes a 'classic', people often forget the human story of how it was made and how it makes us feel. When we separate art from how it was made and how we experience it, we build a wall around it. This makes its true meaning hard to see. Art is put in a special place, away from everyday life and other normal human activities. So, the job for someone who writes about art is to connect great art back to normal life. Art should not be separate. It comes from our daily experiences, feelings, and actions. Think of mountains: they are not separate from the earth; they are a part of it. In the same way, art is a part of human life. If we accept this idea, we find a surprising conclusion. To understand art, we sometimes need to stop looking at famous artworks. Instead, we should look at the ordinary things in life that we enjoy. We can find beauty in these everyday experiences. To build a theory of art, we must take this different path. Of course, you can enjoy a flower without knowing anything about plants. But if you want to understand why a plant has flowers, you must learn about the soil, air, water, and sun that help it grow. In the same way, to understand great art, you must start with the simple beauty in everyday life. However, many people think of art as something very special and distant. They might not like to hear that the fun things they enjoy—like movies, jazz music, comic strips, or exciting news stories—have artistic quality. For most people, the most lively and interesting arts are things they do not even call 'art'. This happens because when people think of 'real' art, they think of museums and galleries.

One reason is that these works exist as physical objects—buildings, books, paintings, or statues—separate from human experience. But the real work of art is what it does in our experience, so this separation makes it harder to understand. Also, some artworks are seen as perfect and have been admired for so long that they create traditions that stop new ideas. When an artwork becomes a classic, it often seems disconnected from the human conditions that created it and from its effect on real life. When art is separated from how it was made and how it affects us, it becomes hard to see its true meaning. Art is placed in its own special world, cut off from everyday life and other human achievements. So, a key job for anyone writing about art is to reconnect the powerful experiences we get from art with the common events and feelings that make up daily life. Mountains, for example, are not separate from the earth—they are part of it. In the same way, art is part of human experience. If we accept this idea, we reach a surprising conclusion: to understand art, we must sometimes ignore the artworks themselves and look instead at ordinary experiences that we don't usually think of as art. We need to take an indirect path to art theory. Of course, you can enjoy flowers without knowing anything about plants. But to understand why plants flower, you must learn about the soil, air, water, and sunlight that help them grow. To understand art in its best forms, we must start with art in its simplest state—in everyday sights and sounds that catch our attention and give us pleasure. Yet many people think of art as something distant and special. They might be upset to hear that they enjoy their casual hobbies partly because of their artistic quality. The art that most people enjoy today includes things they don't even consider art—like movies, jazz, comics, or exciting news stories. When what is called \"art\" is kept only in museums, people find artistic enjoyment in their daily surroundings. Many who disagree with this museum view of art still share the same mistaken idea—that art is separate from ordinary life. In fact, when great artworks are connected to everyday work and life, people appreciate them most deeply."}

One reason is that these works exist as physical objects. People commonly think of a work of art as the building, book, painting, or statue itself, separate from human experience. But since the real work of art is what the object creates within our experience, this view prevents proper understanding. Furthermore, the outstanding quality of some works, along with the high reputation they have gained from long and uncritical admiration, creates traditions that block fresh perspectives. Once an art object becomes a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human conditions that created it and from its effects on real life. When artistic works are separated from both their origins and their role in experience, a barrier forms that hides their wider meaning—which is what aesthetic theory should address. Art is placed in a special category, cut off from the materials and purposes of other human activities and achievements. This creates a key challenge for anyone writing about the philosophy of art: to reconnect the intense and refined experiences offered by artworks with the common events, actions, and emotions that everyone recognises as part of life. Mountain peaks do not float in the air, nor do they simply sit on the earth—they are the earth itself in one of its visible processes. Experts who study the earth, such as geographers and geologists, work to explain this fact and its consequences. The art theorist has a similar job to do. If we accept this view, even as a temporary experiment, we reach a conclusion that may at first seem unexpected. To understand the meaning of artistic works, we must put them aside for a while and look instead at the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that are not usually seen as aesthetic. We have to approach the theory of art in a roundabout way. After all, theory is about understanding and insight. It is perfectly possible to enjoy the colours and delicate scents of flowers without any knowledge of plant science. But if we want to understand why plants flower, we must learn about the interactions of soil, air, water, and sunlight that allow them to grow. To understand the aesthetic in its most developed and accepted forms, we must start with it in its basic state—in the everyday events and scenes that catch our eye and ear, hold our interest,"}

This can be very frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs. I do not mean 'redundancy' in the usual colloquial sense of material which is unnecessary, but in a technical sense. In a novel, such redundancy would include the repeated allusion to certain traits by which characters are identified, as well as speech tags such as 'he said'. Strictly speaking a character trait needs to be described only once, but it assists comprehension if we are constantly reminded of it. And usually we can infer who is speaking in a scene of dialogue from the content and layout on the page, but speech tags make reading easier. Stage drama, which consists mostly of speech, imitates and reproduces the redundancy of real speech with various degrees of stylisation. In some modern dramas, this is taken to an extreme, so that the dialogue seems to consist almost entirely of redundant language, whose function is purely phatic (merely establishing contact between the two speakers), leaving us in the dark as to what is being communicated. Watching Movies Watching movies, one can be carried away to the degree that one feels part of the world of the moving picture. It is an experience that lifts one out of oneself into a world where one is not beholden to ordinary reality, at least for the length of the film. So it seems that what one feels and does while at the movies does not really count. But as soon as the lights are turned on, the spell is abruptly broken, one is again in the ordinary world. One does not feel responsible for the time spent under the spell of the film and, further, this unreality prevents one from devoting much serious attention to what was considered in my boyhood not an art, but 'mere", "target_text": "**Every Picture Tells a Story** When a book becomes a film, you must make it shorter. You take out many parts. This can be sad for the writer, but it can also help you see the story in a new way. When I wrote a film, I saw I did not need all the words from the book. I could tell the same story. This does not mean the book's words were bad. Books and films are different. They ask you to think in different ways. Books often say things more than once. For example, they tell you again about a person. They also use words like 'he said'. You often know who is talking, but 'he said' helps you read. Plays are mostly people talking. The talking in plays is like real talking. Sometimes, in new plays, the talking does not say much. It just shows two people are speaking. **Watching Movies** When you watch a film, you can feel you are in its world. For a short time, you forget your real life.

This can be upsetting for the writer, but it can also help them understand their own work. While writing a film script, I noticed that I could remove many conversations and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This doesn't mean the book had too many words. It's because books and films are different. They ask the audience to pay attention in different ways. In a book, writers often repeat things to help the reader. For example, they might remind you what a character is like, or use words like 'he said'. You might know who is speaking without these words, but they make the book easier to read. Plays are mostly people talking. The conversations in plays copy real life, where people often say things that aren't very important, just to be friendly. In some modern plays, the characters talk a lot but don't really say anything important. Watching Movies When you watch a film, you can feel like you are inside its world. For a short time, you can forget your normal life and your problems. It feels like what happens in the film doesn't really matter. But when the film ends and the lights come on, you are back in the real world. You don't feel responsible for the time you spent watching the film. In the past, when I was a boy, many people did not think films were art. They thought films were just for fun. Our parents and teachers often said this. They enjoyed being entertained by films, but they didn't think films were a serious art form. The Film Studios The Leiper Film Company studios were a group of many different buildings. The layout of the place was confusing and hard to understand. There were a few main buildings you could remember, like the Script Department. But most of the studios were many small rooms that all looked the same. These rooms were used for meetings. The only way to tell them apart was by a strange system of numbers and letters. Finding the right room without help was very difficult. The studio did not have a clear main entrance, which made it worse. There were three main entrances, and they were all the same. Only one would take you to the right place, but there was no one to ask for directions"}
{"id": "302_B2", "input_text": "simplify to B2: Every Picture Tells a Story Adapting novels for film almost always involves a process of reduction, condensation and deletion. This can be very frustrating for the writer, but also illuminating. Working on a script, I was struck by how much of the dialogue and narrative description in a given scene in the novel I could dispense with, while still getting across the same point. This does not necessarily mean that the dialogue and description of the original were superfluous. It is a matter of the type of attention demanded of the audience by narrative in each medium, and a matter of the type of redundancy each employs.

This can be upsetting for the writer, but it can also be interesting. While writing a script, I noticed how much of the book's conversation and description I could remove and still keep the same meaning. This doesn't mean the original writing was unnecessary. It's because books and films require different kinds of attention from the audience, and they use repetition in different ways. I don't mean 'repetition' as something useless, but as a technical part of storytelling. In a book, this repetition includes regularly reminding the reader about a character's main features, or using phrases like 'he said'. A character's trait only needs to be described once, but it helps the reader if it is mentioned again. We can usually understand who is speaking from the words on the page, but 'he said' makes it easier to follow. Plays, which are mostly dialogue, copy the repetition of real conversation, sometimes in a very artistic way. In some modern plays, the dialogue is almost all repetitive language that just keeps the conversation going, leaving the audience unsure of the real meaning. Watching Movies When you watch a film, you can become so involved that you feel you are inside the movie's world. It's an experience that takes you away from your normal life for a few hours. Because of this, it can feel like your feelings and actions in the cinema don't really matter. But as soon as the film ends and the lights come on, the feeling disappears and you are back in the real world. You don't feel responsible for the time you spent lost in the film. Also, this unreal feeling stops people from taking films seriously. When I was young, many people, including our parents and teachers, did not see films as art. They called them 'just entertainment'. They enjoyed being entertained, but they didn't believe movies were a true art form. The Film Studios The Leiper Film Company studios were a group of many different buildings.

New books about his journey on the ship Endurance are being published and are expected to sell quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is preparing a large exhibition, and a film company is making a movie about his life. Some American managers also see Shackleton as a role model.

Jim MacGregor, a senior partner at a New York firm, chose Shackleton as his role model years ago. His company focuses on communication during company mergers, takeovers, and crises. For example, what to do if a factory explodes or many jobs must be cut. It might seem strange to connect surviving in freezing conditions with managing a modern business crisis, but MacGregor sees the link. \"Even if a company handles a crisis well, it can still cause damage by communicating poorly,\" says MacGregor. \"Shackleton is a model because of his leadership and communication skills. He knew what was important. He was at his best when he and his team had everything to lose – even their lives. One of his most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This showed that his team's safety was his main concern.\" This refers to his 1908 expedition when, running out of supplies, he made the brave choice to return. In a crisis, MacGregor says, people need to know that someone is in control. While managers today often try to avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to stand up and take charge. His 1914 expedition is the one that made him famous. His ship, the Endurance, was stuck in ice for nine months and was finally destroyed. When it sank, Shackleton told his men they would"}

But now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are in production and are expected to spring off the shells as fast as they are stacked; the American Museum of Natural History is mounting a grand exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is preparing a film based on Shackleton's life.

He prioritised his values and performed best when he and his team had everything to lose—including their lives. One of his most remarkable decisions was to turn back just 97 miles from the South Pole.

And not, thankfully, by some huge-budget, mega-hyped, multi-media extravaganza, but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art -- that is art which is concerned with movement -- in the twentieth century. In the process, it reveals that making artworks which either move by themselves or investigate the idea of movement in some way has been a consistent if largely unrecognised theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. And not only that -- the marvellous range of paintings and drawings, documents and films on kinetic art assembled by curator Guy Brett, who has made a life-long study of the subject, are presented largely unmediated by text. Visitors, unharried by explanations, are left to have the pleasure of making connections and discoveries for themselves. David Hockney Hockney's work appeals to a great many people who might otherwise display little interest in art. It may be that they are attracted to it because it is figurative and, therefore, easily accessible on one level, or because the subject matter of leisure and exorcism provides an escape from the mundanities of everyday life. Perhaps it is not even the art that interests some people, but Hockney's engaging personality and the verbal wit that makes him such good copy for the newspapers. He may, in other words, be popular for the wrong reasons. But does this negate the possibility that his art has a serious sense of purpose? In the view of some respected critics, Hockney is nothing more than an overrated minor artist. To this one can counter that Hockney might seem minor because it is unacceptable today to be so popular, rather than because his work is lacking in substance. Hockney himself is not self-deluding; he is aware of his limitations and thinks that it is beside the point to dismiss his work because it does not measure up to an abstract concept of greatness. Hockney does not claim to be a great artist and is aware that only posterity can form a final judgement", "target_text": "**Kinetic Art** Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London is now a wonderful place to visit. A new show looks at art from the last 60 years. It is about kinetic art. This is art that moves. The show tells us that making art that moves is an old idea. A man named Guy Brett put the show together. He collected many paintings, drawings, and films. There is not much writing to read. People who visit can have fun looking and learning on their own. **David Hockney** Many people like David Hockney's art. Even people who do not usually like art like his work. Maybe they like it because it shows things they know. Or maybe they like the pictures of people having fun. Some people might like Hockney because he is a friendly and funny man. So, maybe people like him for simple reasons. But is his art still good? Some art experts say Hockney is not a very important artist. But other people say he is popular, so he is important. Hockney knows his art is not perfect. He does not say he is a great artist. He thinks only people in the future can decide if his art is important. **Window-shopping - an art exhibition** I have seen many new art shows. Some were very good. Some were not good. I do not like shows where all the art has to be the same. Sometimes this is okay. But often, it is not a good idea. So, I wanted to make a different kind of show. I worked with seven artists in a big empty room. The show was called 'Window-shopping'. It had many different kinds of art. The only thing the same was that they were all art. One artist made small cats from wool. They ran on a toy train. Another artist made a video of a broken camera. The picture moved and then stopped. These artworks were not the same. They are not usually in a show together. But that is okay. They were all good next to each other. I am not saying something big about art. Art is something each artist does in their own way. **Art History** People who like paintings sometimes do not want to learn about them. They think learning will make looking less fun.

Something amazing has happened at London's Hayward Gallery. This usually serious gallery is now full of wonderful things. The change didn't come from a big, expensive show. It came from a special look at an art style from the last 60 years that many people have forgotten. A new exhibition shows the history of kinetic art. This is art that moves. The exhibition shows that for a long time, artists have made art that moves or is about movement. This has been an important idea in modern art, even if not many people knew about it. The show has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Expert Guy Brett chose them all. There is very little text explaining the art. This means visitors can have fun finding their own connections and discoveries. **David Hockney** Many people who don't usually like art enjoy Hockney's work. Maybe they like it because it shows real things, so it is easy to understand. Or maybe they like the pictures of free time and happy places, which feel like an escape from normal life. For some people, it might not be the art they like, but Hockney's friendly personality and clever talking. This makes newspapers want to write about him. So, he might be famous for reasons that have nothing to do with his art. But does this mean his art is not serious? Some important critics think Hockney is not a very important artist. But another way to see it is this: Hockney might seem unimportant only because he is very popular, not because his work is bad. Hockney knows his own limits. He thinks it is wrong to say his art is bad just because it isn't \"great\" in a special way. Hockney does not say he is a great artist. He knows that only people in the future can decide how important his art really is. **Window-shopping - an art exhibition** In the last few years, I have seen many modern art shows.

{"id": "309_B1", "input_text": "simplify to B1: Love them, fear them, worship them, human culture has always had a lot to say about birds. But what does that say about us? Paul Evans reports There's a bump, bump, bump coming from the greenhouse as a little brown shuttlecock bounces against the glass. It turns out to be a wren: an ominous bird, a bird of portent, augury and divination. Is it spelling out some sort of message from a world at the very edges of my imagination? Or is it just a poor bird stuck in a greenhouse? Depending on your point of view, both could be true. Wrens have been flitting through the undergrowth of British culture ever since it began. In medieval times, a complicated system of observing the directions in which wrens flew determined the sort of luck the observer would experience. In modern times, the image of the wren remains in pictures and ceramics in many British households. Even though the early beliefs may have been watered down or even forgotten, the wren still has a perch in our consciousness and a nest in our affections. A wood without wrens is a sad, impoverished place. This is almost certainly because there is a rich vein of folklore running through our relationships with many birds which reaches back to a time when people read the world around them differently. Where people are, necessarily, hitched more directly to natural processes for their very survival, they develop an ecological and cultural language through which the significance of other creatures is communicated. This significance is, of course, prone to cultural shifts that cause major image changes for the creatures involved. A good example of this is the red kite. During the early sixteenth century, foreign visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take bread from the hands of children. These birds were protected and valued urban scavengers. But it was not long before they began to be seen as vermin, and as a result were soon wiped out in most areas apart from Wales. Gradually red kites began to assume a romantic personality linked to this Celtic stronghold and they have now become totemic birds of British conservation, protected again and reintroduced with a view to helping them regain their", "target_text": "People have always had strong feelings about birds. We love them, we are afraid of them, and sometimes we even worship them. But what does this tell us about ourselves? Paul Evans writes about this. In the greenhouse, I hear a small noise. A little brown bird is hitting the glass. It is a wren. In the past, people thought wrens could tell the future. Is this bird trying to send me a message from another world? Or is it just a bird that is trapped? Maybe both ideas are true. Wrens have always been a part of life in Britain. Long ago, people believed that the direction a wren flew could tell you if you would have good or bad luck. Today, you can still see pictures of wrens in many British homes. We may not believe the old stories anymore, but we still like wrens. A forest without wrens feels empty. This is because we have many old stories about birds. A long time ago, people's lives depended on nature. They created stories to explain the world and the animals in it. These stories can change over time. For example, the red kite was once a common bird in London. People protected them because they cleaned the streets. But later, people saw them as pests and killed them. They only survived in Wales. Now, people think of red kites as special birds of Wales. We protect them again and are helping them return to other parts of the country. Our connection to animals is very old. The first humans watched birds carefully. Birds could warn them about danger, bad weather, or where to find food. People also thought birds had a connection to the spirit world. But it is more than that. When we ask why birds are important to us, we are also asking what it means to be human. We admire their flight, their songs, and their freedom. Some people might say these feelings are not important today. But these feelings are still a part of who we are, and losing them would be sad. This is probably why birds are now seen as signs of the health of our environment. In Britain, 30 types of birds are in danger. This is sad not just because we are losing the birds, but because we are losing a part of our culture too. These birds are important in our stories. For example, the skylark, turtle do"}

But what does this tell us about ourselves? Paul Evans investigates. In my greenhouse, I hear a soft bumping sound. A small brown bird is hitting the glass. It's a wren - a bird that people have long believed could predict the future. Is it trying to send me a message from another world? Or is it simply a bird that can't find its way out? Both ideas could be true, depending on how you look at it. Wrens have been part of British culture for centuries. In the Middle Ages, people thought the direction a wren flew could tell you whether you would have good or bad luck. Today, many British homes still have pictures or decorations showing wrens. Even though people no longer believe in the old superstitions, wrens remain special to us. A forest without wrens feels empty and sad. This connection comes from our long history of folklore about birds. In the past, when people depended more directly on nature for survival, they developed ways of understanding animals that became part of their culture. These meanings can change over time. Take the red kite, for example. In the 1500s, visitors to London were surprised to see these birds taking bread from children's hands. People valued them as city cleaners. But later, people began to see them as pests and killed most of them, except in Wales. Eventually, red kites became symbols of Welsh heritage and are now protected birds that conservationists are helping to return to other areas. Our relationship with birds goes deeper than culture and connects to our basic human nature. Early humans watched birds carefully because birds could warn them about danger, bad weather, or where to find food. Birds also seemed to connect them to spiritual worlds. When we ask why birds matter to us, we're really asking what makes us human. We admire their ability to fly, their songs, and their freedom. Our fascination with birds helps us understand our own place in nature. Some might say these feelings are leftovers from our evolutionary past that no longer matter. But like wisdom teeth, they're still part of who we are, and losing them would be painful. This might explain why birds have become important indicators of environmental health in recent years.

But what does this reveal about us? Paul Evans investigates. A faint, repetitive tapping emanates from the greenhouse—a small brown wren, fluttering against the glass. In folklore, the wren is a bird of omen, associated with prophecy and foresight. Is this visitor conveying a message from realms just beyond my imagination, or is it merely a trapped bird? Depending on one’s perspective, both interpretations may hold truth. Wrens have been woven into the fabric of British culture since its earliest days. In medieval times, complex systems of divination were based on observing the direction of a wren’s flight. Today, their image persists in household ceramics and artwork. Even as ancient beliefs have faded or been diluted, the wren retains a place in our collective consciousness and affections. A woodland devoid of wrens feels barren and diminished. This enduring connection stems from a deep-seated folklore that underpins our relationships with numerous bird species—a legacy from an era when humans interpreted the natural world through a different lens. In societies more directly dependent on natural cycles for survival, people developed an ecological and cultural vocabulary to express the significance of other living beings. This significance, however, is subject to cultural shifts that can dramatically alter a species’ perceived image. The red kite offers a compelling example. In the early sixteenth century, visitors to London were astonished to see these birds snatching bread from children’s hands. At that time, red kites were protected and valued as urban scavengers. Yet, within a relatively short period, they came to be regarded as vermin and were consequently eradicated from most regions, surviving only in Wales. Over time, the red kite acquired a romantic association with this Celtic refuge and has since become an emblem of British conservation—reintroduced and protected in an effort to restore its former range. Our bond with other species transcends culture and is rooted in the evolution of human nature. Early humans observed birds not only to detect predators, predict weather, or locate food sources,"}

The converse is that good writing comes hard. Looking back though my handwritten school essays I was surprised at how few crossings-out they contained. Today I would have rewritten them five times over. I am sure the reason was that they were physically hard to write. The slowness of the hand disciplined the brain. What would be difficult to alter or erase was written with care. The casual facility of the computer leads to sloppiness. Most writers using word processors find the time spent correcting early drafts more or less equates with the time originally spent on handwritten text. Equally, the e-mail, unlike the handwritten letter, is emotionally ponderous. This electronic Eros is said to have revive the art of the love letter. Millions of these missives now flow down the lines, where previously there was only idle chatter. Hurrah for that. At least these e-mails are written, in a sort of English and a sort of grammar: But words printed on a screen pack a monotonous punch. Their writers are often unaccustomed to the power of the written word and tend, in computer jargon, to 'flare'. Their meaning becomes exaggerated and distorted in transmission. And printed words written in haste lack the care and character of handwriting. The CD I put down my cup and went to inspect the CD. The case was disappointing but the rainbow-silver disc inside looked interesting. 'Wonderful little things, aren't they?' Mr Warriston said, coming back into the room. I agreed, gingerly handing the disc to him. 'Amazing they manage to squeeze seventy minutes of music onto them,' he continued, bending to the hi-fi device. He switched it on and all sorts of lights came on. He pressed a button and a little drawer slid out of the machine. He put the disc inside, pressed the button again and the tray glided back in again. 'Of course, some people say they sound sterile, but I think they...' 'Do you have to turn them over, like records?' I asked. 'What?", "target_text": "Dr Johnson asserted that 'what is written without effort is generally read without pleasure,' implying that quality writing demands considerable exertion. Reviewing my handwritten school essays, I was struck by how few corrections they contained. Today, I would have revised them repeatedly. I suspect this was because the physical effort of writing by hand imposed discipline on the mind. The difficulty of making alterations compelled careful composition. In contrast, the ease of computer use often results in carelessness. Most writers using word processors discover that the time spent revising initial drafts roughly equals that previously devoted to handwriting. Similarly, email lacks the emotional resonance of handwritten correspondence. While digital communication is said to have revived the art of love letters, with countless messages now transmitted where once there was only trivial conversation, this development is not entirely positive. Although these emails are composed using basic English and grammar, words displayed on screen deliver a monotonous impact. Unpracticed writers frequently overstate their meaning, causing distortion in communication. Moreover, hastily typed messages lack the considered thought and personal touch characteristic of handwriting. **The CD** I set down my cup and examined the CD. The packaging was unimpressive, but the iridescent disc inside appeared intriguing. \"Remarkable inventions, aren't they?\" Mr. Warriston remarked upon returning. I concurred, carefully passing him the disc. \"It's astonishing how they compress seventy minutes of music onto such a small surface,\" he continued, leaning toward the audio system. Activating the device, he pressed a button causing a tray to slide out. After placing the disc inside, he retracted the tray. \"Some critics claim the sound lacks warmth, but I believe...\" \"Do you need to flip them over, like vinyl records?\" I inquired. \"Certainly not,\" Mr. Warriston responded, standing upright. \"Only one side is playable.\" \"Why is that?\" I asked. He appeared momentarily perplexed, then contemplative. \"You know, I've never considered that.

The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too. Too Much Choice Society is becoming 'overchoiced'. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins. Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep track of.

Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews", "target_text": "Amateur Astronomy A lot has changed in astronomy over the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, charts and catalogues were hard to find. Telescopes and equipment were limited, and there were not many books about practical astronomy. Today, you can buy almost any kind of telescope or equipment you might need. Electronic calculators and computers have completely changed how almanacs and charts are made. They also make it much easier to study observations and share the results. You might think this is the best time ever for amateur astronomers. Perhaps, but we have also lost a lot. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometres to find a sky as clear as the one you could see in cities fifty years ago. During the day, the sky is often covered with airplane trails. These trails can last for hours and spread out to form shapeless clouds. This makes it impossible to observe the sun and also causes problems for observing at night. Too Much Choice Our society now offers too many choices. There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many chances. In the modern economy, people strongly want the newest product, service, or trend. Technology makes this happen even faster: there is more noise and more new goods and services, which means more and more choice. As soon as one new product appears, the next one is ready to be released. This makes people feel dizzy, their minds work too fast, they become tired, and they start to feel disconnected from real life. Choice is a key idea in the new economy, but more choice leads to more stress, less free time, and greater complexity. Because of this, a new trend is starting. People are looking for 'simplexity' – the simple things that are meaningful in our complicated world. However, simplifying your life is difficult when there is so much available. There are more basic types of washing powder and breakfast cereal than we could ever need or want. There are also more software updates, special functions, and phone plans than we can easily follow. McAndrews Hotel Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition that my grandmother started, and now it feels very important to us.

Lester plays a young man who is often angry and worried. He is quick, watches everything, and tries very hard. He is also funny. This makes him strong and nice. You can see he is very skilled.

A great deal of this criticism is brought about by the actors themselves, when film or theatre companies require them to talk about their profession in interviews. They should follow the example of the dancer Pavlova, who, when asked what her dancing expressed, answered: \"If I could explain it, I wouldn't need to dance it.\" Yet they frequently use overly serious clichés, meaningless statements, or get drawn into sensational gossip. We should remember what Paul Scofield wrote to a friend: \"I have discovered that an actor's work is only alive and interesting when it is being performed. It loses its power when talked about, becoming theoretical and without substance. It has no rules, except perhaps the need to be heard. With every new play and playwright, the actor starts from the beginning, as if knowing nothing, and learns again, developing through the characters' relationships and the writer's understanding.

His understanding of the language and his control over his body and emotions quickly establish him as a leading actor—one whose smart self-assurance allows him to be almost modest. Lester plays a nervous, easily annoyed young man who is driven by hidden anger. He is quick, observant, and determined, using sharp humour and a warm sense of fun that makes his character both powerful and likeable. Although it is not showy, the great skill of his performance is clear. Watch Lester's body, how his arms hang rigidly, creating the impression of a person ready to come to life. Handy's performance as Horatio gives a similar feeling of a body guided by an inner energy that he partly understands and partly does not. This makes us ask important questions: What is acting? What is behaviour? Is acting a copy or a representation of behaviour? Who, or what, brings these bodies to life, in both a moral and physical sense?

For Joanna MacGregor, however, it was simply amusing. \"In his view, until I played that tune, I hadn’t proved myself. I wasn’t a real pianist.\" Naturally, she performed it effortlessly and will likely include the idea in her next children’s concert. MacGregor is unusual among leading concert pianists because of her interest in how children learn the instrument. She has recently published her own beginner piano book for children: Joanna MacGregor’s Piano World. She managed this despite her demanding work schedule. She seems to be performing at nearly every music festival this summer. Tomorrow she is deeply involved in an all-day project with nine young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She admits that whenever she meets an artist, she is tempted to start a joint project. So why take on the additional responsibility of writing a book? \"People who know me are certainly surprised. But I believe the first lessons are absolutely essential. The music profession often concentrates only on the most talented children, the potential future stars. However, most people’s interest in music is much more ordinary and everyday. I find that far more interesting!\" In creating these first three books, MacGregor draws on her own vivid experiences. Between the ages of 18 and 25, before she began performing as a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. But the most significant influence was the constant stream of children who came to her childhood home for piano lessons with her"}

So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano? Even a member of that mythical species, the completely tone deaf, could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Simply to see her zipping around a keyboard grabbing fistfuls of notes at the behest of some unfeasible contemporary score is to watch a pianist pushing the human frame to its limits. But even her dazzling virtuosity was not enough to was one small boy at a recent concert she gave for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he had been cascaded with bits and bobs of pieces in every style from her vast repertoire of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African, etc. He'd coolly watched her dive under the lid of the concert grand to pluck the wires - normally a surefire knockout for kids. Then as she drew breath and invited questions, he piped up: 'Can you play Match of the Day?' How many veterans of the concert hall platform would be floored by such a request? For Joanna MacGregor, though, it was simply a hoot. 'In his eyes, until I played that, I hadn't passed the test. I wasn't a proper pianist.' Needless to say, she sailed through and doubtless logged the experience for her next children's recital. MacGregor is rare among top-flight concert pianists for the interest she takes in how young children learn the instrument. She has just published her own elementary piano tutor for children: Joanna MacGregor's Piano World. And she has managed it despite a crippling work schedule. There hardly seems to be a festival this summer she is not gracing. Tomorrow she is in the thick of an all-day collaboration between nine young composers and artists. She runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. And by her own admission, she cannot meet an artist of any sort without being tempted to suggest a joint project. So why on earth take on the extra burden of writing a book? 'People who know me are clearly surprised. But I think", "target_text": "Joanna MacGregor maintains a demanding schedule as a concert pianist, so what has motivated her to take on the additional responsibility of writing instructional books for young piano students? Even someone with no musical ability whatsoever could not help but be captivated by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Merely observing her navigate the keyboard with remarkable speed, executing complex contemporary compositions, provides a glimpse of a musician testing physical limits. Yet even her extraordinary technical skill failed to fully satisfy one young audience member at a recent children's concert. Like others present, he had been treated to diverse musical excerpts drawn from her extensive repertoire spanning classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, and world music. He remained unimpressed even when she reached inside the grand piano to manipulate the strings—typically a guaranteed success with younger listeners. When she paused for questions, he immediately inquired: \"Can you play the Match of the Day theme?\" Many established concert artists might have been disconcerted by such a request, but MacGregor found it genuinely amusing. \"In his view,\" she noted, \"until I played that piece, I hadn't proven myself as a real pianist.\" Naturally, she performed it flawlessly and will likely incorporate the piece into future children's recitals. MacGregor stands out among elite concert pianists for her dedication to understanding how children learn music. She has recently published her own introductory piano method for children, accomplished despite an overwhelming professional schedule. Her festival appearances this summer are numerous, and tomorrow she participates in an intensive collaborative project involving nine composers and visual artists. She also manages her own record label, and confesses she frequently proposes joint ventures when meeting other artists. Given these commitments, why would she assume the extra work of authoring a book? \"Those who know me have expressed surprise,\" she acknowledges. \"However, I believe initial music instruction is fundamentally important. The music profession often focuses excessively on exceptional talent and virtuosity, whereas most people engage with music in more ordinary ways. I find this ordinary engagement far more compelling.\" In developing her instructional materials, MacGregor draws on substantial teaching experience. Before establishing her concert career between ages 18 and 25, she taught numerous beginning piano students. Most influential, however, was her childhood exposure to the steady stream of students taught"}

For example, we might consider that the casual reader of a newspaper will have an implicit understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the page. But rather than accepting the photograph at face value, we might question whether it accurately recorded the scene as it would have looked at the time. Or, in contrast, does it communicate the photographer's point of view? Is it the precise instant recorded that is of particular importance, or should the photograph on the page be understood as a symbol to represent a state of affairs in the world?

There is only one way to be the best. You must not do other things. Sport is very hard, and no one can do it for you. You must try hard, or you will not do well. Sport taught me to be strong and to not give up. It also taught me how to work with a team. In my sport, you can be good alone, but it is a team game. You must do both. This is like life. You can do well alone, but you must remember other people. Sport gave me many good things, not just money. It let me do new things and see new places. I saw parts of the world that other people do not see. But to get these good things, you must also stop doing other things. **Listening to a bird** Some memories are very clear. One clear memory for me is from a night in California long ago. I was in bed but awake. A bird was singing very beautifully in a tall tree. I could not see the bird. I usually sleep well, but the bird's song was too good. I listened to the song and felt happy. To understand the song, I thought about jazz and Indian music I know. The bird seemed to be making a new song just for me. I lay by the window and listened. The song changed many times and was wonderful. In the end, I fell asleep."}

Writers can talk about a problem we thought only we had. They can say what we feel, but in a better way. They write clearly about things that make us feel shy or unsure. This is special when the writer lived long ago or far away. We feel happy that these writers help us know ourselves. Reading and travel help us see new things. We look more carefully when we are in a new place. Great books also help us see new things. They show us interesting parts of life we did not see before. Our mind starts to notice more. We see the sky's colors, how a person's face changes, or when a friend is not true. We may feel a little sad about something and not know why. Author's Note I wrote these travel stories for a newspaper over seven years. I put back a few words that were cut. I did not add much. I fixed some small mistakes. I could have changed more, but then I would never stop. For example, in one story about China, I wrote that the Hong Kong dollar was strong. One year later, it was weak.

In the works of others, we encounter our own reflections, embarrassments, and personal dramas. Writers find words for situations we believed we were alone in experiencing, or they articulate our own thoughts with a clarity and emotional precision we could not achieve ourselves.

He had had a long conversation with my headteacher, and now here we were bound for home and holidays. 'What isn't?' I said, though I had guessed the trend of his thoughts from my father's unusual silence. He was a talkative man as a rule. 'You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,' he said.

'I don't know about that,' I said. 'All I know is what I see in television dramas.' 'Be that as it may,' he went on, pulling himself together, 'I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now.

This profile matches the envisioned first astronauts to Mars, should billionaire Dennis Tito’s proposal to launch a spacecraft on 5 January 2018 come to fruition. The capsule would transport the crew to an altitude of approximately 160 km above the Martian surface. The spacecraft would utilize Mars’s gravitational field to slingshot back toward Earth without expending additional fuel—fuel efficiency being a critical consideration. The 2018 launch date is essential, as the next favorable alignment of Earth and Mars will not occur until 2031. While this appears to be a standard undertaking, there is an urgent push to develop systems based on entirely new technologies. Provided these innovations can be implemented in time, the mission may well succeed. Even if the spacecraft never departs from Earth, the pursuit of such ambitious objectives will not be futile, as it will yield significant technological progress for subsequent space missions."}

Because of the high price and the interesting design, James and Ian started to make their own bamboo bikes. They worked for years in a small building in Wales.

First, you build the main part of the frame with thick bamboo. Then you add the thinner seat and chain parts. For the handlebars and wheels, you use metal tubes because metal is stronger for these parts. For someone like me, who is not good at DIY, this was a big step. Cutting the bamboo in the right way is not easy. James and Ian walked around the room and helped everyone. They watched every cut and checked every join. They helped if a job was too difficult. Many people on the course were engineers who enjoy building things. For people like me, Ian said it is normal to make a mistake once or twice. But that is okay.

Lake Vostok In the heart of Antarctica, nothing stirs. On the fringes of the continent there are penguins, seals and birds aplenty. But up on the great white plateau in the interior, life has no foothold. Except, that is, in a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometres of ice, directly below the coldest spot on earth. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists can hardly wait to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within. Geologists and glaciologists are hot on their heels. For two years now, researchers round the world have been plotting ways to uncover the lakes secrets, and, if they get their wish, in the next few years we will witness the decade of Lake Vostok.

It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists; the expression 'because it's there' springs to mind. Sure we all know its the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from the atom to the black hole.

At the edge of the land, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But inside, on the big white flat land, there is no life. But there is one special place. A very big, hidden lake is there. It is called Lake Vostok. It is under a lot of ice. It is under the coldest place on Earth. The water has had no air or sun for a very, very long time. Scientists want to look in the deep water. They want to find strange life there. Other scientists want to do this too. For two years, people from many countries have tried to learn the lake's secrets. If they can do it, we will know more about Lake Vostok soon. **Scientists** I heard something interesting on the radio last week. Some scientists are talking about a question. The question is: why do people become scientists? We know that scientists want to learn new things. They want to understand the world. But these scientists want to know why we want to know these things. And why can't science answer this question? I think it is more important to ask if what we scientists do is good. We should not talk too much about why we do it. The important thing is to see that science is a tool. We are the people who must choose how to use this tool. We must choose when and why to use it."}

And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production. Lake Vostok In the heart of Antarctica, nothing stirs. On the fringes of the continent there are penguins, seals and birds aplenty. But up on the great white plateau in the interior, life has no foothold. Except, that is, in a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometres of ice, directly below the coldest spot on earth. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists can hardly wait to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within. Geologists and glaciologists are hot on their heels. For two years now, researchers round the world have been plotting ways to uncover the lakes secrets, and, if they get their wish, in the next few years we will witness the decade of Lake Vostok. Scientists There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists; the expression 'because it's there' springs to mind. Sure we all know its the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from the atom to the black hole. But what these guys want to know is why we want to know all of this in the first place and why can't science explain why we want to know? ", "target_text": "**Othello** A very good production of Shakespeare's play Othello has moved from Stratford to London. This lets me fix a review I wrote last spring that was not fair. At that time, I said Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello, and I was wrong about his acting. I still think it is a problem that Othello and Desdemona are shown as the same age. But I must say that the rest of Mr Fearon's acting is very good. In fact, all the actors are very good. You will remember the scene where Cassio's games with other officers become dangerous. You will also remember when Iago starts to lose control and must calm down. I am sure everyone will feel sad and want to cry when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The play moves at a good speed and is very exciting. You should go and see it. **Lake Vostok** In the middle of Antarctica, nothing moves. At the edge of the continent, there are many penguins, seals and birds. But on the big white flat land inside, there is no life. There is one special place, however. A huge hidden lake of fresh water called Lake Vostok is under almost 4 kilometres of ice. It is in the coldest place on Earth. The water has had no air or sun for up to 25 million years. Biologists really want to study the deep water and find what strange life is there. Other scientists who study rocks and ice are also very interested. For two years, researchers from around the world have been planning how to learn the lake's secrets. If they can do it, in the next few years we will learn a lot about Lake Vostok. **Scientists** I heard something interesting on the radio last week. Some scientists are getting upset. They are asking why they want to be scientists. We often say it is 'because it's there'. Of course, we know it is about the old search for knowledge. We want to understand everything, from the smallest things to black holes in space. But these scientists want to know why we want to know these things. They also ask why science cannot explain why we want to know. I think it is more important to know if what we scientists are doing is correct. We should not talk too much"}
{"id": "330_B2", "input_text": "simplify to B2: Othello The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance.

I still believe it changes the story to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but I must admit I was wrong about the rest of Mr Fearon's wonderful performance. In fact, the entire cast is wonderful. Some unforgettable scenes are when Cassio's competitive games with the other young officers become dangerously wild, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and has to fight to calm himself down. I don't think anyone can avoid crying during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The speed and excitement of the play are excellent.

This water has been completely cut off from air and sunlight for as long as 25 million years.
