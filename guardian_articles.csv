"Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and rose all the way to its top but even he struggles to recall a Latin American year like 2019. “Like this? Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region. “Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day. Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew. “There hasn’t yet been a popular reaction [against Bolsonaro] – but I think it will come. If there’s a small spark it could very easily propagate,” he said. But perhaps not quite yet. “Everything here in Brazil is slow,” Amorim admitted. “Except samba.”"
"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago. The embassy was under lockdown but had not been evacuated, the spokesperson said, with diplomats sheltering in a safe-room. Video from the scene showed thick grey smoke engulfing the compound against a backdrop of wailing from an emergency siren. Protesters shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. By nightfall fires were still burning. One masked man walked off insouciantly with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part. Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the Iranian-backed Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq militia, and many other senior militia leaders were among the demonstrators. On Monday, Iran condemned the US strikes as “terrorism”. Russia complained it had not been given advance warning. Street protests take place regularly in the Iraqi capital. In recent months, security guards have shot dead more than 450 people protesting against rampant government corruption and the growing influence of Iranian-backed groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah."
"A magnitude-5.1 earthquake has struck near Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant on Friday, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes."
"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said. The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic. The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”"
"The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.

"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family’s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian café, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again. Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed. Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously – threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future. Temperatures also reached record highs in Australia, triggering continent-wide bushfires, while in Africa, the Victoria Falls – one of the planet’s greatest cascades of water – dried to a trickle in 2019. The Glasgow talks will take place against this grim, ecological background. Robin McKie Three to watch Greta Thunberg Can the activist maintain the momentum of the climate protest movement? Donald Trump He is pulling the US out of international climate agreements by 4 November, 2020. But if he loses next year’s presidential election, on 3 November, and a Democrat wins, the US would rejoin talks in 2021. Claire Perry O’Neill As president of COP26, it will be the principal job of the former Tory MP to ensure the talks are successful. Politics The UK’s membership of the European Union will be terminated at the end of January, but that’s not Brexit done. We then enter a transition period while there are tough and complex negotiations about the future relationship with our closest neighbours and most important trading partners. Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters. There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020. The SNP will demand it, but without any real conviction that it can get one from a Conservative government that has set an adamantine face against the idea. This refusal will suit the Nationalists. Current polling suggests that they can’t be confident of winning a referendum now, and a second defeat would surely kill their ambition for a long time. The SNP’s true aim is to stoke Scottish resentment against Westminster to pave the way for a big win in the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That’s the year with the potential for a constitutional car crash that rips apart the kingdom. Both the Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the latter contest, which is expected to climax around March. Expect bitter rows about the election process as the Corbynites who control the party’s national executive committee try to fix the terms of the battle to favour their continuity candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey. Labour moderates are already saying that the succession of a beardless variation of Jeremy Corbyn will doom Labour to another decade in opposition. If that happens, the moderates will be asking whether the party is dead to them and they should try something different. Andrew Rawnsley Three to watch Boris Johnson He has made numerous promises about Brexit, the NHS and investment in the north. Can he stick to his pledges or will the wheels start to come off his premiership in 2020? Nicola Sturgeon Following a resounding victory in Scotland in the December 2019 general election, all eyes will be on the leader of the SNP in the year ahead to see how she manages to capitalise on her popularity in her push for Scottish independence. Rebecca Long Bailey She has a tough battle ahead against increasing numbers of candidates for the Labour party leadership. Will the members come out for the natural successor to Corbyn or will they want something new for the party? Arts Viewers eager to enter the dark world of Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat’s Dracula (BBC One, New Year’s Day), should also look out for the third season of the murky and mysterious Babylon Berlin, the most expensive non-English-language show ever made. Set in chaotic Weimar Germany, with subtitles, it is thrilling and scary and out on Sky 1 on 24 January. Closer to home, there is more stylish, existential angst, this time with a comic twist, on offer when the acclaimed BBC Two series Inside Number 9, from Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton returns in February. Theatrical novelties waiting in the wings include the first stage production of Angela Carter’s The Company of Wolves in May at the New Vic in Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire and a revival of Alan Bennett’s much-loved Talking Heads at the Watford Palace Theatre in Watford, courtesy of Dead Ringers’ Jan Ravens and co-star Julia Watson. And the enduring Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical, Carousel, is to spin into London’s open-air venue, Regent’s Park Theatre, in the summer. Celebrations of Beethoven’s 250th birthday will kick off with Sir Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra performing the seventh symphony on 15 January, and his opera Fidelio will be staged at Covent Garden in March, starring the German tenor Jonas Kaufmann as Florestan. Among art exhibitions, previously unseen work is promised at Gauguin and the Impressionists at the Royal Academy from the end of March, with paintings from Pissarro, Monet, Manet and Degas. Over at the British Museum, a new show Living with art: Picasso to Celmins starts in January, before a national tour, and will feature works given to the museum by the late film critic Alexander Walker. Highlights will include Jungle Boy, an early etching by David Hockney. In the cinema, the British year gets off to a good start with Sam Mendes’ 1917 and Armando Iannucci’s The Personal History of David Copperfield, both out in January, but the new Bond, No Time to Die, is now not being released until April. Smaller budget productions to look out for include Rose Glass’s acclaimed horror debut Saint Maud, starring Morfydd Clark, and the film of Florian Zeller’s stage hit The Father, which premieres at the Sundance film festival in January. Vanessa Thorpe Three to watch Johnny Flynn Already familiar to fans of the 2018 TV series of Les Miserables and Vanity Fair, the actor will have a big year. He appears as Bowie in Stardust and as a blond (shock) Knightley in a film of Jane Austen’s Emma, alongside Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart. Another Brit film The Dig, about an archaeologist, is also due to put him up on the big screen soon. Nicky Morgan The reappointed culture secretary, now operating from the elevated calm of the House of Lords, will receive pleas from all manner of cash-starved arts schemes, venues and institutes. Will she stay in the job for the long term, and, if so, will she listen? Adele Rumours about the release date for her putative fourth album (30?) are likely to reach fever pitch after a turbulent few years out of the limelight. Royals After a stormy year, the royal family face a challenging 2020 to steady the good ship Monarchy. The Queen, who will be 94 in April, looks increasingly alone as the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 99 in June, leads a near solitary life on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew’s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein’s alleged victims’ lawyers’ relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, meanwhile, are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold and risky strategy in taking on the press over privacy. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter to her estranged father. Harry has launched legal proceedings against the owners of the Sun and the Daily Mirror in relation to alleged phone hacking. The couple escaped to Canada for six weeks in November after Meghan told ITV’s Tom Bradby of the strain she felt she was under in the media spotlight. They launch their own foundation in 2020, after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, so all eyes will be on how they will carve out their future royal roles. Caroline Davies Three to watch Prince Charles Expect him to undertake more of the Queen’s public duties. Prince William A successful visit to Pakistan with the Duchess of Cambridge this year could lead to more roles as a statesman as he prepares to succeed his father as Prince of Wales. Baby Archie First we saw a forehead and nose, then a foot, and a couple of months later, a face. But the full Archie wasn’t revealed by the Sussexes until they introduced him to Desmond Tutu in South Africa in September. Royal fans are still waiting for his first UK appearance."
"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy. In his interview, Carney urged climate change deniers to drop their opposition on the issue, saying: “We can’t afford on this one to have selective information, spin, misdirection.” One such sceptic is the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore, who guest-edited Today on Saturday and included in his programme a feature questioning the global consensus on the climate crisis. Complaining about how much internal opposition there had been to this item being included, Moore accused the BBC of “climate change alarmism”."
"A man who was shot dead in central Moscow after opening fire on the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s main intelligence agency building, in an attack that killed two has been identified as a gun enthusiast. Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper. The motive for the attack remains unclear, although Kommersant, a daily newspaper, reported that witnesses told investigators he was shouting slogans “typical of Islamic State”. “I noticed he had been somewhat agitated lately,” Baza, a media outlet with links to the security services, cited his mother as saying. She said he was unmarried, with no children or close friends, and that he was passionate about guns. He appears to have had no social media presence. The assault on the FSB office took place shortly after Putin’s annual press conference in Moscow. The president was attending a gala concert at the nearby Kremlin in honour of the security services during the shootout. The attack may have been planned to coincide with the speech, an FSB source told Reuters. Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process."
"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries. A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration. It will be run by his confidante Susanne Raab, who worked on the country’s 2017 ban on full-face veils and a 2015 law designed to curb “political Islam”. The Green party will aim to exercise the most influence through a boosted ministry for infrastructure, transport and environment, expected to be headed by the former climate activist Leonore Gewessler. Green politicians in charge of the justice and culture portfolios will hope to curb the more authoritarian tendencies of Kurz’s ÖVP. In the final stretch of negotiations, Austria’s constitutional court ruled that some of the policies proposed by the conservatives – such as expanded surveillance measures or making social benefits conditional on command of the German language – would violate the constitution. “The Greens’ main aim [during coalition talks] has been to get major concessions on protecting the climate,” said Der Standard newspaper, commenting that the deal with the conservatives was as likely to please environmentalists as to frustrate leftwingers in the party. “With everything else, damage limitation will have to do.”"
"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes. CGT union workers also voted to halt production at Total’s Grandpuits refinery. Emmanuel Lepine, the secretary general of the CGT’s oil branch, told France Info radio that CGT workers at other refineries in France could also vote to halt production. “We gave an ultimatum to the government, it didn’t listen, so we’re doing exactly what we promised,” Lepine said. “What we are demanding is the withdrawal of the reform.” State officials have begun preparing for another round of union negotiations in the coming weeks before a further national day of protests on 9 January. The government has insisted it will push ahead with attempts to unify the French pension system, arguing that removing 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Opéra de Paris staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any age-related changes. Unions are angry at government plans to introduce a “pivot age” – keeping the legal retirement age at 62 but insisting on an additional two years of work to receive a full pension."
"As the world ushers in 2021, many will be looking forward to putting 2020 behind them. From a cocktail-making contest to a MasterChef-inspired cook-off, the Guardian spoke to four people about their plans for New Year’s Eve. ‘I think he’s making a daiquiri but he’s not very good’ “I’ll be making a raspberry mojito,” said Elinor, speaking of the cocktail-making contest she and her partner, Richard, both 32, have planned for Thursday night. “I think he’s making a daiquiri, but he’s not very good,” she added. Elinor, who works as an engineer in Glasgow, said the idea came to them as they drew suggestions from a hat. Both of them will also be attending an organised online murder mystery event. “We’ve done one before and they work quite well – you go into Zoom rooms to be questioned then come back together and watch the scenes play out,” she said. “In Scotland we have a tradition to ‘first foot’, which means being someone’s first visitor after midnight – normally bearing gifts such as shortbread and whisky. You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick. It’s horrifying at the moment.” ‘We’ve got to be optimistic’ In Preston, Janet and her husband, now both retired, have got together with neighbours every year for the last 18 years for a Christmas party. Coronavirus has prevented them celebrating this year but they are determined to see in 2021 together. In their cul-de-sac, people from five houses are planning to take fire pits and patios – and their drink of choice – to their front gardens at 11.30pm for a safe, socially distanced party. “If all we can do is toast each other and shout across the road, that’s what we’re going to do.” said Janet. “I will bring champagne and my husband will have a glass of red wine.” Janet’s family has been affected by coronavirus during the past year and though her brother recovered from the virus, another relative died. However, she believes it’s important to celebrate what you can. “I just hope everyone else can have a good time in a small way. It’s making the best of what you’ve got and who you’ve got around you. I think we’ve got to be optimistic.” ‘We need to appreciate what we have’ In London, Hasan Kilani, who is studying for a master’s in transnational queer feminist politics at Soas, is planning a long quiz night with friends on Zoom. “I moved here from Jordan in October and for tonight I’m preparing some questions related to British-Jordanian relations in pop culture,” said the 31-year-old. “Did you know that in 2019 Coldplay chose to release their album in Jordan?” Kilani and his partner are slightly concerned the internet may crash as others plan similar New Year’s Eve events. “I feel the entire world might be doing the same thing,” he said. “We have our own champagne, disco lights, and music playlist so we’ll have our own party and countdown if that happens. “I’m an Arab Muslim so I normally spend this time of year travelling outside Jordan. It’s been a bit disappointing since I arrived in the UK as you always hear that London has a lot of cultural things to offer, but I’ve not been able to experience that yet. I hope next year I’ll be able to see more of the city and that people will be nicer to each other and less toxic. We need to appreciate what we have.” ‘On balance he may be a better cook than me’ Helen, 29, who works in marketing in London said she was “really gunning to win” the MasterChef cook-off she has been preparing for against her boyfriend, Rory, 26. “We’ve been watching the show a lot and started to enjoy cooking more due to lockdown,” she said. While preparing her meal, Helen said she planned on taking the crown by cooking Japanese pickles, gyoza, spicy fried chicken and sushi “if I get time”. “We’ve been at this all day,” she said. “He’s a very, very good cook and on balance may be a better one than me. He’s a recruiter so he’s definitely competitive. “We would probably be with friends normally but not necessarily out as it can be a bit mad on New Year’s Eve. I think there’s light at the end of the tunnel now with the vaccines and that’s what we’ve all got to focus on. The main thing is everyone staying safe, well and at home. Hopefully the new year will bring a bit of normality.”"
"In Sydney the fireworks soared into the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour below was empty. In New York, Times Square was mostly deserted. No light show illuminated Beijing from the top of the TV tower. With revelry around the world curtailed by lockdowns and curfews imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19, the lions of London’s Trafalgar Square were barricaded off, and there were no crowds in St Peter’s Square and no one diving into the Tiber in Rome. This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget – one that has seen more than 1.7 million people killed and 82 million infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, whose pyrotechnic display has in the past drawn crowds of a million people to the city’s harbour area, rang in 2021 with a shortened display, with most popular observation spots fenced off and a heavy police presence deterring visitors. Only people who had restaurant reservations or were one of five guests of an inner-city resident were allowed in. “What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands gathered at popular spots across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but were not particularly worried. In New Zealand, too, which has managed to eliminate coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year’s Eve plans proceeded as usual. In Germany, however, where the sale of fireworks has been banned to discourage crowds and authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”, Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final new year’s address as chancellor that she had never found the old year so heavy. “And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope,” said Merkel, a trained physicist who won praise for taming the first virus wave but has drawn criticism for soaring infection and death numbers in the second. She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve. Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility. In New York, the New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway but in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said."
"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants. Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun. Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, the president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said the number of callers asking for veterinary assistance had grown since March. Patitta Traiwet, the president of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has branches across Thailand, said she had managed to maintain the animals’ routine but the elephants had noticed the absence of tourists lining up to give them bananas and pineapples. “They were confused at the beginning – where are the people? Why is nobody feeding me banana?” she said. Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth. Many people now hope that even when the tourists return, these elephants will remain resettled in their natural habitat for good. Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol"
"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage. “Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death. But a higher rate of transmissibility without strict controls could still lead to more death. • This article was corrected on 30 December 2020. The higher viral load was found in respiratory samples, not blood samples as an earlier version stated."
"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday. A senior manager at the trust, which now has 424 inpatients with Covid, said: “London Gold call has indicated that this position is expected to escalate for the next two weeks with 4 January potentially the zenith of critical care capacity needed.” The Independent Sage committee of scientific and medical experts is urging ministers to instigate an immediate further UK-wide lockdown to try to prevent an imminent “catastrophe”. Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action. Referring to the Tiers review, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: “It will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people to the highest level.” A toughening is needed urgently because pressures on the NHS in some places is “rising at an unsustainable rate”, she said. Keir Starmer sounded a stark warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian that the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January. Dr Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS and president of the HCSA, said ICU staff may end up having to in effect ration who received care that could help them survive. “Our NHS just doesn’t have the beds to cope. Some areas will be overwhelmed in days. If ventilation capacity is exceeded, horrendous choices will have to be made over those who live and die. “The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days. The organisation’s president, Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, said: “The NHS in the south-east is in meltdown. ICUs in the south-east are overflowing, with doctors telling us that their hospitals are running out of non-invasive ventilators and even basics like oxygen.” Richard Mitchell, chief executive of the Sherwood Forest group of hospitals in Nottinghamshire, tweeted that: “Today will be a difficult day, tomorrow may be tougher and the next couple of weeks are likely to be the busiest and most challenging we have ever faced in the NHS.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “There is no shortage of ventilators and we have enough oxygen to meet demand. “Throughout this global pandemic we have done whatever it takes to protect the NHS and save lives, including ensuring everyone who needed a ventilator had access to one.”"
"Throughout the pandemic, technology has been saving our jobs and our sanity – but in Barcelona the lockdowns have led to the revival of one of humanity’s simplest and most enduring inventions: the book. The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango. Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said."
"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said. In his new year address on Thursday, Macron vowed to avoid “unjustifiable delays” to vaccinations but also struck a defensive note, saying he would let “no one play with the safety” of the campaign. Axel Kahn, a leading geneticist and head of the National League Against Cancer, told Europe 1 radio that France’s vaccine strategy was wrong. “It is not suited to a situation that is so dangerous,” he said. Philippe Juvin, head of the casualty ward at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. “As an individual, I would like to be vaccinated to set an example and show people that we don’t die from the vaccine, we die from Covid. And when we don’t die, we can get severe forms of it that are very disabling,” Juvin told CNews television. Opposition leaders said the slowness of the vaccination programme made France the “dunce” of Europe. Damien Abad, leader of the centre-right opposition Les Républicains in the Assemblée Nationale, demanded an urgent meeting with the health minister. In a letter, other opposition critics wrote: “Mass vaccination is the ultimate means of seeing our country emerge from the damaging economic situation caused by the health crisis. Yet France is vaccinating 10,000 times slower than the UK.” They added: “France cannot be one of the last countries to get vaccinated and yet that’s the picture we’re facing today.” Alain Fischer, the government official overseeing France’s vaccination programme, told Europe 1 the country had chosen to prioritise the elderly and vulnerable, as opposed to health professionals, as in other countries. “There is no good or bad choice … These are small details that will seem ridiculous in two or three months,” he said. Critics say this hesitation is feeding conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxer sentiment. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, said the scientific data was clear. “The vaccine is safe and efficient. Like many of my colleagues, I think we should be giving the vaccines quicker in order to control the epidemic more rapidly. At the rate we’re going, we’ll still be in lockdown in 2022,” he tweeted. France reported 26,457 new confirmed cases on Wednesday in 24 hours, but attributed the rise to increased testing. There were 304 deaths in hospital. The number of positive tests remains low, at 2.9%."
"Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal. They interact with themselves, they forage naturally, they spend more time grooming each other, there’s less aggression between the macaques,” said Pizarro. “So there is a lot of positive spin from decreased human contact.”"
"Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy analyst who served three decades in prison for leaking thousands of classified documents to Israel, has arrived in Tel Aviv after being released from parole. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”. The couple are expected to enter several days of quarantine, which is compulsory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of coronavirus."
"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that it would be glad to meet the letter’s signatories to discuss reforms. “We know that as a sector we can and must do better,” said chief executive Kate Henderson. “Last month we launched our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Insight report, which provided evidence of the change we need to deliver. “This, and our new code of governance, emphasise the importance of housing association boards and staff reflecting the diversity of the communities they serve and ensuring the sector is always working to strengthen relationships with residents.”"
"The ruthless campaign by the Chinese government to extinguish all memories of the massacre at Tiananmen Square has now resulted in the removal of the sculpture from the campus of the University of Hong Kong (Outcry as memorial to Tiananmen Square victims removed from Hong Kong University, 23 December). Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him. No doubt the chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten – who was the last British governor of Hong Kong – will be sympathetic. There is also plenty of space for the erection of a memorial near the Chinese embassy in central London.

"Confused anti-vaccine protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre, where they were filmed shouting abuse at staff and appearing to steal equipment. Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs. The local Tory MP Ben Everitt described the protesters as “dickheads” and urged anyone with information to contact police. Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow secretary of state for international trade, described the protest as “dreadful”, at a site where “NHS staff are working over the festive season to help others”. He urged anyone with information to pass this on to Thames Valley police. Former health secretary Matt Hancock criticised the activists’ “appalling behaviour”. The Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, Alicia Kearns, described the scenes as “shameful, self-aggrandising nonsense”. Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said the group’s actions were “totally unacceptable”. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scenes were “disgraceful”. “For months now we have been warning need legislation to tackle those who harass others seeking healthcare. Government promised to act weeks ago but nothing as yet. Enough. It’s not free speech when 50% of debate in fear,” she said. Matthew Barber, police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, said it was “appalling” to see the protest “escalate into something much uglier”. He added that he had spoken to Thames Valley police officers to discuss the police response on Wednesday evening, and said that “criminal offences will be investigated and appropriate action taken”. “All of the events of today will be reviewed to help plan for future protest events and ensure that colleagues in the NHS can continue their fantastic work in delivering the vaccine rollout,” he said. Joe Harrison, CEO of Milton Keynes University hospital, said: “I am very sorry and angry to see NHS colleagues at Milton Keynes Covid testing centre harassed and intimidated at their place of work. “Our staff having to deal with increasing aggression and violence for simply doing their job. It’s abhorrent, unacceptable and we will not stand for it.”"
"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers. The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed"
"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf. Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence. A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister. Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine. Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world. Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision. The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September. But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022. This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought. The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars. China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind."
"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails. “If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers. The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”"
"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban]. Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue. They erased us.” Khalilzad said in his own interview with the Today programme that the collapse of the republic was due to a “failure of Afghan leadership” and Afghan troops that did not “resist hard” against the Taliban. Six months ago the two men were among the most influential figures shaping Afghanistan’s future; now neither are willing to accept any responsibility for the tragedy stalking the country. Carter asked the former president about any personal regrets that had surfaced in the last 100 days. Ghani did not mention the humanitarian crisis, but he lamented the damage to his reputation and legacy. “My work has been destroyed. My values have been trampled on, and I’ve been made a scapegoat.”"
"Thousands of South Africans will pause to remember the anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90, every day this week as bells are rung at churches across the country for 10 minutes at noon. Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country. He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo. Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party. Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer. In one of his last this year, he emerged from hospital in a wheelchair to get a Covid-19 vaccine, waving but not offering comment. The archbishop had been in a weakened state for several months and died peacefully at 7am (0500 GMT) on Sunday, according to several of his relatives. The Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu “an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.”"
"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation. In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”"
"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure. “There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”"
"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open. Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10, even as the number of new infections hit record highs, after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”. On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors. It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events. Lauterbach said the rules may have to be toughened further, as existing measures “will not be enough to prevent a significant rise in Omicron cases”. In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated."
"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city. Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory. Since the start of the war, a number of military targets, including oil and weapon depots have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks inside Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as payback. Also on Tuesday, Putin concluded his two-day “informal summit” in St Petersburg with the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a Moscow-led group consisting of former Soviet states, by gifting the eight leaders present gold rings. The meeting came on the back of growing unease between the Russian president and the rest of the CIS bloc, as nations have sought to distance themselves from Moscow’s faltering war."
"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce. In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, argued that requiring Covid tests for all passengers from China was “only effective if it is taken at the European level”, noting that many people arrive in Italy on connecting flights through other European countries. After an announcement made by Italy’s health ministry on Thursday, travellers from China are obliged to show a negative test result upon embarking on their flight and to take a second antigen test upon their arrival."
"Brazil has been gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepared to both welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons. Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration. That terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia, and the weekend is set to be both tense and festive – but whatever happens could be overshadowed by the following day’s events. Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides. The former athlete of the century will be laid to rest at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies that claims to be the tallest in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a space on the ninth floor of the building almost two decades ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out. Pelé is loved by people here and by fans of the club because he projected the name of Santos all over the world.”"
"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute. “Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn. The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”. Zero-Covid restrictions and the near collapse of the property development sector punished China’s economy this year. To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone. A faltering economy could further provoke domestic frustrations, which peaked in 2022 over the impact of Xi’s signature hardline zero-Covid policy. For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled. With no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel restrictions or mass testing, Covid cases have soared across China. Mass fatalities are predicted, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus. On Monday, in his first remarks on Covid since the shift in policy, Xi urged officials to take steps to “feasibly protect people’s lives” and said: “We should launch the patriotic health campaign in a more targeted way ... fortify a community line of defence for epidemic prevention and control, and feasibly protect people’s lives, safety and health.” Trivium says what happens next with Covid and Covid policy is “the most important question” politically and economically, for China and Xi in 2023: “It’s not at all clear how this plays out.” The past year has brought far more for China than Xi would have hoped, or analysts expected. Tsang says that, in the end, events have still largely worked out for Xi, even if protests took the shine off his leadership. “He mostly got what he wanted, including not just a third term as top leader but also a leadership filled by his supporters,” says Tsang. “It is less clear that it was equally good for China, as Xi’s amassing of near dictatorial power is costing China dearly.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin"
"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems. As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up. But it also makes sense that the real humans who are behind censorship can see for themselves that current Covid management is all over the place,” he said. “They must be asking themselves how they could possibly censor Covid-related posts when everyone has Covid.”"
"Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year amid mounting military tensions with China, the island’s president has announced. Under the plans due to come into effect in 2024, conscripts will undergo more intense training, including shooting exercises and combat instruction used by US forces. Conscripts will be tasked with guarding key infrastructure, enabling regular forces to respond more swiftly in the event of any attempt by China to invade. The announcement of the change came after Taiwan’s defence ministry reported that 71 Chinese air force jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone within 24 hours on Monday – the largest reported incursion to date. “As long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,” President Tsai Ing-wen told a news conference after a national security council meeting. “Taiwan wants to tell the world that between democracy and dictatorship, we firmly believe in democracy. Between war and peace, we insist on peace. Let us show the courage and determination to protect our homeland and defend democracy.” The defence authority also plans to raise the monthly wage of regular conscription soldiers from about NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), almost in line with the minimum wage. Since 2013, Taiwan has required men over 18 to serve four months in the military, with the first five weeks in a basic training boot camp. The new plan will put mandatory recruits on eight-week basic training. Chen Chi-mai, mayor of Kaohsiung city and the acting chairperson of the ruling Democratic Progressive party, told reporters on Tuesday that it was essential to strengthen national security, the official news agency CNA reported. Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China’s growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence. Tsai said “a few things” had been learned from that war which have been incorporated into Taiwan’s defence reforms, and noted that Ukraine’s ability to hold off much larger Russian forces had given the international community time to render assistance. Previous governments cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to four months to please younger voters during a period of easing tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan’s efforts to bolster the readiness of its defence forces accelerated after the visit to the island from the US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August. China immediately staged military drills around Taiwan in response to Pelosi’s visit. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan welcomed the announcement on conscription reform. “The United States’ commitment to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defence capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,” the American Institute in Taiwan said. A survey conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December found that 73.2% of respondents were in favour of an extension to compulsory service. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the Chinese military threat was “getting more serious than ever”, with a five-fold increase in warplane incursions into the island’s defence zone since 2020. Wu said the drills conducted after Pelosi’s visit were also aimed at scaring off other governments which might support Taiwan. As part of the efforts to ramp up the island’s combat strength, on Friday Tsai inaugurated new military facilities at an army base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, which she said offers “a better living environment” for military personnel, according to a statement released by the president office.

"Kherson city was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November. But for some, the horrors of the Russian occupation are still not over. Nadia* sent her 14-year-old son to a Russian-run summer camp in Crimea – occupied by Moscow since 2014 – in October. He was meant to return after two weeks. It has now been more than two months. In late November, he forwarded her a series of chilling voice messages from his camp leader telling him he would not be allowed back to Kherson because of his pro-Ukraine views. “You are in Russia! You shouldn’t be doing different [types] of weird bullshit,” the camp leader in Yevpatoria, Crimea, said in the voice messages, which have been forwarded to the Guardian. “I don’t know who is going to deal with you now, but you are not going back to Kherson, that’s 100% [certain] … You can thank your mother for that.” Like many parents, Nadia did not see sending her child to such a camp – known as summer camps even at other times of year – as making a pro-Russia statement. Parents often decided to send their children because their classmates were going and they were being offered a free holiday by the sea. Nadia’s son left Kherson on 4 October and his stay at the camp was repeatedly extended by the authorities, said his mother, speaking from central Kherson after Russian forces left the city. At first, the camp leaders told her that this was for safety reasons and then, after Ukrainian forces had entered Kherson city, they said he could not return because the city was now “occupied” by Ukraine. In the messages, the camp leader outlined his problem with the boy. Firstly, his Telegram profile picture featured a Ukrainian trident, Ukraine’s national symbol, on the wall in the background. Secondly, his mother had said she wanted her son to return to Ukraine, signifying that she saw Kherson city as part of Ukraine, not Russia, thereby going against the grain of Russian propaganda that still insists the city is part of Russia. Nadia’s case is one of many. Hundreds of Ukrainian children as young as six and as old as 16 from Kherson and Kharkiv regions have been stuck in Russian summer camps for weeks and in some cases months. Over the summer, Russia offered parents in the occupied areas of Ukraine a chance to send their children to summer camps in Crimea and southern Russia for free. But it has been refusing to return the children to their parents, citing the ongoing fighting as well as Ukraine’s “occupation” of areas Russia claimed to have annexed and has now retreated from. Parents are told they can collect the children if they come in person, which requires them to cross the dangerous unofficial checkpoint through the frontline or leave Ukraine and travel via Poland and the Baltics. But many of the parents are from very low-income backgrounds and have not been able to make the journey. Though the parents sent them willingly, they had agreed to a short stint. The UN convention on children’s rights bans the “illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad”, so Russia is obliged to return the children. The Guardian spoke to eight parents who had sent their children to the summer camps. Some say they believe that Russia wants to use the children to exchange for Russian prisoners of war. Others believe Moscow wants to assimilate the children and plan to keep them in Russia. The camps were advertised through schools in the occupied areas as restorative breaks, offering a mix of sports, arts, games, and sea air or lake swimming. But the children have also been taught Russian narratives about the invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Soviet history as well as Russian culture, according to several interviewed and videos posted online. In one video, hundreds of children can be seen in a school playground in Crimea singing the Russian national anthem. Most appear not to know the words. The hundreds of children stuck in the Russian-run summer camps are in addition to the thousands of children living in orphanages in the occupied areas who were illegally taken to Russia during the Russian occupation. Ukraine’s human right’s ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, has said this is part of Russia’s “genocide against Ukraine”, erasing Ukrainian identity through “re-educating the future generations”. Lubinets said the Russians were not interested in returning the children, and though Ukraine was trying, “the return of each child is like a special operation”. Ukraine asks parents not to publicly name their children as they then become harder to exchange. For a domestic audience, Russia portrays the deportation of the children as an attempt to save Ukrainian children from the war – ignoring Russia’s role in starting the conflict. Since October, the children have started attending Russian schools while living on the camps’ premises. It is not clear what plans Russia has for these children beyond this school term. One of them is Natalia’s* 12-year-old daughter, who left her home in Balakliia in late August and is still in southern Russia, attending a school in Krasnodar by bus. Natalia has managed to keep in daily contact with her but cannot afford to make the journey to collect her. “I think it’s some sort of blackmail,” said Natalia. “I think they want to use them as bargaining chips.” In at least some cases, the Russian camp leaders have said they do not plan to send the children back. In other cases, children have been moved from one camp to another without the parents being informed. Ivana*, a mother from Kherson region, made the long journey to collect her daughter from a camp in Crimea, only to be told the child was not there any more and had been moved to a camp in the Republic of Adygea. She then made a second long trip, where eventually she found her. * * * Exactly how many Ukrainian children remain in Russian hands is very difficult to tell. In mid-October, Russia’s state news agency Tass said there were about 4,500 children from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Crimean summer camps. Natalia said at least 100 of those who travelled with her daughter were still there. Recent videos taken from some of the five camps in Crimea hosting children from Kherson indicate that at least several hundred children are still there. Part of the issue is that many of the parents refuse to come forward to the Ukrainian authorities. Dmytro*, who managed to get his son back by threatening a teacher into putting him on a bus in early October, said parents he knew feared being labelled as collaborators or supporters of Russia. They were trying to resolve things on their own, he said, without official help. An adviser to the new Kherson regional authorities on missing people, Volodymyr Zhdanov, questioned how the parents “could give their children to the occupiers”, though he admitted it was a grey area and the full picture was unclear. “We are hearing a lot of stories through the grapevine [of children stuck in Crimea],” said Zhdanov, who noted that the gathering of information on what had happened in occupied Kherson was only just beginning. “But the police say parents have not come forward.” Andrii Kovanyi, a spokesperson for Kherson police, said they could not comment on the matter as it was being dealt with by several bodies. Most parents and children who attended the camps said the conditions were good. Children were given the equivalent of hotel rooms to share, taken to see dolphins, to museums and to the beach. The Russian-appointed authorities in Crimea claim to have spent 1.2bn rubles (£16.4m) in 2022 on the camps, which were also attended by Russian children. The idea behind the camps appears to be to demonstrate the best of Russia and to integrate the children into their new state. In interviews, the adults in charge portray themselves and others as saving children who are victims of the war as well as the Ukrainian state. In videos from the children’s camps posted on the Russian-installed Kherson authority’s social media, children can be seen with the Russian flag, singing the Russian national anthem as well as classic Soviet songs. A nine-year-old girl in Kherson city, whose mother collected her in October, said that as well as games and sports they had lectures “about the war”. One history teacher from Kherson, Maksym Ivchenko, who like many other teachers accompanied the children to Crimea, was asked by Russia’s Crimea24 TV to explain how the history curriculum in Russia differed from that of Ukraine. “The most egregious thing was the reversal of modern history. We’re talking first of all about the great patriotic war [the second world war], what happened in the Soviet period, its collapse and everything up until the present day,” Ivchenko said. Tatiana Makarova, the head of the programme for Kherson and Zaporizhzhia at one the biggest camps in Crimea, Artek, told the same TV channel: “Our task is to remove the psychological pressure put on the children who come from the areas where the war is happening.” Nadia said she and her son had argued at first because she did not want him to go to the camp, but eventually she gave in. “I thought: OK, it’s two weeks, there’s the seaside, he’ll get a rest and come back.” * Names have been changed"
"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has secured the release of 1,456 prisoners of war since Russia invaded in February, according to Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president was speaking in an annual address to the Ukrainian parliament, where Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats, military personnel and family members of fallen soldiers were reportedly present. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. A Crimean human rights activist has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Moscow-installed court in the Russian-annexed peninsula found her guilty of carrying an explosive device, in a trial rights activists have described as “trumped-up” and “illegal”. Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher”, it added. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war live blog today. Thank you for reading. The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, Kyrylo Budanov, made a visit to Bakhmut on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet special forces detachments working at the front and to distribute medals, according to a statement released by the service. Russian strikes have continued in the recently liberated city of Kherson, launching attacks against the city on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to Ukrainian military, 33 strikes were launched in the past 24 hours. One of the targets included a maternity ward in a hospital in the city. Footage shows the aftermath of the strike where windows were shattered and staff and patients were forced to take cover in the basement. One staff member told reporters: I don’t even want to think about [what could have happened]’ after surgeons were in theatre just 30 minutes earlier. The secret to Igor Pedin’s survival had been his invisibility, the 61-year-old had said. With his dog, Zhu-Zhu, the former ship’s cook banked on being ignored by the trigger-happy Russian soldiers and their killing machines when he took the first step of a 140-mile journey from his home in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on 23 April, before stealing out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories towards the relative safety in the city of Zaporizhzhia. Such were the risks that soldiers at one checkpoint had beseeched Pedin to turn back but then stuffed cigarettes in his pockets for good luck. He did survive, against the odds, but the remarkable story has made Pedin more visible than he could ever have imagined. Read the full story here: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Kherson city council member, Dmytro Poddubniy, told CNN: I’m telling these people that Kherson is one of the most dangerous cities right now. So I ask them to imagine that they are going on vacation for a couple of weeks. It may be easier for them to decide to move this way. But still, a lot of people are staying in the city. One Kherson resident, Inna Balyoha, told the news channel she was afraid her elderly and sick mother would not be able to endure the journey. She said: She is very weak. She will not reach another city. Many remain in Kherson under shelling because of their parents. Authorities have urged Kherson residents to evacuate to safer regions as Russian shelling has become “more and more frequent and large-scale”. A Crimean human rights activist has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Moscow-installed court in the Russian-annexed peninsula found her guilty of carrying an explosive device, in a trial rights activists have described as “trumped-up” and “illegal”. Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. The Crimean human rights activist, nurse and citizen journalist was detained by Russian authorities in late April while on her way from work. Her family told CNN at the time balaclava-clad officials from the Russian special police unit searched her house in the village of Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya, and took the family’s laptops and phones. Her case was part of a string of disappearances of activists, journalists and ordinary citizens reported over the last decade in Russian-occupied Crimea. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) called on Russian authorities in Crimea to disclose any information concerning Danilovich’s whereabouts when she first went missing. In a statement, Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator, said: Iryna Danilovich’s alarming disappearance prompts fears of yet another clampdown on independent reporting in Russian-occupied Crimea, which is already an extremely restrictive environment for the press. Russia’s security service (FSB) accused Danilovich of making an explosive device and keeping it on her person, IMI said. She was also fined 50,000 rubles (£570) on the charges of illegal storage and manufacture of explosives under Part 1 of Art. 222.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, it said. Volodymyr Chekryhin, deputy head of the Crimean Human Rights Group, said that the case against Danylovich was grossly falsified, starting with Russian FSB officers effectively kidnapping her. He said: The entire so-called ‘investigation’ against her was comprised of illegal methods: having been kidnapped, Iryna was kept in the basement of the FSB office and faced with various forms of pressure and intimidation, even torture – she was beaten and strangled. The “so-called trial completely deprived Iryna Danilovich of her right to a fair trial and was a cynical pageant”, he added. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the frontline city of Bakhmut in southern Ukraine. Ukraine has secured the release of 1,456 prisoners of war since Russia invaded in February, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Speaking in an annual address to the Ukrainian parliament, Zelenskiy also told lawmakers he had participated in 850 international events since the war began. Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a Ukrainian MP, wrote on his Telegram: Today, the parliament gathered for its last meeting of the year. The president’s address to the Verkhovna Rada about Ukraine’s internal and external situation was heard at the meeting. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats, military personnel and family members of fallen soldiers were also present at the closed-door parliamentary session, he added. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added. Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, said Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. One of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head of Russia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to a Russian-installed “official”. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. The mother of an Australian man from Victoria killed fighting in Ukraine has remembered her son as a defender of freedom who was driven by empathy. The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher”, it added. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The defence ministers of Russia, Turkey and Syria held talks in Moscow today, Russian state media reported. State-owned news agency Ria cited Russia’s defence ministry as saying: Ways of resolving the Syrian crisis and the problem of refugees as well as joint efforts to combat extremist groups in Syria have been discussed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a post on Telegram, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Zelenskiy said: Last year, 70,000 people lived there. Now only a few civilians are left there. There is no place that is not covered with blood. There is no hour when the terrible roar of artillery does not sound. Still, Bakhmut stands. Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of 70,000-80,000, is a ghost town now largely in ruins. The deterioration of diplomatic relations between Russia and Lithuania has continued, with the expulsion today of a Lithuanian from their embassy in Moscow. A statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: On 28 December, Chargé d’Affaires of Lithuania in Russia, Jurgita Cibulskiene was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Lithuanian side was strongly protested in connection with the unjustified expulsion on 1 December this year [of an] employee of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. As a response, one of the diplomats of the Lithuanian embassy was declared “persona non grata”, and must leave the territory of the Russian Federation within five days. Reuters reported that ship insurers have said they are cancelling war risk cover across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, after an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses. Reinsurers, which insure the insurers, typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on 1 January, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started. The moves by the insurers will make it harder for ship-owners or charterers to find insurance, increase prices and may mean some ships sail uninsured, industry sources said. Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, has tweeted images of a maternity hospital in Kherson city that was shelled by Russian forces yesterday. According to Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Two babies were born at the hospital the day of the attack, Liashko wrote on his Facebook, adding that one arrived just “minutes” before the shelling. He added: Fortunately, no babies ... no hospital staff were hurt this time. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. The European Commission says it is donating €14m (£12.3m) to buy and transport school buses for Ukraine, as well as an additional 120 buses “to bring Ukrainian children safely to school”. About 5.7 million school-age children in Ukraine have been affected by Russia’s war, which has also led to thousands of schools and educational facilities damaged or destroyed, the Commission said. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. The monument was first erected in 1900 but was dismantled in 1920 after the Bolshevik takeover. It was restored and reopened in 2007. After the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukraine’s parliament passed a “decommunisation” law that meant statues to Lenin and other Soviet political figures had to be removed (or, in the case of Odesa’s Lenin statue, reworked and reimagined as a statue to Darth Vader). Since Russia’s February invasion, however, many in Ukraine have sought a more overarching reevaluation of anything Russian, and the monument to Catherine had been daubed with red paint several times. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Authorities plan to store the monuments in a museum in the city. France’s armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has tweeted a photo of him visiting a memorial to the war dead in Kyiv as part of his visit to Ukraine. Lecornu, who is on his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May, is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army officials. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, has struck a cautious tone on whether his country would supply Ukraine with air defence systems. Speaking in an interview with Il Messaggero newspaper, Crosetto said the air defence systems, which Ukraine’s president has requested, would be provided to Kyiv “if possible”. He added: If we give air defence missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality. Crosetto’s comments came after Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke with Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Tuesday. In a tweet posted after the call, Ukraine’s leader said Meloni informed him that “the issue of providing air defence systems to protect Ukrainian skies is being considered”. A Swiss court has granted a six-month “stay of bankruptcy” to the company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was built to bring Russian gas to Germany but never opened after Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, a Swiss-based company owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom, built the gas pipeline but the project was halted in early February after Moscow formally recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. The company’s stay has now been extended to 10 July by a Swiss regional, Reuters cited a notice published in the Swiss official gazette of commerce as saying. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. The Russian Union of Lawyers head, Igor Trunov, told the state-owned news agency Tass the health ministry had agreed to his appeal to offer free cryobank services to the 300,000 soldiers conscripted in September. According to the lawyer, his organisation has already been contacted by several couples whose husbands will soon depart for Ukraine. The health ministry has not yet commented on Trunov’s remarks. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. Russia’s population has been in near-constant decline for decades. The coronavirus pandemic led to the country’s largest natural population decline since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The war in Ukraine, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of young Russian men while also sparking an unprecedented exodus of educated professionals, is expected to hasten the demographic crash for Russia. The independent demographer Alexei Raksha has described the current demographic situation as “the perfect storm”. Earlier we reported air raid alerts blared across Ukraine, including in Kyiv and Mykolaiv. Officials have sounded the all-clear almost two hours later. There were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes. Ukrainian social media suggested the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off. Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine, forcing hundreds of civilians to flee the recently liberated city amid relentless shelling by Moscow’s troops. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said this morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in the city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added. At least 10 people were killed and 58 were wounded by a Russian strike in Kherson on Saturday, authorities said. Russian forces were forced to withdraw from Kherson city last month, but its residents have faced relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnieper River. About 400 people have fled Kherson since Christmas Day, the BBC reported, after a sharp increase in the intensity of the Russian bombardment of the city. The Kremlin has dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, and insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account today’s realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia. Plans that do not take these realities into account cannot be peaceful. Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk – in September after holding Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions. Kyiv and its western allies have said they would never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine’s territory. President Zelenskiy has been promoting his 10-point peace plan, first announced in November, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskiy’s foreign minister, Dmtryo Kuleba, said on Monday that Ukraine was aiming to hold a peace summit by the end of February – preferably at the UN with its secretary general, António Guterres, as a possible mediator. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The Kyiv Post has reported that the French armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has arrived in Kyiv. It is his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May 2022. France24 reporter Andrew Hilliar has said Lecornu is expected to visit a memorial to the war dead today, and that the trip comes on the back of the promise by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to increase his nation’s military support for Ukraine. Hilliar reports that Lecornu is under pressure to announce further assistance, with some in Ukraine still angry at Macron’s comments during the course of the war, where he has seemed more vocal than most European leaders to suggest that Ukraine should be prepared to make concessions in return for peace. Reuters reports that one of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head ofRussia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed “official” in the occupied region. In a picture published by Rogov on Telegram, Kiriyenko was seen outside the plant. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has tweeted to reiterate the support the US is providing to keep energy systems running in Ukraine, following Russia’s sustained attacks on the energy infrastructure that civilians rely on. The ambassador said the embassy in Kyiv is “proud to carry out the secretary of state’s mission to work day and night with Ukrainian partners to help keep the energy grid up and running through the winter. We stand with Ukraine.” Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. Associated Press reports that in an interview with the minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian official said: The next stage, now that we are more or less equipped with reconnaissance drones, is strike drones. These are both exploding drones and drones that fly up to 3 to 10km and hit targets. I can say already that the situation regarding drones will change drastically in February or March. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. In the last few moments, authorities in Kyiv and Mykolaiv have declared air raid alerts, according to posts on Telegram. The state-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting that Russian authorities claim to have thwarted a Ukrainian-sponsored terrorist attack in Chegem in the Kabardino-Balkarian republic, which is near Russia’s border with Georgia. It reports: The federal security service stopped the activities of two previously convicted Russian citizens who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services, were preparing a terrorist act in the city of Chegem. After committing the crime, they planned to leave for Ukraine to take part in hostilities against the Russian armed forces. At the scene of the clash, they found an improvised explosive device with a capacity of about 2kg in TNT equivalent, an AK-74 assault rifle, a pistol and ammunition. The report states that the two suspects were killed. No evidence was offered for the claims of the Russian security services. Adeshola Ore and Amy Remeikis report for the Guardian: The mother of an Australian man from Victoria killed fighting in Ukraine has remembered her son as a defender of freedom who was driven by empathy. The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. His mother, in a statement released via Dfat, said her son had fallen in love with Ukraine and was “humbled by the kindness and hospitality within his new community”. “Sage died in action defending the freedom of the Ukrainian people,” she said. “Sage has always believed in defending country, people and the right for freedom.” She said her son upheld his values as he served in Australia and abroad in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and described her son as driven by “empathy for the Ukrainian people” at the “injustice that has taken place”. Sage’s mother was not named in the statement, but said her family was devastated by their loss and would remember Sage’s “humour, kind heart and laughter”. Read more here: Australian man who died fighting in Ukraine remembered as ‘defender of freedom’ Oleh Synyehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region that borders two of the areas in the east of Ukraine – Luhansk and Donetsk – which Russia has claimed to annex, has posted to Telegram to say one person has been wounded due to enemy action. He said: A 48-year-old man received a shrapnel wound as a result of the morning attacks of the occupiers on Kharkiv. He is in the hospital in a moderate condition. The claim has not been independently verified. An “official” channel of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) – one of the areas of Ukraine that Russia claimed to have annexed in September – has posted on Telegram to say in the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have fired at seven of the settlements the DPR claims as its territory. It says one civilian was injured, and two houses and three civilian infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia, Syria and North Korea were the only UN member states to recognise the DPR as any kind of legitimate authority before the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, declared it was territory of the Russian Federation. The European Union delegation to Ukraine has announced that it will support “more than 700,000 Ukrainians in the winter” during the war. In a press statement released on Wednesday, the office of the international organisation for migration (IOM) in Ukraine says it is “stepping up efforts to help internally displaced and war-affected people survive the cold weather”. The statement claims that: IOM’s winter preparedness support, made possible by EU funding, includes repairs to collective centres for displaced people, improvements to water, drainage and heating systems, repairs to damaged houses, and the provision of warm blankets, bedding, mattresses and hygiene items. The programme also provides solid fuel and cash assistance to help people have flexible winter livelihoods. This funding will also enable IOM to ensure the availability of critical assets to ensure that aid continues to reach war-affected populations, and to support partner organisations responding to urgent needs on the ground. Claudia Amaral, head of the European Commission’s directorate-general for civil protection and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, is quoted as saying: Vulnerable sections of the population of Ukraine are going through the hardest winter. As the attacks continue, leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating and water, our humanitarian partners, including IOM, continue to work to meet the most urgent needs. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv region in Ukraine’s west, has posted to Telegram to say that it was quiet overnight in the region. He said there was one air alert yesterday, a warning of cruise missiles being fired from Belarus in the north, but that the danger “did not materialise”. The official Telegram channel of the Kyiv city state administration has posted to say that there are air raid warnings in effect in Ukraine’s capital. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Russian forces have fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in the Ukrainian city of Kherson in the 24 hours to early Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said on Telegram. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says that fighting has intensified, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines. Russian troops who have been part of a mobilisation drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, the state TASS agency reported on Wednesday. Citing Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan. The ministry “determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilised to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024”, Trunov was quoted as saying. Families can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so. More on Russia’s response to the oil price cap, via Reuters: Under the cap, oil traders who want to retain access to Western financing for such crucial aspects of global shipping as insurance must promise not to pay above $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil. That is close to the current price for Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia was able to sell it for much of the past year, when windfall energy profits helped Moscow offset the impact of financial sanctions. The decree from Putin, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to “actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them”. The Kremlin ban would halt crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from 1 February to 1 July 2023. A separate ban on refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel would take effect on a date to be set by the government. Putin would have authority to overrule the measures in special cases. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and any actual disruption to its sales would have far-reaching consequences for global energy supplies. Russia retaliated on Tuesday against a price cap on its oil imposed by Western countries, while its forces were involved in heavy fighting around the bombed-out ghost town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Despite an intensification in the fighting the frontline in eastern Ukraine remains little changed, with neither side making any major advances, said Britain’s Ministry of Defence and Ukraine military analysts. Moscow will ban oil sales to countries that abide by the price cap that was imposed on 5 December, President Vladimir Putin decreed. The price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Moscow’s military efforts in Ukraine - without upsetting markets by actually blocking Russian supply. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The agency says the actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. The UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) says that since the start of the war, at least 6,884 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, including 429 children. However, the agency believes that the actual figures are “considerably higher”. We’ll have more on this story shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. Heavy fighting continues in the east and south of the country amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, Britain’s defence ministry said in its daily military briefing on Tuesday. Russia’s military has moved many of its warplanes from Engels airbase to other locations after strikes on the crucial airbase, according to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force. Three Russian servicemen were killed on Monday after a Ukrainian drone attack on the airbase, which lies deep inside Russian territory, according to Russia’s defence ministry. Putin’s comments that he was “ready to negotiate with all parties” involved in the conflict in Ukraine are part of a deliberate information campaign aimed at misleading the west into making concessions, according to analysts. The US thinktank Institute for the Study of War said the Russian president did not offer to negotiate with Ukraine on Saturday, contrary to some reporting. The bodies of 42 Ukrainian servicemen who died while fighting have been returned to Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. Work on bringing back the bodies of Ukraine’s fighters “does not stop for a day”, Oleh Kotenko, the commissioner for missing persons, said. Vladimir Putin met his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, twice in the past 24 hours to “finalise many issues”, Belarusian state-owned Belta news agency reported. The meetings took place in St Petersburg, over breakfast on Tuesday at the Russian Museum, as well as at an informal summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) yesterday evening, it reported. A Russian sausage tycoon who reportedly criticised the war in Ukraine has died after falling from the third-floor window of a luxury hotel in India. The body of Pavel Antov, 65, was discovered just two days after his friend and another local Russian politician, Vladimir Bidenov, was found dead in the same hotel after an apparent heart attack."
"Pope Benedict XVI, who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, died on Saturday aged 95, three days after his successor, Pope Francis, warned the world that he was gravely ill. The Vatican announced that Francis would preside at Benedict’s funeral in St Peter’s Square on Thursday. From Monday, his body will lie at St Peter’s Basilica to allow the faithful to pay respects. Benedict’s death brings to a close an unprecedented period in recent history where two popes have coexisted, a situation that has caused tensions within rival camps in the Vatican. It eases the way for his successor, Pope Francis, to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point – impossible while the outcome would have been three popes. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer paid warm tribute to Benedict, referring to his 2010 visit to the UK as a historic moment. Other world leaders including Ireland’s Michael D Higgins, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Germany’s Olaf Scholz also issued tributes. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, said he was a scholar, pastor and a man of God who would be remembered for “his courtesy, his gentleness, the perceptiveness of his mind and the openness of his welcome to everybody that he met”. Justin Welby, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, said Benedict was “one of the greatest theologians of his age”. Earlier this week, Pope Francis announced during his weekly audience that Benedict was “very sick” and asked for people to pray for him. Benedict, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Germany in 1927, was a deeply conservative pontiff, whose tenure was overshadowed by sexual abuse scandals in the church. He retired leaving a chequered reputation after a papacy that was at times divisive. The son of a policeman, he grew up in rural Bavaria and at the age of 14 joined the Hitler Youth, a requirement, and served in the German army in the second world war. Towards the end of the war, he deserted and was briefly held as a prisoner of war by US forces. He later became a major figure in the Vatican and, as Cardinal Ratzinger, served as a right-hand man to his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. He headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a Vatican department once known as the Inquisition, for 24 years, a position that earned him the nickname “God’s rottweiler”. During his tenure, allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up began to surface. His critics said he failed to grasp the gravity of the crimes and the scale of the crisis, which reached a peak several years after he was elected pope in April 2005. As well as the flood of allegations, lawsuits and official reports relating to sexual abuse and the priests’ complicity in covering it up, the Vatican was also rocked by the theft of confidential documents, many of which later appeared in an exposé of alleged corruption. In October 2012, a Vatican court convicted the pope’s personal butler, Paolo Gabriele, of stealing the papers. He told the trial he had been acting against “evil and corruption”. Benedict held uncompromising positions on homosexuality and contraception. He had strongly opposed liberation theology, a radical movement that began in South American in the 1960s and advocated clerical social activism among the poor and marginalised. His sudden resignation at the age of 85, in February 2013, the first pope to do so since the middle ages, left the church reeling. He said at the time that he did not have the strength to carry on as leader of the world’s estimated 1.2 billion Catholics. “I have had to recognise my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me,” he said. He took the title of Pope Emeritus, and pledged to remain “hidden to the world”, devoting himself to private prayer. He retired to in a monastery in Vatican City, where he read, wrote letters and articles, received guests and played the piano. But the former pope remained a powerful conservative influence and a focus for opponents of Francis’s efforts to reform the church and redirect it to serving the poor. He repeatedly made his views known through letters, articles and interviews. In April 2019, two months after Francis convened a groundbreaking Vatican conference on sexual abuse, Benedict published a 6,000-word letter saying abuse was a product of a culture of sexual freedom dating from the 1960s. In January 2020, Benedict publicly defended clerical celibacy, as Francis was considering allowing married men to become priests in limited circumstances. “I cannot keep silent,” he wrote in a book, From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church, arguing that priestly celibacy protected the mystery of the church. The controversy, which erupted just before The Two Popes – a film about the apparently warm relationship between Benedict and Francis – was aired on Netflix, exposed tensions between rival Vatican camps.

"As a child in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso remembers excitedly readying himself in front of a handheld meat grinder to crush cashews. It was his part in his family’s annual tradition of preparing a 60-year-old recipe for Christmas cake that had been passed down for generations. Christmas cake – a moist, decadent treat filled with nuts and fruit – usually kicks off the holiday season on the island nation, and for immigrants in the US, has become a way to preserve traditions from back home. Sri Lanka’s Christmas cake is similar to the fruit cake, a quintessentially British dish, but has since evolved from its colonial roots. Like the British version, Christmas cake includes raisins and cherries, but also preserved ginger, the green vegetable chayote (or chow chow, as Sri Lankans call it) in sugar syrup, preserved melon (known as puhul dosi), candied peel, sultanas and aromatics like nutmeg. “It definitely has been adapted to the Sri Lankan palate,” says Cumaraiah-Misso, 34, now a medical student living in Fort Worth, Texas. He still remembers being a child and the earthy aromas of cinnamon and cardamom intermingling with the sweet smell of rose essence while being elbow-deep in a 25-gallon bucket, mixing finely chopped fruit semolina with butter. Marie Shirlene Fernando, 58, a caterer and mother of three living in Cerritos, California, remembers watching her aunt make the cake as a little girl. As a teenager, she took over the responsibility of making the stodgy treat, first for her ailing grandmother and later for her extended family to give as wedding favors. Now, she makes it with her 10-year-old granddaughter for customers across the United States. She carefully wraps the final product in parchment paper and brightly colored cellophane. This year, one of the packages will be shipped to her family in Sri Lanka. Given the country’s recent economic and political woes, she hopes the beloved dessert will help evoke unity and remind her mother, sister and extended family, of simpler times of gathering around the table to prepare the cake ingredients. In Sri Lanka, as the country’s hotels gear up for the holiday season, some host cake-mixing parties, where people get a view of culinary staff combining the fruit and nut mixture with the wet ingredients in a custom-built, 9ft-deep barrel. The mix weighs more than 4,000lb. This year, one even took place aboard a naval ship. Fernando said she was watching the Galle Face Hotel’s recent Christmas cake mixing ceremony and thought to herself, “Oh, I’m so glad in spite of all that’s going on, they are still doing it.” These traditions were in jeopardy this year as the nation battled its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Government corruption, financial mismanagement, sluggish economic growth since the pandemic, the depletion of foreign reserves and the war in Ukraine led to widespread blackouts, shortages of essential goods and school closures earlier this year. Islandwide protests ultimately led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the resignation of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. Inflation hit an all-time high of 69.8% in October before dropping slightly to 61% in November. While Fernando is hopeful that the nostalgia of Christmas cake-making will provide some joy to celebrations, Cumaraiah-Misso worries about how the increased prices of ingredients will affect this longstanding tradition. On local Facebook groups, bakers lament the rising cost of ingredients, with some commenting that they have chosen not to make the treat this year and are readying themselves for an “austere Christmas”. In a country ravaged by a 30-year civil war fought on ethnic lines and where, in 2019, at least 290 people died as bombs ripped through three churches on Easter Sunday, Christmas cake can unite across religions. It’s not just the 8% of the country’s Christian population that enjoy it. “There are so many Buddhists, Muslims, friends who I have who are non-Christians. They love the Christmas cake, and they wait for a piece of Christmas cake,” Fernando said. She recalls them asking, “Where is my share? Did you keep me a piece?” Indrika Arnold, a wealth adviser in Lebanon, New Hampshire, has found another set of fans for her Christmas cake: her American co-workers. “I have some colleagues at work with whom I shared a piece, and they loved it. Now, they always ask, ‘When are you making your spice cake?’” she said. “I even mail it to some of my friends who no longer work with me.” She only made a half recipe when she started making Christmas cake five years ago. Now she’s doubled it. Arnold moved to the US 22 years ago but only started making the rich cake – as it’s known at other times of year – to share the tradition with her 12-year-old daughter. She has core memories of sitting around the kitchen table with her siblings and parents, cutting the preserved fruit into small pieces, and sneaking bits of raisins and cashews into her mouth when no one was looking. “A week or two before Thanksgiving, I get all the ingredients, and we actually get together as a family and cut it and we all take turns mixing the booze and the honey,” she said about how she continues this tradition with her daughter and husband in the US. She then leaves the fruits to stew in the alcohol mixture for at least two weeks, kick starting the holidays in their home. Like Arnold, Fernando also plans to gather around the table with her granddaughter to finely chop the fruit, which will then be soaked in a brandy mixture for one day. “By making it every Christmas, it has become a part of celebrating Christmas as Sri Lankans overseas,” Fernando said."
"Father Happy Jacob has a reason to be cheerful. When he started St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church in Liverpool in 2002, his congregation numbered about 60 families, and stayed at that level for almost two decades. Then, a few years ago, things began to change. “We have seen a massive increase in families coming to the church,” says Jacob, 48. At his last count, there were 110 families, with worshippers including NHS workers, international students and about 100 school-age children. This story is being repeated across Britain. From Liverpool to London, Preston to Bristol, church congregations are being bolstered by Indian Christians. Most are from southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where Christianity is strong. Many have recently moved to the UK. The boom is in sharp contrast to the national trend. According to the latest census, Christianity is in decline in England and Wales: the portion of the population describing itself as Christian has fallen from 59.3% in 2011 to 46.2% in 2021. But the number of Indian Christians has surged over the same period. While they remain a small portion of the total number – about 27.5 million –who say they are Christian, the Indian contingent rose from 135,988 in 2011 to 225,935 in 2021, the fastest rise of any ethnic group. “There are lots and lots of Christians coming from India,” says Rev Joshva Raja of the British and Foreign Bible Society. As well as boosting dedicated Indian churches, the new arrivals are contributing particularly to Catholic congregations, but Raja says: “I see some of the Anglican churches growing too.” Some of those arriving grew up as part of protestant denominations that were founded in India after it gained independence in 1947. NHS worker Pradeep George, 42, secretary at the Church of South India in East Ham, east London, says the number of families attending has doubled since before Covid to about 80. Services are quite similar to Church of England ones, with hymns, bible readings and a few twists, such as plum cake – popular in Kerala. Jacob’s church in Liverpool is part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church, also known as Indian Orthodox, which traces its origins to the arrival of Saint Thomas in India in 52 AD. The church’s weekly “energetic gathering” lasts about two hours and is usually held in Malayalam, Kerala’s official language. Afterwards, people stay to socialise for much of the day, sharing foods such as appam – fluffy rice pancakes – lamb biryani or croissants with tea. There is also a Sunday school with about 100 pupils. Over Christmas, carol singers from St Thomas’s run a door-to-door service in Liverpool, Chester and beyond, visiting all the families from the congregation. This weekend, dressed in Christmas jumpers, they were in the living room of Suriya Varghese, 37, and her husband Anup Cherian, 40, who recently started attending the church with their three children. The Keralan family had been living in Qatar before moving to the UK last year after both parents got jobs as electrical design engineers for the same company. Their involvement with the church extends far beyond Sunday services. Their children – Abner, 10, Anika, 7, and Arush, 4 – attend the Sunday school, where Suriya teaches. They had help from the church network with everything from finding housing and applying for driving licences to coping with UK weather and picking trustworthy handymen. “The church plays a very big role in our lives,” says Anup. “This is about being part of the community, especially for the kids.” For Ephrem Sam Mattappallil and his friends, the support afforded by the church community has also been a lifeline. Mattappallil, 25, who moved to London last year to study, runs a support group for students within the Indian Orthodox Church, many of whom are “struggling”. Last year, it helped about 120 people. “Our parents, relatives and friends are not here, and there is financial pressure as well,” Mattappallil says. “Through the church, we can find a lot of friends, and share our experiences. It helped me a lot.” Elsewhere, Indian Christians are finding community in mainstream churches. At the Catholic church of St Osmund in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Father Jonathan Creer has been “surprised” and “delighted” by the trend. He said that in the past two years, mass attendance has been boosted by a “huge increase in the Indian community”, many of whom work at the local NHS hospital. The Indian families also include large numbers of children, teenagers and 20-somethings, who seem to have a more positive attitude to religion than some of their young British counterparts, he says. The increase has been particularly noticeable since the Covid lockdowns. “Some of our congregation – mostly older, white people – have still not come back, and some of them died, so it’s very noticeable now, looking out at mass, that we have many Asian and other faces,” Creer said. “It’s quite surprising in Salisbury, because you walk around the streets and it seems almost a mono-ethnic place, but actually, that’s not true.” He said that despite what some might think, the new arrivals had been really welcomed with open arms. “You might imagine that in a rather staid, middle-England place like Salisbury, people might wonder what was going on, but they have been delighted.” One way the congregation has embraced the Indian newcomers is by embracing a tradition observed in Kerala of passing around a “quite large” statue of the Virgin Mary, with a different worshipper taking it home each week. “People were very enthused about that,” Creer said. At other churches, Indian Christians have found themselves in the minority. Arun Vedhanayagam Selwyn, from Chennai in Tamil Nadu, began attending the Anglican St John the Baptist church in Eltham, south-east London, after moving to the UK last year. “It’s mostly people from the local area at services,” he says. “It’s very rare to see another person from India.” At 25, the master’s student at Greenwich university is also much younger than most of the other worshippers. “Mostly it’s old age people here,” he says. “Whereas in India, people from different age categories come to the church.” Nevertheless, he has found the community “very welcoming”. The services in Eltham are also more fun, he says. Back home in India, he says, they “drag the service out for hours” whereas here it’s “very compact, so no one gets bored. I like the vibe.”"
"It was 4am on a Monday and most of Rio de Janeiro was asleep. But in the Morro do 77, a favela on the gritty westside of town, the party was just getting under way as hundreds of revellers packed the community’s main thoroughfare to strut their stuff before a three-metre (10ft) wall of sound. Speakers and subwoofers pumped ear-shattering favela funk music into the dawn air. Partygoers drank pint-sized cups of whiskey and frozen coconut water. And as heads bobbed, bodies twerked and window panes shook, the rave’s unexpected name flashed up on a screen above the dancefloor in a distinctly British blaze of red, blue and white. “The Baile de Londres,” it said. “The Party of London.” “Sometimes people go straight to work afterwards,” said one of the DJs, Hyago Domingos de Lima, before his deafening setlist rendered conversation impossible. The Sunday night blowout – during which partygoers, including one wearing an England football shirt, danced until 7am – is one of scores of favela funk parties now named after cities and countries around the world. The trend began about five years ago when musicians in one of Rio’s largest favelas, the Complexo do Lins, founded the Baile da Colombia (the Party of Colombia), a reference to the Brazilian neighbour’s long-running conflict and the deadly violence that also blights many gang-controlled areas in Rio. Sensing a foreign name could increase their brand profile and attract larger audiences, event organisers in favelas across the city reached for their maps. In Chapadão they named their event after Egypt, in Parque das Missões, Poland, and in Parque Arará, Portugal. One favela opted for China and used the Chinese national flag to advertise its rave. Another chose Japan, in homage to a local gangster nicknamed after the east-Asian country. In São Gonçalo, a satellite city to Rio’s east, promoters picked US cities, including New York, Brooklyn and Las Vegas. In Rocinha they celebrated Russia with the Baile de Moscow. In Jacarezinho they created the Baile de Paris. “I think there’s one named after every single country in the world,” said Kaio Gonçalves da Silva. The 26-year-old DJ plays at funk parties named after Acapulco and Saudi Arabia in Duque de Caxias, a city to Rio’s north. On his customised Sonic the Hedgehog motorbike, it takes him five minutes to get between the two gigs. “There the Party of Canada. There’s Libya. There’s Korea … There’s Croatia. There’s Sweden. I think there’s an Italy one too … There’s Ireland. There’s Scotland,” said Da Silva, AKA DJ Kaio VDM, the composer of a recent hit celebrating the Brazil and West Ham footballer Lucas Paquetá. Luiz Júnior, a DJ and producer from a westside favela called Vila Aliança, said that by the time the area’s musicians decided to adopt a country, “there were hardly any left”. So they plumped for Romania. “To be honest, I don’t know anything about Romania. Lots of people here don’t even know what the capital is … [But] people really liked the colour of the flag,” said Júnior, whose sound system, Ignorant, rents out massive custom-made speaker systems to parties including Argentina, Mexico and Iraq. Lima, whose DJ name is HG, came up with the Baile de Londres while shooting the breeze in Morro do 77’s main square with his friends Fatty Psycho, Haze, Xiclaudio and Big Dave. At first they considered Guatemala. Then someone floated England. But the Portuguese word for England (Inglaterra) had too many syllables and was a mouthful for MCs, he said. So they opted for the Baile de Londres and a new UK-themed Rio rave was born, with fliers featuring pictures of of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. Lima, who like most of the favela’s residents has never travelled abroad, admitted his knowledge of the UK capital was patchy. “When I think of London I think of … all those big buildings and that lake with the bridge over it,” he said of Tower Bridge. Marcelo Henrique dos Anjos da Silva, a dancer whose mesmerising dance steps at the Baile de Londres often go viral social media, associated London with little but the cold. “It’s the sort of place you need a jacket and a scarf,” Da Silva, whose nickname is ML, said as he sat in Morro do 77’s plaza in flip-flops and shorts. The creation of the Party of London has given the Brazilian favela a curiously British feel. The main street, Francisco Brício Avenue, has been informally renamed the Retão de Londres, which roughly translates as London Street. Last year a local football team was founded: the Seleção de Londres or Team London. In true English style, they made it to the final of the favela’s annual tournament but then lost. “They thrashed us: 4-0 or something,” said Pedro Gomes, one of the team’s defenders, as he showed off the favela’s synthetic pitch wearing his union-flag-branded kit. Gomes, who works in a hospital pharmacy when not protecting London’s goal, said the baile was an essential form of leisure for overburdened residents of his deprived neighbourhood. “It’s a way locals have off enjoying themselves when all they do is work, work, work. People need to have fun too,” the 25-year-old said as the event’s giant sound system was assembled behind him outside the evangelical church Vida Em Graça (Life in Grace). Rio’s funk scene has long been criminalised and vilified by authorities and critics who accuse it of glorifying drugs, guns and sex, although in recent years the movement has been widely recognised as a culture treasure and even celebrated in one of Brazil’s top art museums. The parties are also a crucial economic lifeline for Rio’s favelas, which are home to about 20% of the city’s population. Twenty-four hours before the Baile de Londres kicked off, Adriana da Silva Lucena set off from her home in the Vila Ideal favela to sell drinks at the Baile de Acapulco. “Our lives are tough and if it wasn’t for the baile lots of people would be going hungry,” said Lucena, a 51-year-old single-mother in an area where many families depend on benefits. “It’s tiring. It’s stressful … When you get home you’re dead after working all night,” she said of her nocturnal shifts. “But I love this community. Acapulco is my life because, like it or not, I live off Acapulco.” Wagner Oliveira, the 32-year-old owner of a clothes shop in Vila Ideal named after the Mexican holiday destination, said: “People think bailes are just about taking drugs and boozing. But the bailes benefit so many people in the community.” A born-again Christian, Oliveira no longer attended the raves and was not a fan of the musical style and its sexually explicit lyrics. Nevertheless, he called the parties a vital part of favela life. “Only people who live here grasp how important this is. Outsiders just don’t get it at all.” Moments later, the volume was cranked up and partiers began to arrive for a night of unbroken hedonism. Oliveira shut up shop and headed home, placing Mexico’s Aztec-inspired tricolour in his shop window beside a note to would-be customers. “Be right back,” it said."
"Production was suspended at the last operating domestic factory of Japanese automaker Daihatsu on Tuesday, as the Toyota subsidiary grapples with a safety testing scandal affecting 64 models going back more than three decades. Issues with falsified crash tests first came to light in April, when the firm admitted it had manipulated data on four models manufactured in Thailand and Malaysia from 2022 until this year. The company has since acknowledged that similar issues have occurred across almost its entire production process, with an internal investigation discovering falsified data dating back to 1989. “We betrayed the trust of our customers,” said Daihatsu CEO Soichiro Okudaira at a Tokyo press conference last week. “All the blame is on the management.” On 20 December the company announced it would halt shipments of all models while further investigations and safety checks are carried out. Initial investigations have found that the shortening of vehicle development time was likely the main cause of corners being cut on safety checks. Head of the investigating panel Makoto Kaiami said, “There was tremendous pressure on employees as altering sales schedules due to test failures was widely seen as unacceptable.” Daihatsu identified doors that can become difficult to open from the outside after an accident as the major safety issue, though there have been no reports of related injuries. Included in the 64 models are vehicles manufactured by Daihatsu under contract for Toyota, Mazda and Subaru. Production is currently set to be suspended at its factories across Japan until at least the end of January, affecting 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 suppliers. Daihatsu produced about 870,000 vehicles in Japan last year, a supply chain worth approximately 2.2tn yen (US$15bn). Daihatsu, which was founded in Osaka in 1907 and taken over by Toyota in 1967, is currently negotiating with unions and suppliers over compensation while production remains suspended. Although Japanese cars are known for their safety and reliability, the industry has been hit by numerous scandals over the years. In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors finally confessed to covering up defects in its vehicles dating back to 1977, after partially admitting to related problems four years earlier. Similar issues then emerged at its subsidiary Fuso Truck and Bus in what became one of Japan’s worst corporate scandals. Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Subaru and Yamaha Motors were all embroiled in inspections and data-tampering scandals between 2017 and 2018. Daihatsu’s parent company Toyota paid a record $1.2bn settlement to the US Justice Department in 2014 over a series of claims about accelerator pedals and subsequent accidents. No mechanical fault was ever discovered despite numerous investigations and driver error remains the most likely explanation for the crashes that occurred."
"Before the arrival of Lundin Oil in the town of Leer, now part of South Sudan, life there was peaceful, says George Tai Kuony. His childhood was that of a “typical village boy”, driving cattle, helping his family and going to school. But in June 1998, when he was 15, armed forces entered the town and changed his life for ever. He fled, became separated from his family and hid for seven days before he was able to return. “When we got there, Leer wasn’t the town I had left seven days ago,” says the 40-year-old lawyer and human rights defender. “Everything was burned down, everything was destroyed. I could see the bodies of dead people lying in the street.” As a result of the conflict, he lost his father, and later his mother and one sibling. At the time, he says, the community had no idea why people were fighting. They had never heard of the Swedish oil company. Now, a quarter of a century later, Kuony hopes that he and the other victims will get justice as two former executives of the company go on trial in Stockholm accused of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sudan between 1999 and 2003. In Sweden’s largest-ever trial, Ian Lundin, a Swede, and Alex Schneiter, who is Swiss, stand accused of asking Sudan’s government to make its army and allied militia responsible for security at one of Lundin Oil’s exploration fields. This led to aerial bombings, civilian killings and the burning of entire villages, according to the prosecution. Both men deny the charges. The trial, which follows a decade-long investigation, hundreds of interviews and an 80,000-page report by the prosecution, started in September. But its most significant moments are expected in 2024, when 61 witnesses – including victims, Lundin employees, former UN staff and high-profile politicians – are due to appear. They include Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, who sat on the company’s board for five years until becoming the country’s foreign minister. “My life has never been the same,” says Kuony, speaking to the Observer from South Sudan’s capital, Juba, where he now lives. “Oil came to our area: it should have been a blessing. It should have been for the benefit of the community.” Instead, there was “a massacre. They wanted us dead. They wanted us to go away.” Kuony has been trying to get justice since 2006, when the group unsuccessfully sought redress at a court in Sudan. He hopes the trial, whatever its outcome, will set a new legal precedent for global corporations working in foreign jurisdictions, sending a “very strong message” that they cannot act with impunity. “That one day they will be prosecuted in the same way.” But the victims have already been dealt a significant blow. Ebony Wade, a legal adviser at Stockholm-based human rights organisation Civil Rights Defenders, said Stockholm district court’s decision in November to separate the plaintiffs’ damage claims from the criminal trial would make it “significantly harder” – if not impossible – to have their cases heard, and would considerably delay the justice process. While the plaintiffs’ testimonies were still expected to be included in the criminal trial, she said, this could push the civil claims back until the criminal trial was over, which would not be until February 2026. However, May 2024 will be a historic moment: for the first time the court will hear the experiences of plaintiffs and victims from South Sudan. “It’s incredibly rare for corporate executives to be held accountable for grave human rights violation,” says Wade. “For the first time, the leadership of a multinational company is being put on trial in a European country on allegations that they were complicit in war crimes in the conduct of their business activities.” She adds: “There are very few opportunities for victims of grave international crimes to seek redress, so in that sense this is an incredibly important trial.” Rev James Ninrew Dong, of the Presbyterian Church in South Sudan, fled Leer after religious buildings were targeted. The priest, who is a witness and a plaintiff in the case, said he felt compelled to testify: “They attacked us. They displaced us. What made me sorry is that people came to the church seeking safety and were not able to get it. They were also displaced.” For him, the case demonstrates the different standards applied by European companies operating in Africa. “Sweden is the champion of peace in the whole of Europe and this is where the Nobel prize is always done,” he says. “We were surprised to see that some citizens of the same country do not even care and do not even listen to what the history is.” For the case to finally be in court is a relief, he adds. “Can they do that in Norway? Can they do that in Sweden? Can they do that in any of the European countries? Of course no – the answer is no.” • The headline of this article was amended on 16 January 2024 to refer to “South Sudanese” rather than “Sudanese” and a picture caption was amended to refer to Juba, South Sudan, not Juba, Sudan."
"Accusations are growing that the former Sri Lankan government, led by strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, blocked an investigation into the country’s worst terrorist attack amid claims that they had helped orchestrate the blasts in order to return to power. In the attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019, six suicide bombers targeted churches and luxury hotels across the country, killing 269 people, including eight British tourists. But almost five years on, an investigation has failed to provide any answers for how the attacks took place and the security failures that led up to them. So far, there have been no criminal convictions. Instead, people previously involved in the investigation, and the leader of Sri Lanka’s Catholic church, have alleged that inquiries were repeatedly sabotaged and obstructed by the Rajapaksa government. In a recent documentary for Channel 4’s Dispatches, a whistleblower alleged that the attacks were part of a plan to create instability in Sri Lanka and ensure that Rajapaksa, a member of Sri Lanka’s most powerful political family, would win the presidential elections in 2019. The source said he had helped an intelligence officer with close ties to the Rajapaksa family meet members of the local Islamist militant group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ), that carried out the attack. He said it had been part of a plan that had been hatched over a couple of years to create an “unsafe” security situation that would help bring Rajapaksa to power. The Rajapaksa family had ruled Sri Lanka for almost a decade from 2005. They were credited with ending its bloody, 26-year-long civil war but became notorious for their authoritarian methods, including the use of “death squads” to target critics and journalists. Mahinda Rajapaksa was ousted in 2015 after a backlash against alleged corruption, but the family had planned a return to power in the 2019 election, this time with younger brother Gotabaya as the presidential candidate. He won the election but was toppled dramatically from power in July last year, after the country experienced a catastrophic economic crisis, and replaced by Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is seen as close to the Rajapaksa family. Ravi Seneviratne, the former director general of police who initially led the Easter attacks investigation, told the Observer that after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected president, the government had “prevented the investigation”. He said his team had already “established links” between state and military intelligence officers and the NTJ suicide bombers. He said that the investigations had also led him to believe there was someone higher up helping to coordinate the attack who had yet to be apprehended. However, when Rajapaksa took office, Seneviratne’s entire team at CID was taken off the case. More than 20 of his officers were transferred without his approval and travel bans were imposed on all 700 CID officers. “The motive was to make them too scared to send a message. Many were too scared to work and some people even applied for transfers out of CID,” he said. Since then, Seneviratne claims there have been several attempts to “keep me quiet”. The targeting of those involved in the investigation took a murkier turn this month after the attorney general told the courts that there had been a conspiracy to murder Shani Abeysekara, the former head of Sri Lanka’s CID, who was overseeing the investigation before he was suddenly removed when the Rajapaska government came to power. A court petition filed by Abeysekara, which was taken up this month, said a plan to kill him in a staged vehicle accident had been uncovered. The petition identifie dhis involvement in the bombing investigation as one of the reasons for the assassination attempt. Upul Jayasuriya, the lawyer representing Abeysekara, said that his client’s involvement in the Easter bombing investigation was “one of the biggest problems”. Still fearful for his life, Abeysekara declined to comment directly on the case. Last year, Abeysekara went public with allegations that prior to the attacks – when the CID was already investigating NTJ militants – state and military intelligence officers had sabotaged the investigation and “fabricated” evidence to divert investigators away from the group, including ringleader Zahran Hashim, who later carried out one of the suicide bombings. He has also alleged that his attempts to raise the issue of NTJ militants with the national security council had been obstructed. After the Easter bombings, he said, his investigators had established links and vidence of communication between intelligence officials and members of the NTJ group that carried out the attacks. Another former CID officer who was part of an investigation into NTJ militants months before the bombings, and who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, confirmed the accounts. “There were several attempts that were made by the military intelligence and state intelligence to sabotage the criminal investigation department’s work,” he said. While more than 200 people have been charged in the investigation, so far no one has been convicted, and there have been no answers on how several specific high-level warnings about the imminent attacks, particularly from Indian intelligence, were ignored. In January, former president Maithripala Sirisena, who was in power at the time of the attacks, was ordered by the supreme court to pay millions in compensation to the victims. Following the Dispatches revelations, the Sri Lankan government said it had set up a special parliamentary committee to investigate allegations, but sources said that no one had been called to testify before it. A recent statement by the ministry of defence said the government “vehemently denounces the accusation of orchestrating the attack and assisting the bombers against a dedicated senior military officer who has served the nation for 36 years”. The ministry added that “successive Sri Lankan governments have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth”. Gotabaya Rajapaksa could not be reached for comment. Among the harshest critics of the ongoing failures is Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka, who alleges there was a cover-up from the highest levels of government. “When Gotabaya Rajapaksa came to power, he appointed a stooge to take over the case who made a blunder of all investigations,” he said. “We know that there are several occasions when evidence was deliberately covered up. They have made a mockery of transparency, a mockery of accountability and a mockery of democracy.” Ranjith added: “We are demanding a transparent, accountable investigation where the politicians don’t meddle with the investigators.” For the families of the victims, the lack of justice has been excruciating. “I ask God every day to take us too. How can we live with this pain?” said Sebastian Patrick Fernando, 74, who lost his son Neranjan in the attack on St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo. “We voted for the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government thinking they would give us answers. But they have done nothing, and now people say they did it to come to power. They should be held responsible.” Thilina Harshani, who was paralysed from the waist down and lost her six-year-old son in the blast, also blames the government for inaction. “Why did this happen to us?” she said. “Why did they bomb our church? Why were we targeted? And why are the masterminds still on the loose?”"
"The US government has announced the release of what it said was its last available package of weapons available for Ukraine, with Congress needing to decide on future support. According to the state department, it is worth up to $250m and includes air defence munitions and components, Himars ammunition, 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, anti-armour munitions, and over 15m rounds of ammunition. The war in 2024 “must be different from 2023”, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces has said. “Otherwise we will face what I wrote about in the article [the Economist]”, said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi. “Unfortunately, I must state that the enemy is not far behind us. In recent days, we have had a powerful confrontation applying modern technologies. But we do not spare efforts. My main mistake was that I thought that the amount of losses we inflicted on the enemy would stop anyone. But not the Russian Federation.” Zaluzhnyi, giving a press conference, said Ukrainian troops remained on a defensive line in the northern part of Maryinka. “But I can say that this settlement no longer exists. The [Russian] method is the same as it was in Bakhmut. Street by street, block by block are destroyed. The fact that we have now moved to the outskirts of Maryinka, and in some places equipped positions beyond Maryinka, seems to me to be nothing that can cause a public outcry.” “As for the conduct of hostilities around Avdiivka,” he continued, “there is no need to dwell on it and make a show of it. The conduct of hostilities is subject to the laws of war, and they are not subject to what politicians or journalists want. The enemy now has the opportunity to concentrate forces; they can do to the city in two or three months what they have done to Bakhmut.” Two people were killed in Russian drone attacks on Odesa, according to figures from the Odesa oblast governor, Oleh Kiper. A 17-year-old was among the wounded and remained in hospital. Russian shelling left 70% of Kherson without electricity, said the Kherson oblast governor, Oleksandr Prokudin. Shelling by Russian forces on Tuesday had “badly damaged” the infrastructure of the city, he said, adding that it was “difficult” to say when repairs would be completed. A railway station was attacked as a train was set to evacuate residents, killing one police officer and injuring four people. A Russian politician calling for peace in Ukraine has been denied the chance to run for president. Russia’s central election commission refused to accept the former regional legislator Yekaterina Duntsova’s initial nomination by a group of supporters, citing errors in the paperwork, including spelling. After losing Wednesday’s appeal against the commission’s decision, Duntsova said she would start working on the creation of her own political party that would stand for “peace, freedom and democracy”. Poland is getting closer to ending the truck driver blockades of several border crossings with Ukraine, says the country’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. Polish drivers have been blocking several crossings with Ukraine since 6 November, demanding the EU reinstate a system whereby Ukrainian companies need permits and the same for European truckers to enter Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks in Moscow with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and said progress had been made on plans for Russia and India to jointly produce military equipment. Jaishankar added that he expected Vladimir Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to meet next year. Russia says its newest howitzers will be deployed “soon” against Ukrainian forces. The head of the state-owned defence conglomerate Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, told the RIA news agency that testing of the new self-propelled artillery units, named Coalition-SV, had been completed and mass production had started, with the pilot batch to be delivered by the end of this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin must be stopped in his war against Ukraine or all of Europe will pay a much higher price, Moldova’s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, said in an interview published on Wednesday."
"Just after 3 o’clock, the children start running towards the Arab-Jewish community centre. The activities are about to begin – though this is not the reason for their haste. Moments before, sirens wailed across Tel Aviv and Jaffa, warning of another rocket attack. Some cry out in fear as the metal shutters of the centre rattle down. Ten minutes later, after two loud booms signal that the rockets launched from Gaza have been destroyed in the air, the children file out of the malodorous basement of the centre and head for gym class, music lessons and a crafts session organised by an NGO that is trying to improve relations between Israel’s Jewish and Arab populations. Even the most enthusiastic of Standing Together’s activists and leaders admit that, after 11 weeks of war, the moment is inauspicious for such initiatives. “These are extreme times. People are still processing the Hamas attack and the war in Gaza. People are in survival mode and thinking in black and white,” said Nadav Shofet, Standing Together’s lead community organiser in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. One slender reason for hope is sharp rise in volunteers since the war began, members of the NGO say. Since the Hamas attacks in southern Israel in October, which killed 1,200 people, mainly civilians, thousands have joined the organisation. During the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed about 18,000 people, mostly women and children, and destroyed swaths of the territory, more have come forward to work with the group. “People are looking for a solution … It might seem crazy now but it’s clear the only way out is peace,” said Shofet. Outside the community centre, overlooking a sweep of beach and the Mediterranean, the municipal authorities have hung a banner bearing the slogan: “Together, all Jaffa’s residents will get through this”. Inside, a menorah for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah stands alongside a Christmas tree. The combination of rain and rockets means about only six children have turned up for the crafts session organised by Standing Together. Orit Tammuz, a 65-year-old Jewish former dancer, had brought her granddaughter Amani. “For me, all this is a natural thing. Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Jews, in our family we don’t make a difference. There is no victory if this is not a country for all of us,” she said. Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise 21% of the population, often living in cities where they are a majority. Jaffa, with its mixed community, has attracted many young Jewish families in recent years, many with progressive views who feel out of step with the rightwards trend of Israeli society in general. This has led to sharp increases in property prices, which have forced out often poorer Arab residents. Tammuz admitted that neither Jaffa nor the crafts class was very representative of Israel, particularly at the moment. “Here, this is like being in a small bubble but we hope it will become bigger, or I don’t see any solution,” she said. Other activities run by Standing Together include food distributions to families experiencing economic hardship, renovating public bomb shelters and a series of well-attended rallies. The organisation, founded in 2016, has also set up an unarmed joint Arab-Jewish “civil guard” to protect all communities and alert police in the event of violence. The goal of many efforts was simply to bring members of different communities together, said Amir Badran, an organiser in Jaffa for Standing Together and a local politician and lawyer. This includes the popular children’s craft sessions, held every week for two months. “Although people are in big distress, they would still prefer to get together … We don’t want the kids to be afraid of each other and hate each other. Here, they get to know each other and the parents get to meet,” Badran said. Quite how difficult finding the common ground that Standing Together seeks is clear to almost everyone in Israel. The government is the most rightwing in the country’s history, including politicians accused of “inflammatory rhetoric” before the current conflict. Though there have been no major outbreaks of violence, relations between the Jewish majority and citizens who are Arab, many of whom now identify as Palestinian citizens of Israel, are tense. “At times of war people become more radical, and [the right] is using this war to incite against Palestinian citizens,” said Rula Daood, Standing Together’s co-director. “Whether you are a regular, public or political figure, if you say anything that isn’t a call for revenge or wiping out Gaza, you are seen as part of the enemy now. Writing ‘May God have mercy on Gaza, children in Gaza’ – that’s enough to get you targeted.” Since the attacks on 7 October, a series of prominent Arab Israelis have been arrested. In October, the singer Dalal Abu Amneh was arrested briefly after posting “there is no victor but Allah” alongside a Palestinian flag on Facebook. Some of the community’s most prominent political leaders were held after planning an anti-war protest. Standing Together has set up a hotline “to give people a place, Palestinian or Jews, to turn to” if they are being harassed. A recent poll found nearly 60% of Arab Israelis were afraid of being harassed and 10% had personal experience of harassment. Daood said: “This is a real setback in Israeli society, especially Jewish society. The pain people are living in and the terror they have had since 7 October … It has basically blinded people and people are beginning to lose their own humanity. “We have had so many bad moments, maybe this is the most traumatic, but we have been able to rise up after each and every incident before. We are trying to show there is still another path and another way.” Among the people watching the children making finger puppets and posters in Jaffa was Vera Deek, an Arab Christian former teacher. “We believe in coexistence … that’s why I brought my daughter here. But [the problem] is not with the children,” Deek said. “It’s very difficult to be here, trying to live a normal life, when so many people have died or are still dying.” Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost friends and relatives in Gaza but also in the attacks on 7 October. Some of the first deaths reported were four people who died when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a Bedouin village in the Negev desert. Arab Israelis responding to the ground offensive, including paramedics, were also killed by Hamas. The Negev’s Bedouin tribes were some of the first to organise volunteer teams to search for missing Israelis. As she spoke, Deek jumped at the sounds of a construction site – similar to the booms of the anti-rocket batteries in action only a few minutes before – then explained that she was worried about her son, who was playing football in a nearby park. “Arabs and Jews must live together,” Deek said. “Ordinary people are not the problem.”"
"There was a familiar sense of misery for many travellers in the week before Christmas as hundreds of trains were cancelled, motorways were closed and ferry passengers queued for miles waiting to board their ships. But it doesn’t have to be this way, transport campaigners say, as politicians and transport bosses have the power to ease some of the problems facing travellers. There is more gloom to come in the short term, according to the RAC, with Boxing Day traffic surging, and the prospect of dangerous winds in Scotland and northern England. Around 21 million people drove to visit family or friends before Christmas, and thousands more took flights or trains as what has become known as the great Christmas getaway gained momentum. Storm Pia caused disruption to rail and road in Scotland and northern England on Wednesday. Eurostar workers in France took industrial action the following day, and the knock-on effect was huge demand for ferry services. Motorists queued for 90 minutes during peak times. Saturday was expected to be the busiest day of the year on the roads, according to the RAC and Inrix, with 20% more car journeys than last Christmas weekend. On Boxing Day they expect drivers on the M25 to face 50-minute delays, and on 27 December journeys in busy areas of the UK will be 25% longer. On Saturday Port of Dover Travel reported a 90-minute wait at French border controls as traffic built up after a surge in ferry bookings in the wake of Thursday’s Eurotunnel disruption. And the Met Office is warning of high winds in Scotland, northern England and north Wales today, with possible power cuts and flying debris. Even though the weather may be out of the control of ministers and rail chiefs, they have other ways of easing the burden on travellers, according to the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and the Clean Cities Campaign (CCC). National Highways removed 1,000 miles of roadworks on 19 December – “an early Christmas present” for drivers during the festive getaway. They will be back on 2 January. Widespread engineering works are planned for the rail network, although Network Rail said it was carrying out less work than usual, and no trains run on Christmas Day. In London, Paddington station is shut until Wednesday for HS2 works, while King’s Cross is shut today and Victoria station is not running Southeastern services until 2 January. And passengers will be gambling with services by operators such as Avanti West Coast, which cut services in December and has seen 32% of services cancelled or severely delayed. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” said Michael Solomon Williams, CBT campaigns manager. “It’s not rational any more to distinguish between commuter travel and leisure travel.” Since the pandemic, fewer people travel during the week, he said. “People work weekends, go to football matches. There are all sorts of reasons why we need more services at weekends and Christmas, when people travel around the country more than any other time. “Another time makes more sense, like the second week of January, or on a Monday, for example.” He added that another balm for travellers would be the creation of Great British Railways, announced by the government in May 2021 but mothballed in October 2022. And passengers are being told to pay an extra 4.9% on rail fares in the new year. “They could have frozen fares the way they have with fuel duty for the last 13 years,” Solomon Williams said. “The cost of travelling by train has gone up at twice the rate of driving.” Oliver Lord, head of CCC, said that disrupting services on the busiest travel days of the year meant people were more likely to choose to take the car, adding to congestion. “A third of rail use now is on leisure,” he said. “If the three or four times a year a family wants to use trains to get out of town, and their experience is engineering works, a rail replacement bus service and journeys that take three times as long, what will they think? “It’s a great opportunity for the government to make a strategic decision,” Lord added. “If we said the first week or two of January was a time when businesses and corporations could do things a bit differently, with more working from home, that would be a great new year’s resolution from the government.” Travellers who have faced cancellations or delays should make sure they claim compensation, said Naomi Leach, deputy editor of Which? Travel. “Sadly, it seems as though serious travel disruption over the festive period is becoming increasingly commonplace, with travellers once again facing the misery of cancelled trains as they try to make it home in time for Christmas,” she said. “If your train is cancelled or delayed, make sure you make a note of your ticket number and register a claim via Delay Repay, a nationwide scheme to compensate rail passengers for delays of 15 minutes or more. “The Eurostar operates its own compensation scheme for delays of an hour or more which accepts claims from 24 hours after the disruption took place.”"
"A person has died in Scotland after falling ill with E coli, in what appears to be the first death linked to an outbreak that has affected at least 30 people. The UK Health Security Agency said the death “has been associated with this outbreak” and added later that it occurred in Scotland, but was unable to provide more information about the case. The agency said that as of 27 December there had been 30 confirmed cases in England and Scotland linked to an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), which first emerged in July. The cases involved children as young as seven and those aged up to 81, and most cases had occurred in December. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland announced a precautionary recall of four cheeses made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese on Christmas Eve due to possible E coli contamination. It added a fifth product, which is sold by Waitrose, to the recall list on 27 December. “Epidemiological and food chain investigations have identified links between some of the identified cases and a number of unpasteurised cheeses produced by a business in England,” the agency said. “UKHSA is continuing to follow up cases to identify any common links, including determining whether cases ate or came into contact with the recalled cheeses.” The products affected by the recall are: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild &amp; Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese. Amy Douglas, the agency’s incident director for gastrointestinal infections and food safety division, urged people who suspected they may have been infected not to travel over the holiday season. “There have been at least 30 confirmed cases of this specific outbreak strain of Stec in the UK,” she said. “Symptoms of Stec include severe diarrhoea (including bloody diarrhoea), stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing it on to family and friends over the festive period. “Washing your hands with soap and warm water and using bleach-based products to clean surfaces will help stop infections from spreading. Don’t prepare food for others if you have symptoms or for 48 hours after symptoms stop. “Many of us will be travelling for Christmas, but if you are unwell you should avoid visiting people in hospitals and care homes to avoid passing on the infection in these settings. Do not return to work or school once term restarts, until 48 hours after your symptoms have stopped.” A spokesperson for Public Health Scotland said: “PHS can confirm there has been one death associated with E coli O145 in Scotland. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Scotland and are working with UKHSA, who are investigating at a UK-wide level.” A Scottish government spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with the loved ones of the person who has died. The Scottish government, Food Standards Scotland and Public Health Scotland will continue to do all we can to assist with the ongoing investigations. “We encourage everyone to check the product recall details on the Food Standards Scotland website. Cheeses are sometimes included as part of a hamper, served as individual portions or bought as a gift, so it may not always be clear whether you have purchased an affected product.”"
"The Middle East has been slipping towards the precipice of a regional war ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and the ferocious Israeli response in Gaza. The past week has shown how the cliff edge keeping it from that abyss could quickly crumble away. Within hours of the outbreak of the Gaza war, the Hezbollah Shia militia in Lebanon began to fire on northern Israeli towns and villages in solidarity with Palestinians, triggering Israeli air strikes in response, and Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea with real or perceived Israeli connections. The US moved two aircraft carriers and their accompanying strike groups to the region as American bases in Syria and Iraq came under repeated attacks from Iran-affiliated groups, drawing swift retaliation from Washington. At the same time the West Bank erupted in protests at the bombing of civilians in Gaza and extremist Jewish settlers quickly sought to ride the wave of Israeli anger by seizing Palestinian land and terrorising its residents. Each of these theatres of conflict has the potential to ignite a much-feared Middle East conflagration, and the past few days have demonstrated just how easily escalation, intended or not, could bring Israel into open confrontation with Iran, and suck in the US too. An Israeli airstrike just outside Damascus killed a senior figure in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Sayyed Razi Mousavi, who was responsible for military liaison between Syria and Iran. After Mousavi’s death last Monday, the IRGC issued a statement declaring the “usurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime”. Tehran’s Houthi allies have meanwhile have been firing on the US-led “Prosperity Guardian” naval task force assembled to protect shipping in the Red Sea. American warships shot down dozens of drones and also a handful of ballistic missiles. US Central Command issued a statement to say that Washington had “every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran”. If a US warship is struck, Joe Biden would be under intense pressure to deliver a decisive response, as he enters an election year with his tenure hanging in the balance and Republicans looking to focus on any trace of weakness. On Thursday, a former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, wrote a commentary in a US newspaper expressing the view of many on the hawkish end of the security establishments in both the Israel and the US that they are doomed to fight Iranian proxies indefinitely until Iran is taken on directly. “The evil empire of Iran must be brought down,” Bennett argued in the Wall Street Journal. “The US and Israel must set the clear goal of bringing down Iran’s evil regime. Not only is this possible. It is vital for the safety and security of the Middle East – and the entire civilised world.” On Friday, the UN security council convened to discuss violence on the West Bank, but the session was quickly drawn into a discussion of a regional war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, dismissed the issue of settler violence in the West Bank as a distraction from the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon. “The situation in northern Israel is reaching a point of no return,” Erdan said, echoing an increasingly frequent warning from Israeli officials that their country would take matters into its own hands, possibly by carving out a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. “If these attacks continue, I reiterate the situation will escalate and may lead to a full-scale war. Lebanon must be held accountable for the aggression carried out from its territory,” the Israeli envoy said. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, a UN assistant secretary-general, told security council members that, while most of the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been around the border, some strikes were going deeper into each other’s territory, “raising the spectre of an uncontained conflict with devastating consequences for the people of both countries”. Khiari added that “the risk of miscalculation and further escalation is increasing as the conflict in Gaza continues”. Lana Nusseibeh, the envoy of the United Arab Emirates, expressed the uneasiness of the Arab world that in the absence of “bold and perhaps uncomfortable decisions” to reverse the drift towards regional conflict, “the alternative is the hellscape of Gaza expanded into the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other parts of the Middle East”. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, the UN estimates that 304 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including 79 children, along with four Israelis, three of them soldiers. Four more Israelis were killed in West Jerusalem in an attack by Palestinian gunmen on 30 November. One of the dead was mistakenly shot by an Israeli soldier. The disproportionate number of Palestinian dead showed that Israeli forces have been conducting an overkill campaign in an effort to deter an uprising in the West Bank in solidarity with Gaza, argued Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “The Israeli mindset is that they think they are preventing a third Intifada,” Elgindy said. “But I think the way they’re operating, they’re probably more like causing one.” He pointed to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as a particularly volatile element in the combustible state of the region. Overwhelmingly blamed by Israelis for the security lapses that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, Netanyahu faces a fall from power, but only when the fighting ends, or at least lessens in intensity. An escalation, on the other hand, could keep him in his post. “It is Netanyahu, frankly, who is dictating the terms on all fronts – in Gaza, on the Lebanon border, across the region – for Netanyahu’s reasons. This is his war,” Elgindy said. He added: “ I think every day that this goes on, you get closer to regional expansion of this whole mess.”"
"A court in South Korea has approved an arrest warrant for the country’s suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached over his ill-fated decision to impose martial law early this month, investigators said. Yoon’s decision to declare martial law late on 3 December plunged Asia’s fourth-biggest economy into its worst political crisis for decades and caused concern in Washington. Yoon was forced to lift the order just six hours later after MPs forced their way into parliament to vote it down. The corruption investigation office confirmed that a court in Seoul had approved the warrant, but it was not clear if police would be able to execute it. “The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol … were issued this morning,” the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for Yoon, condemned the move. “The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid,” he said in a statement. Soon after investigators said they had raided the army’s counterintelligence offices as part of the growing martial law probe. “The emergency martial law investigation team of the Corruption Investigation Office is conducting a search and seizure operation at the Counterintelligence Command this afternoon,” investigators said in a statement. Yoon has so far refused to cooperate with the investigation into his martial law order. He has failed to report to investigators for questioning over allegations of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion, and his presidential security service has prevented court-ordered searches of his office and residence. Yoon also faces charges of insurrection – a crime that can carry life imprisonment or the death penalty and one of the few charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. An official from the corruption investigation office said Yoon’s refusal to be questioned had prompted the warrant request. “The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime,” the official said. The warrant is valid until 6 January, he said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre. Media reports said an imminent arrest or search of the presidential residence was unlikely, as investigators would seek to coordinate with the presidential security service. Technically, anyone obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant could be arrested. But under South Korean law, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it is unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces arrest. It is the first time an arrest warrant has been issued for an incumbent president in South Korea, according to local media. Police were deployed early on Tuesday outside Yoon’s residence in central Seoul in an attempt to prevent unrest. Yoon’s supporters and protesters calling for his removal have staked out his residence, with local media showing images of altercations between the two camps overnight. “Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?” Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon’s residence to show they were doing their work diligently and fairly. Park Sung-min, president of the Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant was probably an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with the investigation. The acting leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power party, Kweon Seong-dong, said on Tuesday that attempting to detain a sitting president was inappropriate, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the national assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December over his imposition of martial law. The constitutional court has 180 days from that date to decide whether to confirm the impeachment or reinstate Yoon, whose two-and-a-half years in office have been marred by scandal and policy deadlock. The martial law order triggered weeks of political and market turmoil. Yoon’s replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week for refusing to approve bills to facilitate the investigation into his predecessor. Han’s successor as interim president, Choi Sang-mok, had been in office for just two days when he was confronted with the fatal plane crash at Muan international airport, the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil. On Tuesday Choi called for national harmony and unity and for trust in the government in a New Year’s address. “The Republic of Korea is in an unprecedentedly serious situation,” Choi said in a written statement, citing changes around global trade, diplomacy and security, as well as domestic political uncertainty. “The government will do its best to run state affairs stably in all areas of defence, diplomacy, economy and society for the people to feel relieved,” he added.

"In the wake of the April 2019 fire that devastated Notre Dame, the French president Emmanuel Macron promised that the monument would be rebuilt with a “contemporary gesture”. There followed all manner of madcap ideas: a glass spire; a 300ft carbon-fibre flame; a swimming pool on the roof; a covered garden. In the end, Notre Dame was restored to its original former glory and ceremonially reopened this month. Now, however, the planned “contemporary gesture” has been revealed – and has sparked a bitter row. The French artist Claire Tabouret has been chosen to design new stained glass windows depicting Pentecostal scenes, to be installed in the chapels on the south side of the medieval church. Tabouret was among 100 artists who took part in a competition to replace the existing six windows installed by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in 1844 – even though the windows were not damaged in the 2019 fire. Designs submitted by Tabouret, 43, a figurative artist whose work featured in the Vatican pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year and who now lives in Los Angeles, show scenes of people in prayer in shades of red, turquoise, yellow and pink. She will work with master glassmakers at the Atelier Simon-Marq, a glass workshop founded in Reims in 1640, to recreate the drawings in glass. The plan to replace the 19th-century chapel windows, which feature geometric designs described as having more historic than aesthetic value, has enraged critics. The 1964 Venice Charter, which codifies guidelines for preserving French buildings, states: “Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation,” and that “the valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected”. In July, the national committee for heritage and architecture at France’s ministry of culture unanimously opposed the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows, prompting one artist to withdraw his designs from the competition. The Académie des Beaux-Arts has also opposed the replacing of the windows. In a statement last year, it wrote: “[The members of the academy] are concerned that the announcement of a competition for the creation of contemporary stained glass windows, which they support in principle, involves replacing the non-figurative windows ... The fire spared these windows. “The Académie des Beaux-Arts hopes that other locations, starting with the North Tower, will be considered for this commission for contemporary stained glass.” However, the plan, expected to cost more than €4m (£3.3m), has the approval of the president, the archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, and the church authorities. At a press conference after the announcement of her selection, Tabouret, a graduate of Paris’s prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, said she was “excited” by the challenge but aware of the controversy. “I’ve read about the different opinions of people because I want to understand their arguments and also to take an approach that is open and two-way. I find it a fascinating debate,” she said. She wanted to create stained glass windows that would have “the right presence … without imposing themselves on visitors”. Didier Rykner, a French journalist, art historian and founder of La Tribune de l’Art, a magazine dedicated to preserving France’s heritage, has described the idea of replacing the windows as “totally ludicrous”. He has launched a petition against the plan that has almost 250,000 signatures. “The president of the republic has decided on his own, without any regard for the heritage law or Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, to replace the stained glass windows in six out of the seven chapels on the south aisle with contemporary creations, after organising a competition,” it reads. “The stained glass windows in Notre Dame designed by Viollet-le-Duc were created as a coherent whole. It is a genuine creation that the architect wanted to be faithful to the cathedral’s gothic origins. Who gave the head of state a mandate to alter a cathedral that does not belong to him, but to everyone? “Emmanuel Macron wants to put the stamp of the 21st century on Notre Dame de Paris. Perhaps a little modesty would be preferable.” The French heritage association Sites &amp; Monuments has threatened legal action if the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows goes ahead. Rykner told the Observer: “To remove windows that survived the fire undamaged and replace them with others is just absurd. I am not against contemporary windows per se but there is just no reason to replace these windows. Besides, money donated by people to renovate Notre Dame has already been spent on cleaning them. “It’s absolutely ridiculous. We’ve been told they will put the Viollet-le-Duc windows on display in a museum. They don’t belong in a museum – they belong in Notre Dame. It makes no sense for them to be on display anywhere other than the cathedral. Their only interest is in situ.” He added: “I don’t see why Macron has such a say over what happens to a heritage building. This is just a vanity project. “As for the church authorities approving this – we should remember that the greatest vandalism done to French churches and religious buildings in the 60s and 70s was carried out … by the church. They have no taste.” Stéphane Bern, Macron’s former heritage tsar, voiced his opposition to the plan in an interview with Ouest France newspaper. “I have nothing against Claire Tabouret or contemporary stained glass ... But I am in favour of them when the old ones are destroyed or damaged. You can’t remove stained glass windows that are listed as historic monuments,” Bern said. “Why does the state set itself free from the rules it imposes on others? Just because the president wants it that way?” Simon-Marq will make the six new windows, which will reach 7m high and cover a total surface area of 121 sq metres, and are expected to be installed in 2026. Tabouret said she would be incorporating motifs from Viollet-le-Duc’s windows in the stained glass."
"I was drawn to Jonathan Freedland’s article (‘How do we live in this terrible world?’ a reader asked me. Here’s the only answer I have, 20 December), as it is a question that’s continually on my mind. There’s much substance in his well-informed piece, though the ending’s quite simple and resonates with my own take: “Perhaps by accepting that it’s the only one we have and that it’s not always so terrible – that sometimes, even quite often, it can be rather beautiful.” One of my responses to this ever-present question is to have gratitude for what I call “magic moments” in nature – like this morning catching sight of the heron, almost invisible, being so amazingly camouflaged among the reeds by a stream; I said “good morning, heron” softly, but didn’t linger because I’ve come to realise that they don’t like being looked at for long. A few years ago, I made a book of Marvellous Mundane Magic for my then 10-year-old granddaughter, to demonstrate to her that magic wasn’t solely the property of wizards. She loved it and now she’s noting her own and giving them to me to make a new book. Even a short early-morning walk offers magic if your eyes and ears are open, even if it’s just hearing a winter robin or seeing herb robert still flowering by a path. Margaret Turner Exeter • Jonathan Freedland gave us “a few reasons to be hopeful” about living in this terrible world. Thank you – they are good reasons: drawing strength from those who “dare to swim against even the bleakest tides”, celebrating what is good, and remembering that this is the only world we have, and that it is often beautiful. These reasons all involve looking outwards, observing. A complementary way of being hopeful – and happy – is looking inwards and acting on our values. Alone, or with the help of activist citizen groups. Thinking back, that is what the suffragettes did, the anti-apartheid activists and many others who have made the world a better place. Our thanks to them for doing more than observing. And happy new year to all. Patrick and Alison Duncan Norton, North Yorkshire • The most important component of staying optimistic in these troubled times is positive action. When we look at the world in despair, we should ask ourselves: “What can I do to improve it?” The only way the world gets better is through lots of people showing more love, empathy and care. Especially at Christmas, there are ample opportunities to make a difference to someone’s life. A donation to a charity, a kind word to a stranger, a Christmas card sent to a neighbour. Picking up rubbish, volunteering, donating to a food bank. It might not be much as a single deed, but imagine 9 billion little actions. Wow! Here’s to a better future for all. Hanna Pennig Forglen, Aberdeenshire • I cannot hope – but I can, and do, take it one day at a time. Being in the now opens me up to the small joys that everyday life offers. A toddler on the bus who smiles at me; a dog waiting patiently outside a supermarket; a sunny day. I have no agency to change the big things, but I am in control of how I respond to them. Lyn Dade Twickenham, London • Jonathan Freedland is helpful and encouraging in his reply to the question: “How do we live in this terrible world?” My own way of struggling with terrible news is to remind myself that wherever there is suffering, even of great magnitude, there are wonderful people struggling to alleviate it. The work they do and the sacrifices they make lift up our hearts and spirits. The annual Guardian and Observer charity appeal helps and encourages us to support such people not only at Christmas, but throughout the year.

"As families in Taiwan prepare to gather for lunar new year celebrations in January, a game that will be released that month promises to offer some war-themed fun over the festive period. The board game 2045, developed by the Taiwanese company Mizo Games, invites players to participate in an imaginary Chinese invasion 20 years in the future. Players are given roles that include Taiwanese army officers, Chinese sleeper agents and volunteer citizen fighters. “We can’t predict the future, but if a conflict is unavoidable I hope this game gives people a chance to experience war on the tabletop before it reaches us,” KJ Chang, the founder of Mizo Games, told the Wall Street Journal. The game is being released at a time when China has increased its military pressure around the self-governing island. Taiwan has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China but Beijing regards it as part of its territory and has promised to “unify” it with China, using force if necessary. Observers do not know when, if ever, China will launch a military operation against Taiwan. But some analysts have pointed to the years around 2050 as a possible risk period. Xi Jinping, China’s leader and military commander-in-chief, has pledged to build a “world-class army” by the middle of the century, and 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic of China, is the date by which Beijing wants to achieve “national rejuvenation”. Mizo Games launched a crowdfunding campaign for their new product in August. Within months, it had raised NTD$4.1m (£99,468), surpassing its original target by more than 4,000%. 2045 is the latest in a series of entertainment products in Taiwan that focus on the threat of an attempted Chinese annexation. This year also saw the release of Zero Day, a Taiwanese government-funded television series that depicts a Chinese invasion. It also received support from Robert Tsao, a Taiwanese tech billionaire and supporter of Taiwan’s civil defence efforts. As well as receiving the first copies of the game, VIP backers of the crowdfunding campaign will receive extra Taiwan-themed products. They include a leather passport cover embossed with the words: “Let my fly as a Taiwanese”, a nod to Taiwan’s lack of international recognition. Most countries in the world only have formal diplomatic relations with China. Beijing insists that countries should not recognise Taiwan as a separate country from China and puts pressure on governments to cut ties with Taipei."
"The tech entrepreneur and close adviser to Donald Trump Elon Musk has taken a stunning new public step in his support for the far-right German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), publishing a supportive guest opinion piece for the country’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that has prompted the commentary editor to resign in protest. The commentary piece in German was launched online on Saturday before being published on Sunday in the flagship paper of the Axel Springer media group, which also owns the US politics news site Politico. Musk uses populist and personal language to try to deny AfD’s extremist bent, and the essay expands on his post on his social media platform, X, on which he last week claimed that “only the AfD can save Germany”. Translated, Musk’s piece said: “The portrayal of the AfD as rightwing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has classified the AfD at the national level as a suspected extremism case since 2021. Shortly after the piece was published online, the editor of the opinion section, Eva Marie Kogel, used the US tech mogul’s own platform to post on X that she had submitted her resignation. “I always enjoyed heading the opinion department at Welt and Wams. Today a text by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. Yesterday I submitted my resignation after printing,” she posted. She included a link to the Musk commentary article. The AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance and, like incoming president Donald Trump in relation to the US, is calling for mass deportations from Germany. Earlier in December, Musk not only posted in favor of AfD but the party’s hard line on immigration appeared to resonate with the incoming US vice-president, JD Vance, MSNBC reported. Senior Welt Group figures weighed in on Saturday. “Democracy and journalism thrive on freedom of expression. This includes dealing with polarising positions and classifying them journalistically,” the newspaper’s editor-in-chief designate, Jan Philipp Burgard, and Ulf Poschardt, who takes over as publisher on 1 January, told Reuters. They said discussion about Musk’s piece, which had about 340 comments several hours after it was published, was “very revealing”. Underneath Musk’s commentary, the newspaper published a response by Burgard. “Musk’s diagnosis is correct, but his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally false,” he wrote, referencing the AfD’s desire to leave the European Union and seek rapprochement with Russia as well as appease China. Musk and Weidel both later posted a link to the article on X. The AfD backing from Musk, who also defended his right to weigh in on German politics due to his “significant investments”, comes as Germans are set to vote on 23 February after a coalition government led by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed late this fall. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a centre-right or centre-left majority, but Germany’s mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level."
"Dominique Pelicot will not appeal against his conviction for drugging and raping his wife and inviting strangers to rape her, his lawyer has said. Béatrice Zavarro said the former electrician, 72, who was jailed for the maximum 20 years this month, wished to spare his now ex-wife, Gisèle Pelicot, a new ordeal but admitted there was also the risk a new trial in front of a public jury could mean a longer prison sentence. Pelicot and the 50 others who were all found guilty of rape or sexual assault after a three-and-a-half-month trial have until midnight on Monday to lodge an appeal. A statement from public prosecutor confirmed that 17 people had so far appealed against their convictions, adding that a new trial would be held in Nîmes towards the end of next year. Gisèle Pelicot, 72, a retired logistics manager, believes she may have been raped more than 200 times by her husband and other men between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after filming up the skirts of female shoppers in a supermarket near the couple’s home in the Provençal town of Mazan. Detectives subsequently found tens of thousands of videos of the abuse on his phone and a hard drive. On Monday, Zavarro said Dominique Pelicot had decided not to appeal against his conviction because to do so would “force Gisèle into a new ordeal and new confrontations, which [he] rejects”. Appealing against the guilty judgment, when Pelicot admitted the charges, would involve “running an unnecessary risk”, she added, as the accusations could be made more serious in the appeal court, where the case would be held in front of a public jury, potentially leading to a longer prison term. “It is time to put an end to this judicially,” Zavarro said on Monday. The marathon rape trial in Avignon was heard by a panel of five professional magistrates. The appeal court, which sits in the southern city of Nîmes, will require a new full trial within the next year. Gisèle Pelicot is not required to attend the appeal hearing but her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, indicated she was ready to do so. “She has told us she will be there. Maybe not every day but she says she will go,” he said. She became an international feminist figurehead after insisting the trial be held in open court and the videos of her abuse shown in order that “shame changes sides”. The trial has caused much soul-searcing in France and calls to tighten French rape laws, including introducing the concept of “consent”, which is absent. The trial also threw a spotlight on attitudes towards the rape and sexual abuse of women in France, where 94% of reported rape cases are dropped without any action. “From Gisèle Pelicot’s point of view, there is no sentence that will give her back what she has lost,” Babonneau said. “All Gisèle Pelicot wanted is to have the accused convicted for what they did to her. As for the personal sentences, she respects the decision of the court and finds no solace in them.”"
"Work has begun to conserve and digitise one of the oldest paper documents still in existence on the island of Ireland. The ecclesiastical register, which dates back to the medieval period, is about 650 years old. It belonged to the former archbishop of Armagh Milo Sweteman. Its delicate pages are being repaired by experts at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni) as part of an initiative to rejuvenate and preserve some of the island of Ireland’s most important historical texts. Ecclesiastical registers contain copies or drafts of documents created by the archbishops’ administration work, including legal papers, official letters, correspondence, receipts and wills. The register belonging to Sweteman dates to his time in the senior clerical role from 1361 to 1380. Conservation work on the register of archbishop John Swayne, dated from 1418 to 1438, has already been completed and a digitised copy, along with a translated summary, are now available online. The conservation work on the Swayne books involved carefully detaching bindings dating from the 17th century, gently washing all the paper folios and then consolidating each piece of paper with a weak gelatine solution. Tears and losses in the paper were infilled with Japanese kozo paper before the books were rebound using 17th-century binding material. The work now under way on the Sweteman register involves the need to repair damage that resulted from previous conservation efforts dating back to the start of the 20th century when tracing paper was placed on the pages in an attempt to preserve them. The tracing paper was acidic and actually accelerated the corrosion of the ink and paper. It is now being removed using a specialist gel before being subjected to a low-pressure washing process. The same kozo paper and wheat starch paste repairs used for Swayne’s register are then being undertaken. Similar work is being carried out on a third register, dated between 1400 and 1418, that belonged to former archbishop Nicholas Fleming. Sarah Graham, head of conservation at Proni, explained that paper was extremely rare on the island of Ireland when the registers were compiled. It was a period that just predated the invention of the printing press when parchment from animal skins was still the preferred writing material. “Paper that pre-dates 1450 is particularly rare, it didn’t occur in Ireland for a couple of centuries after the register of Milo Sweteman or the register of John Swayne were completed,” said Graham. “We’ve done some research into the watermarks and know that the paper came from Italy and from Spain.” Graham said it was likely the archbishops imported the paper to Ireland during their travels around Europe. The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland is an effort to partially recreate the rich historical archive that was destroyed when the Public Record Office of Ireland in Dublin was set alight in June 1922 in the beginning of the Irish civil war. Graham emphasised the importance of preserving the centuries-old documents that do still exist. “The work that we do in conservation more broadly is really important to stabilise the collections so that they’re available to the public now, but they’re also available for generations to come, so that future generations are able to understand where they come from, what their history is, and the primary source of material is here and available to them,” she said."
"South Korea’s intelligence agency has reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine has died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces. Seoul’s spy agency earlier on Friday confirmed Ukrainian reports that an injured North Korean soldier had been captured by Ukrainian forces, in what was likely to have been the first capture of its kind since Pyongyang sent combat forces to bolster Russian forces in the war. The South Korean national intelligence service said in a statement: “Through real-time information sharing with an allied country’s intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured.” The agency later said the captured soldier had died from his injuries. A photo of the soldier, who looked gaunt and appeared to have been injured, circulated on the Telegram messaging app, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. In his nightly video address on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said North Korean troops fighting in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s president said Russian troops were doing everything to ensure that North Korean soldiers were not taken prisoner by Kyiv. He said some North Korean soldiers had been captured by Ukrainian forces, but were hurt so badly they could not be saved. Earlier the Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that special forces had captured the soldier in the Kursk region, where Ukraine has seized and held some territory. The outlet did not say when the capture took place, and there has been no confirmation from officials in Ukraine or North Korea, where the state media have not referred to the deployment of the country’s troops. Militarnyi said that if it was confirmed, the soldier would be the first North Korean combatant to have been taken by Ukrainian forces. As many as 11,000 soldiers from North Korea have been deployed to help Russia, months after Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defence pact that committed each country to come to the other’s aid if attacked. While the North could gain valuable battlefield experience, its poorly trained soldiers, fighting in unfamiliar territory, have quickly been exposed to the dangers of combat. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, known as the GUR, said on Thursday that North Korean troops were suffering heavy losses in the fighting in Kursk and facing logistical difficulties as a result of Ukrainian attacks. The GUR said Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka had inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units and that North Korean troops also faced supply issues, including shortages of drinking water. This week Zelenskyy claimed that more than 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in the Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties. On Friday a White House spokesperson said 1,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the past week alone. “It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences,” John Kirby said. He described the North Korean troops’ offensive as “massed, dismounted assaults” and said Joe Biden was likely to approve another security assistance package for Ukraine in coming days. The deployment of North Korean soldiers marked a dramatic escalation in the war, which began almost three years ago, as the Kremlin turned to its ally to boost its forces. It was also seen as an attempt by Putin to broaden the conflict through the direct involvement in fighting of a third country. Slovakia, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that it would host peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, despite Ukraine’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Putin. On Thursday the Russian president said it was “acceptable” for the country to become a “platform” for dialogue over the conflict, which the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said he could end after he takes office in January. That prospect has raised concerns in Kyiv that a settlement could be imposed on terms favourable to Moscow, as Ukraine struggles on the battlefield."
"At first, there seemed nothing to be afraid of. Joe Giardina, his wife, Evanna, and their 16-year-old son, Paul, were taking in the picture-perfect waters of Patong bay as they ate breakfast in their Phuket beachfront hotel on Boxing Day morning in 2004. “We were admiring the view and all of a sudden the water disappeared,” says Giardina, 67, speaking from his home in Rosanna, Victoria. The water level had dropped so quickly that fish were floundering on the exposed seabed. But rather than sensing any threat, curious onlookers made their way to the beach. “The locals thought, ‘This is fantastic.’ They were running around picking the fish up.” Now Giardina knows it’s a sign to flee to higher ground. About 550km to the south-west, a magnitude 9.15 earthquake had struck 30km below the Andaman Sea, triggering what would become the most devastating tsunami in history. Paul was one of 26 Australians among more than 230,000 people whose lives were lost across 14 countries – in some impact zones, the waves reached up to 3o metres above sea level. Twenty years on, Giardina’s memories of the disaster are as vivid as they were in its immediate aftermath. “It really feels like it was only yesterday,” he says of that initially deceptive morning. Within about half an hour the sea had returned to its normal level and settled, then it began to swirl, gently stirring up the sand below. Almost simultaneously, the nearby pier started to float away. A small amount of water – no more than 20cm – washed on to the road bordering the restaurant. “It didn’t look dangerous – we said, ‘We’re going to get wet,’” Giardina remembers. But when a car was washed towards the hotel, he began to run, leading Paul by the hand and then attempting to protect his son by holding him against a pillar inside the hotel. Seconds later, a waist-high wall of water hit them from behind, throwing them over an internal wall and ripping Giardina’s clothes from his body. Cars and tables slammed into the building as everything in the path of the 800km/h wave was lifted and flung high. Something hit Giardina on the back of the head and he went under, losing hold of Paul. Giardina found himself pushed horizontally against the outer corner of the hotel when a large object – a car, a fridge, he’ll never know – pinned his left arm to the wall. “I’m trying with my right hand to get out, get around the corner, to push away whatever was holding me. And I just couldn’t get there. I was underwater and I held my breath for as long as I could. The last thing I recall is just opening my mouth and that was it. The lights went off.” Today, he still finds consolation in the thought that Paul, whose body was found in a makeshift morgue by Joe’s brothers-in-law three days later, might have experienced something similar. “I can only hope – and it’s terrible – but I can only hope that Paul went through the same experience,” he says. “There was no suffering.” The Giardinas had weighed up whether to visit Thailand or Bali for Paul’s first overseas trip. Paul had Down’s syndrome and, while physically high-functioning, was unable to care for himself. Phuket seemed a safer option two years after Bali’s terrorist attacks and the family – Paul’s sister, two years his senior, stayed in Australia – chose to celebrate Christmas at Patong’s Seaview hotel, where Paul played ball in the swimming pool and was photographed smiling with Santa. Joe and Evanna called their affectionate son the “love machine”. “Twice in his short life, he had open heart surgery. The second time, he’d had a valve replaced in his heart, and when he’s woken up from the surgery, what was his first comment? It wasn’t tears and crying and screaming, it was ‘What happened?’ There wouldn’t be too many of us behaving that way,” Joe Giardina says, laughing. Giardina was found inside the hotel, lying prone and headfirst down a flight of steps on the third storey. His position saved his life: water drained out of his body. Initially deemed unlikely to survive, he was eventually taken to Bangkok hospital in Phuket, where the pain from his extensive injuries was numbed by the fear that he had lost Paul and Evanna. His wife was found unhurt and later reunited with him – she had ridden the wave to the hotel, grabbed hold of a balcony and miraculously avoided being sucked back out to sea. When Giardina was medevaced to Melbourne, the doctors’ first job was to flush the sand out of his lungs. “The one thing that it has taught me is how quickly it can all come to an end. You appreciate every day when you go through something like that,” he says, describing the speed at which the morning went from one of tropical calm to earth-shattering calamity. He and Evanna are grateful to have found Paul’s body among Thailand’s 5,400 victims, “because if we hadn’t, I know that there would be a sense of ‘He could be out there still’. And where do you start? We would have been walking the streets looking for him. And that would have been …” He pauses. “How do you cope with that?” It’s not accidental that when visitors to the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial take in the wave-shaped sculpture on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, they are also facing the water. Giardina instigated the memorial and requested that its aspect include water. Its unveiling in December 2015 was the first time Joe and Evanna had met all 25 of the other Australian victims’ families, after a 10-year process involving three governments. It’s given them a place where they can remember Paul, and this 26 December they plan to be there again, with their son in spirit. But part of Paul will always remain in Phuket. Joe and Evanna returned to Patong in October 2005 and again on the first anniversary of the disaster, and Joe has visited Thailand many times since, partly so that the tsunami does not dictate how he lives. “It’s part of the healing. I feel like part of Paul is there. If I didn’t go back, the tsunami would win. It’s taken my son’s life, and now we’re not going to go to the beach any more because of the tsunami? I didn’t want that either. It’s a rare event, but when it happens, it causes damage, and we’ve just got to accept it.” Now he can speak about the tsunami without crying – but it is a work in progress. “As humans, we learn to cope with tragedies. You don’t forget the pain, but you learn to live with the pain. We had 16 beautiful years with Paul, but it’s the journey of life. Life is what it is and you’ve just got to accept it. And we’re grateful we were able to spend 16 years with him.”"
"The United Nations chief has denounced the “escalation” in hostilities between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Israel, calling IDF strikes on targets including at the airport in Sana’a “especially alarming” after it came under attack while the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane. Israel struck multiple targets linked to the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen on Thursday, including the international airport in the capital, Sana’a. Houthi media said at least six people were killed. A spokesperson for UN secretary general, António Guterres, said in a statement: “The secretary general condemns the escalation between Yemen and Israel. Israeli airstrikes today on Sana’a international airport, the Red Sea ports and power stations in Yemen are especially alarming … “Today’s airstrikes follow around a year of escalatory actions by the Houthis in the Red Sea and the region that threaten civilians, regional stability and freedom of maritime navigation.” The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a social media post on Thursday that he was about to board a plane at the airport when it came under aerial attack. A crew member on the plane was injured, he said, and at least two people were reported killed at the airport. “The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave. My UN and @WHO colleagues and I are safe. Our heartfelt condolences to the families whose loved ones lost their lives in the attack.” Tedros said he had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of UN staff detained by the Houthis and assess the humanitarian situation. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Agence France-Presse on whether they were aware of Tedros’ presence at the time. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Thursday afternoon that Israel’s air force attacked Houthi targets on the coastline and in Sanaa, adding: “We are determined to cut off this terrorist arm of Iran’s evil axis. We will persist in this until we complete the task.” Netanyahu said in an interview with Channel 14 that Israel was only at the beginning of its campaign against the Houthis. “We are just getting started with them,” he said. Houthis have repeatedly fired drones and missiles towards Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli military said that in addition to striking the airport, it also hit military infrastructure at the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib on Yemen’s west coast. It also attacked the country’s Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations. The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency said that three people were killed in the strikes on the airport and three were killed in Hodeidah, while 40 others were wounded in the attacks. Later on Thursday, the Houthis said they were ready to respond quickly to the attack and meet “escalation with escalation”, Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported. The Houthi transport minister told Saba that both the airport and Hodeidah port would resume normal operations from Friday. More than a year of Houthi attacks has disrupted international shipping routes, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys that have in turn stoked fears over global inflation. The UN security council is due to meet on Monday over the Houthi attacks on Israel, Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel’s military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse"
"Paul Volcker, who has died aged 92, was the most eminent financial statesman of his generation, the sworn enemy of the abuse of finance in any of its manifestations. That could be indulging inflation as the financial outcome of governments and society living beyond their means, or investment banks deluding themselves they had uncovered the alchemy of risk-free lending through the issuance of ever more complex financial derivatives. His twin mantras were that finance should be the servant not the master of economy and society. And that good government is an indispensable component of a good society, in particular keeping the temptations of clever-clever finance at bay. Sound money and good government went hand in hand. He practised what he preached, seizing the opportunity to embody his beliefs when the moment arrived. Standing over 6ft 7in, and a lover of over-sized cigars and fly-fishing, he represented the best of New England liberalism – genial, good humoured and steely. From August 1979 to August 1987 he was chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the US’s central bank, appointed by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and and reappointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. In the early part of that period he crushed inflation out of the US economy. Just 18 months after he was appointed he had the courage to raise interest rates to 20% – a rate never seen before – prompting mass protests as the US economy plunged into recession. But he held firm and succeeded, inflation peaking at 14.8% before falling back to 3% by 1983. The foundations had been laid for sustained economic recovery and in the process warranting the principle that central bank independence is a crucial precondition for robust monetary policy. It was one of the defining moments in US monetary policy history, winning him plaudits not only for his resilience in the face of near universal criticism but also from the small but fast growing influential band of free market, “monetarist” economists who believed that control of the money supply using high interest rates was the sole means to curb inflation – not any kind of government interference into the market processes for setting wages and prices. Volcker temporarily was their hero. But they misjudged the man. Volcker never bought the proposition that the market was magical or that there could be a systematic relationship between the growth of the money supply and inflation. Rather he was intuitively suspicious of the short term and predatory instincts of most financial market participants, which lead to volatile and unpredictable market movements, and intuitively suspicious of the mania for dismantling the New Deal rules and regulations that restrained their worst types of behaviours that “free market“ economists said were inhibiting the efficiency of the US financial system. His willingness to be austere in raising interest rates so high was because he knew dear money worked reliably in squeezing inflation – not because he was an advocate of a hyper-free-market economy. He would be equally austere in resisting the siren calls to deregulate finance in the name of freeing up the market. It would come to no good. Nor did it. Volcker was a critic of successive rounds of financial deregulation after he left office, saying that the only useful financial innovation he had encountered was the invention of the ATM – cash dispensing machines. Even before the 2008-09 financial crisis he was warning that the invention of mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps were inherently unstable, in effect transferring risk to the Federal Reserve, which would be compelled to underwrite the financial system if the markets ever lost confidence in them. So it proved as the financial crisis broke for precisely the reasons about which he had warned – unlike his successor Alan Greenspan, who had enthusiastically and uncritically embraced financial deregulation. President Obama appointed him head of the president’s economic advisory board in 2009 in the midst of the crisis. There he argued that the emergence of banks that were too big to fail, so forcing central bank rescues, was morally and economically insupportable and they should be broken up. If that was politically impossible then at least commercial banks who took deposits from the ordinary public should be banned from trading in high-risk financial derivatives on their own account – the so-called Volcker rule. Obama adopted the proposal and it became section 619 of the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act; banks cannot own, invest in or sponsor hedge funds, private equity funds or other trading operations for their own use. Volcker had once again made an indelible mark on the US financial system, and influenced British thinking in the legal obligation to ringfence commercial and investment bank operations. Born in Cape May, on the southern tip of New Jersey, Paul Jr was the son of Paul Volcker, a civil engineer, and his wife, Alma (nee Klippel); his grandparents were all German immigrants. He grew up in the conventional world of 1930s and 40s America – going to high school, attending the local Lutheran church, but already showing an interest in public affairs and a precocious intelligence . He gained a degree in history, economics and political science at Princeton University (1949), and went on to do a master’s in political economy and government at Harvard, and to study at the London school of Economics. In 1952 he joined the New York Federal Reserve as an economist. A career alternating between Wall Street and the US Treasury in ever more responsible jobs then followed before fatefully he caught the eye of President Carter in 1979. He was a convinced believer in international collaboration, helping to fashion the Plaza accords in 1986 when Germany and Japan agreed to allow their currencies to appreciate, so limiting their trade imbalances with the US. This vital adjustment, he knew, would not come from market forces spontaneously but from intergovernmental collaboration. He was a founder of the Trilateral Commission, to foster relations between Japan, western Europe and north America, and regular attender at the Bilderberg meetings of leaders and experts from Europe and north America, believing that the key international players had to understand each other better. Towards the end of his life this believer in the power, capacity and importance of good government became increasingly concerned about the collapse of trust in government, founding the Volcker Alliance to advance the understanding of – and education for – careers in public service. In 1954 he married Barbara Bahnson; she died in 1998. In 2010 he married Anke Dening, and she survives him, along with James and Janice, the children of his first marriage. • Paul Adolph Volcker, central banker and economist, born 5 September 1927; died 8 December 2019"
"High street sales slumped in November in the weakest period for consumer spending for more than a year, as shoppers reined in their spending in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales across Britain fell by 0.6% when compared with the previous month, with only household goods stores reporting growth. In a sign of the stress facing retailers, the quantity of goods bought dropped by 0.4% in the three months to November compared with the previous three months, the first decline since April 2018. Annual growth in sales also slowed to 1%, mainly because of a slump in spending in non-food stores. The latest figures from the high street and online suggest heavy discounting around Black Friday failed to tempt consumers to part with their cash in one of the worst periods for retailers in recent decades. Analysts said unsettled weather, political and economic uncertainty over Brexit and the snap election, and consumers leaving their shopping to the last minute in hope of bigger discounts, all had an impact last month. High street retailers are also struggling with rising wage bills and the cost of business rates, as well as tough competition as consumers switch to online shopping. Recognising the difficulties on the high street, the government said it was committed to a “fundamental review” of business rates and announced new measures to help independent retailers in the Queen’s speech on Thursday. The measures include a 50% discount on business rates for small to medium-sized high street properties including shops, pubs and restaurants with a rateable value of less than £51,000, up from a 33% discount at present. The discount is also being extended to cinemas and music venues. The plans are unlikely to do much to help troubled major retailers such as House of Fraser or Debenhams as retail chains are not eligible for the discount and neither are large department stores. November was the fourth month in a row without growth in retail spending – the longest stretch since the mid-90s. The ONS said Black Friday was not included in the figures, as the US-inspired day of shopping discounts fell late in the month, on 29 November. It said its seasonally adjusted estimates accounted for this shift in timing. However, analysts said the timing of Black Friday could have had an impact and probably distorted November’s spending figures. The ONS said Black Friday spending patterns would probably influence its December release, with only early promotions captured in the November estimates. Duncan Brewer, a retail partner at the consultancy Oliver Wyman, said political uncertainty had lifted since the election and unemployment remained low, in a positive signal for consumer spending. However, he warned that at least two high street shopping chains were likely to go bust next year and about 100,000 jobs were likely to be cut across the sector. He said: “The slump in retail sales over November goes to show that despite the momentous shopping holiday of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, discounting periods are not an effective way of getting people into the shops.”"
"No one has dug into the vaults of the Bank of England and pilfered a gold bar, but security breaches for a central bank in the 21st-century age of information do not come much worse than this. Hedge funds have managed to gain access to an audio feed of the governor’s press conferences, thereby securing for themselves an advantage of a few seconds over viewers of the slightly delayed TV broadcast. In modern frantic markets, seconds can matter. The misuse of the audio feed by an unnamed third-party supplier is “wholly unacceptable”, said the Bank after the report by the Times. The governor, Mark Carney, will be squirming with embarrassment. He arrived in 2013 on a mission to modernise the Bank’s operations and information security was top of the list. Now Threadneedle Street stands accused of gross naivety. The audio feed was designed as a back-up in case the TV system failed, but the potential for mischief should have been obvious. The Bank left a back door, if not wide open, then significantly ajar. The call for somebody’s resignation will be loud. No hedge fund or trader, it should be said, had advance knowledge of the Bank’s actual policy decisions, which are the main event on these stage-managed occasions. Interest rate decisions, for example, are announced to the world on the stroke of midday, and the full set of accompanying documents is published simultaneously. Journalists are allowed to read the contents in advance only if they are locked in the bowels of the Bank until midday in a secure room with no wifi or mobile phone signal. The security breach concerns only the press conferences, which start at 12.30pm. A consolation for the Bank, one could argue, is that Carney’s press conferences tend to be spectacularly dull. He’s in the business of explaining reports that are in the public domain by the time he speaks and he tends not to stray far from his mental script. For ordinary mortals, a five-second informational advantage might be useless. Even five minutes to wade through Carney’s sub-clauses might not yield nuggets to indicate if the pound should be moving up, down or sideways. The trouble is, there is a breed of hedge funds that does not operate like ordinary mortals do. They’re pursuing fast action and even the possibility of morsels of information count in their world. Some even run artificial intelligence computer programmes to alight on specific words or phrases and then trade instantly, and perhaps only for a brief second, on what they learn. This type of hedge fund may also be interested in what Carney doesn’t say, as much as what he does, in response to a question. Such strategies seek only marginal gains, and success is clearly not guaranteed, but a central bank simply cannot give anybody any theoretical opportunity to get ahead of the market. The fallout from this affair will be fascinating. The Financial Conduct Authority will have to decide if the third-party supplier (which surely won’t remain unidentified for long) has merely breached its contract with the Bank or has committed market abuse, which is a serious regulatory matter. The market abuse question also applies to the hedge funds, though the FCA will face an obvious difficulty in proving that a trade was placed because of access to the audio feed rather than something unrelated. This could be groundbreaking territory. The judgment on the Bank of England, by contrast, is already clear. It looks amateurish."
"Saturday was not so super for retailers last weekend, as numbers visiting high streets and shopping centres fell by nearly 8% compared with the previous year. With some retailers accepting online orders as late as Christmas Eve, shoppers now have many more choices about the way they shop and often hang on for last-minute bargains. More than a third (36%) of Brits have left gift-buying until the last few days before Christmas, according to Argos. It said 10% more men than women leave gift-buying until very late, with the most popular gift bought in its stores on Christmas Eve last year being an electric toothbrush. John Lewis expected novelty socks and gadgets such as airpods and smart speakers to be its most popular last-minute items. Monday was expected to be the busiest day for food retailers with Waitrose expecting to sell 214,000kg of sprouts in the final days before Christmas and 250% more quails eggs than usual. The lower turnout recorded by shopper monitoring firm Springboard on Saturday –traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year – came despite a flurry of discounts from retailers in an effort to tempt bargain hunters after a difficult trading year. Industry experts said the plethora of promotions on offer since November, and particularly over the Black Friday discount period at the end of November, meant many had spent their money early or were underwhelmed by further price cuts. Late last week Topshop and Miss Selfridge increased their discounts to up to 60%, from 40% and 50% respectively earlier in the week, while Jigsaw, Peacocks and House of Fraser increased their price cuts to 50%, matching Debenhams, Hobbs and Oasis, which had deepened their discounts. Marks &amp; Spencer also added knitwear to its price-cutting pile, offering 40% off its key seasonal category, as well as a half-price on beauty gifts offer. The difficult trading is expected to bring further distress for retailers in early 2020 after numerous administrations and store closures this year. The number of retailers in financial distress in the final quarter of the year has risen 1.4% on the same period last year to 27,000, according to data from the corporate recovery firm Begbies Traynor. Fashion chains are among the worst affected, with the number in distress increasing by 21% in the past three years to 3,355. Online retailers are not immune to the slowdown, with the number in trouble up by 65% in the past three years, to more than 9,000."
"The Bank of England restructured its security department and lost multiple senior employees in charge of protecting some of Britain’s most critical financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal. After the central bank admitted that hedge funds had gained early access to its market-moving press conferences via a backup audio feed, multiple former employees contacted the Observer to warn that the Bank was struggling with the departure of key staff responsible for protecting it against external threats. The sources said at least 20 of the Bank’s staff tasked with information security had left or been reassigned elsewhere within the bank within the past year, raising questions over the protection of the nation’s payment systems and other critical infrastructure vital for the British financial system. The Observer was able to verify 13 of these departures using information from social media and other sources. The revelations come at a sensitive time for the Bank as it prepares for the handover of power in March from Mark Carney, the outgoing governor, to Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Threadneedle Street has also played a central role in efforts to improve the safety and integrity of the financial system since the 2008 banking collapse, including warning the industry to improve its cyber and information security operations. It is responsible for key parts of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including the payments systems that carry every bank transfer made in Britain, the wages of millions of people, cheques, and payments between businesses of all sizes. On an average day in 2018, the Bank’s real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) settled transactions worth £651bn. According to the former employees, the Bank’s chief information security officer and two deputies have left in the past year. Multiple former employees described the organisation as beset by budget cuts before Carney’s departure, against a backdrop of concerns over cost efficiency. They said there were problems with staffing given the departures and low staff morale. Much of the disquiet stemmed from a move to dismantle the Bank’s “security and privacy” directorate, the people said. The team, part of the central services division, previously had oversight over cyber, personnel and physical security matters, as well as privacy. Staff and responsibilities were instead spread across other parts of the organisation. It is understood that many of the people now sit under the Bank’s technology, security and risk directorates, in a move designed to make the organisation safer. The Bank has about 70 cybersecurity professionals. A Bank of England spokeswoman said: “The Bank operates the highest standard of information security and is confident in our ability to recognise cyber threats and defend our systems appropriately. Earlier this year, the Bank completed a review of its central services target operating model and, as part of that, reinforced the arrangements for first- and second-line information security. This change was fully supported by the Bank’s audit and risk committee.” The Bank admitted late on Wednesday night that it had suffered a security breach, with a provider of a backup audio feed of the governor’s market-sensitive press conferences selling early access to unnamed investors without its knowledge. Those investors could have used the few seconds’ advantage to profit. It was alerted to the breach by the Times newspaper, conducted a rapid internal investigation and passed the matter to the FCA. The City watchdog has confirmed it is investigating the issue, and it is understood that Bailey will recuse himself from all discussions of the matter to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest. The Bank’s chief operating officer, Joanna Place, is the most senior manager responsible for physical and information security, and faced calls to resign from a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, Danny Blanchflower, following the breach. Place, who was appointed in July 2017, reports directly to the governor, and has an equal status to the Bank’s deputy governors. Multiple sources said the Bank was under pressure to cut the budget of the central services division, which was managed by Place. They said the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned in December 2018 that the Bank needed to deliver better value for money. Place told the Commons’ public accounts committee in January that the Bank did not “have any gaps in cybersecurity”. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, resigned little over a month later. Multiple other security experts followed him. A spokeswoman for the Bank said Rogers resigned on 23 February and that Place was not aware he was going to quit when she gave evidence on 21 January. At the hearing, Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, expressed surprise at Place’s answer, given the difficulties other public-sector organisations had with recruiting and retaining cyber security staff, and asked again if there were any vacancies. Place responded: “Offhand, I do not know whether we have any vacancies, but we do not have a problem with recruiting and we do not have a problem with retention in cyber, either.” There was widespread unease within the Bank following her testimony, multiple sources said, and in the months after her appearance the cybersecurity function suffered the outflow of staff. The public sector struggles to retain staff in cybersecurity roles because of intense competition from the higher-paying private sector. However, the reputation of the Bank and its important role in protecting financial stability are attractive for potential candidates, and the sources said they believed it was in the public interest to shed light on the problems it was facing. A Bank of England spokesperson said: “The incident relating to the misuse of a backup audio feed from the Bank’s press conferences by a third-party supplier, which the Bank has referred to the Financial Conduct Authority for further investigation, was not a cyber security issue.”"
"UK high streets have shed more than 140,000 jobs this year as store closures and retail failures made 2019 one of the most challenging years in a generation. More than 2,750 jobs were lost every week, according to a detailed analysis by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) published today. It predicts the picture will worsen in 2020, unless the government intervenes, with high business rates one of the factors blamed for accelerating chain store closures. Prof Joshua Bamfield, the CRR’s director, said retail was in crisis owing to high costs, low levels of profitability and sales moving online. “These problems are felt by most businesses operating from physical stores in high streets or shopping malls,” Bamfield said. “The low growth in consumer spending since 2015 has meant that the growth in online sales has come at the expense of the high street.” The CRR said 38,100 of the jobs lost this year were down to retail chains going bust with Karen Millen and Coast among 2019’s high profile casualties. Another 26,500 roles were shed through company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a controversial insolvency procedure that has been used by the likes of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group and Debenhams to shed loss-making stores. Another 78,600 jobs were axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small shops simply shutting for good. Marks &amp; Spencer is among the big names closing stores while House of Fraser, which is part of Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, has also been shutting outlets. A total of 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019, according to CRR’s calculations, up by more than a fifth on 2018’s 117,400. The CRR also calculated that 16,073 shops closed around the UK in 2019, or around 61 every working day. That was an increase on the 14,583 shops which closed in 2018. A separate study looking at how the UK labour market had changed over the past decade said the rise of online shopping had eliminated 289,000 “traditional” high street roles. Eight out of 10 of these entry-level retail jobs – positions like sales assistant and checkout operator – were held by women, according to the RSA Future Work Centre. The thinktank is part of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the charity run by Matthew Taylor who authored a gig economy review for Theresa May when she was prime minister. Alan Lockey, who heads the thinktank, said: “The carnage on the high street has hollowed out many jobs traditionally held by women, but areas of growth related to e-commerce, such as van driving, are going more to men. This is having a profound effect on individuals, families and society.” Today one in every five pounds spent at the shops is online – more than double the level at the start of the decade. The resulting shift in labour markets are stark. There are now 166,000 fewer check-out staff, shelf fillers and sales assistants than at the start of the 2010s, according to RSA’s analysis of official employment data, while the pool of bank and post office clerks has shrunk by 65,000 as branches closed. By comparison there are 102,000 more van drivers and 161,000 more administration roles. Lockey said the decline of the high street was the most dramatic factor affecting the UK’s jobs landscape, even though austerity, which had eliminated 109,000 public sector administrators, also loomed large. Despite the reckoning taking place the retail sector remains the UK’s biggest private sector employer with a workforce of around 3 million. Its decline contrasts with a wider picture showing record levels of employment as former shop workers find alternative work in restaurants, hotels and as care workers. The RSA study showed a near 78,000 rise in the number of care workers. “The employment figures show that over the last decade the economy has been good at creating jobs but low skilled workers in the retail sector have been pushed from pillar to post. The alternative jobs they are getting are often low paid and do not provide good security, leading to working poverty,” Lockey added. The important Christmas trading period appears to have brought little respite for struggling retail chains. Trading during November and December was marred by heavy discounting as stores sought to tempt out shoppers put off by the uncertainty around Brexit and the 12 December general election. The post-Christmas sales got off to a disappointing start too, attracting smaller crowds than in previous years."
"The embattled US aircraft maker Boeing has reportedly sent US regulators “troubling communications” related to the development of the 737 MAX – on the same day that the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was forced to step aside. According to a senior Boeing executive, the documents include new messages from Mark Forkner, a senior company test pilot who complained of “egregious” erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of Boeing’s MCAS anti-stall system, and referred to “Jedi mind tricks” to persuade regulators to approve the plane. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Seattle Times that the Forkner communications contain the same kind of “trash talking” about Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulators as the earlier messages released in October. The release is likely to deepen the sense of crisis enveloping Boeing, which has taken more than $8bn in costs and lost more than 20% of its market value since the 737 variant was grounded in March following two crashes. Last week, the company said it would temporarily halt production of the troubled jet. Forkner, meanwhile, has reportedly hired his own criminal defense lawyers and invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid turning over records to the US Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal inquiry into the company’s handling of the 737 Max’s development. It was Forkner who requested that information about MCAS be omitted from flight manuals and pilot training, rendering the pilots of both the doomed Lion Air and Ethiopian flights helpless when the system kicked in, pushing the plane’s nose down repeatedly until they ultimately lost control. But the timing of the latest information release is likely to increase anger surrounding Boeing’s handling of the crisis, even as a new CEO, David Calhoun, takes the reins early next year. In a statement released on Monday, Boeing said that under the “new leadership”, Boeing “will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA, other global regulators and its customers”. But the latest drop of documents could complicate those intentions, and further challenge its relationship with regulators. The aerospace giant already angered the FAA by failing to turn over the Forkner messages for eight months because of the criminal investigation into how the plane was originally approved for service. “The FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery,” the regulator said in a statement on 18 October. The regulator was also reportedly further vexed by Muilenburg’s predictions that the 737 Max would imminently be cleared to return to service, which it regarded as placing pressure on the agency to approve Boeing’s MCAS software fix even as it was taking a hit to its reputation for being too cozy with the plane maker. Last month, Muilenburg was reportedly called to a meeting in Washington with the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, and dressed down for applying perceived pressure on the regulator. An internal FAA memo written by Dickson and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, said the FAA would not work to any schedule. Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020. Muilenburg’s efforts to take responsibility for the 737 debacle, and to apologize for its tragic consequences, fell flat with lawmakers, the public and grieving families, costing him his job. During congressional testimony, Muilenburg offered muddled responses to lawmaker’s demands for clarity on the development and approval of the 737 Max, and why it had not been immediately grounded after the first crash in Indonesia. “You’re not trying to Jedi mind-trick us here today on this committee?” the Democrat Dina Titus challenged. Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to receive $26.5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package. His payout could reach as high as $58.5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 annually and Boeing stock worth another $13.3m. In a statement on Monday, Boeing’s board said it had decided that “a change in leadership” was necessary to restore confidence. But it chose not to fire the executive, allowing him to keep his pay package and saving Boeing from the impression its most senior executive had done something wrong. But according to subsequent reports, it was not just the handling of 737 Max crisis or squabbles with the FAA that ultimately doomed Muilenburg. Last week, a high-profile launch of Boeing’s space capsule went awry."
"The Chinese proverb is “be careful what you wish for”. My own adapted version is “be careful what you vote for”. I make no apology for having devoted so many columns to what on Thursday became the lost cause of Remain. The pro-European cause in this country has, alas, suffered from a colossal failure of leadership. The failure to make the case for our EU membership goes back a long way, as does the drip-drip of the vile anti-European campaign in the Murdoch press, and the obvious suspects in other sections of the media. The sequence of events was well brought out in Denis MacShane’s prophetic book Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe in 2015. (What lies in store is outlined both in MacShane’s latest volume, Brexiternity, and Sir Ivan Rogers’s recent magisterial lecture at Glasgow University.) As MacShane wrote in 2015: “The referendum on Europe is not on the benefits or cost of EU membership, but a wider protest about economic and social change which appears inside Britain to produce as many losers as winners.” It was always easy to blame “Brussels” for policies that became controversial, even when those policies were initiated by successive UK governments themselves. One of the leading perpetrators of lies about Europe was, of course, the Telegraph’s former Brussels correspondent himself: Boris Johnson. Johnson is such a master of what his putative hero Winston Churchill called “terminological inexactitudes” that nothing he claimed during the campaign or the morning of his victory can be taken at face value. “One-nation Conservatism”? Governing for the interests of those northerners who have “lent him their votes”? Pull the other one! How does that compare with his plans for deregulation, closer alignment with Trump’s America, and the opportunities for profiting from Brexit to which his financial backers look forward? As Rogers said in his Glasgow lecture, Johnson’s claim that we will “not suffer any downside in terms of market access into easily our biggest market for goods and services … is clearly untrue. It does not get any truer through endless repetition.” The nation has been the victim of a gigantic con trick on the part of the Leave campaign. The nonsensical propaganda about “getting Brexit done” was finally too much for the counsellor in the British embassy in Washington who resigned recently because she could no longer face peddling a misleading line. But back to failures of leadership: Jeremy Corbyn’s failure was on an epic scale. Reputedly a Leaver himself, he made a huge mistake in thinking that, by equivocating over the referendum, he could somehow please those supposedly natural Labour voters in the Midlands and the north who had voted Leave in the referendum. The election showed that too many of them merely laughed in his face. It seems that the election was also a referendum on Corbyn. There has been, and will continue to be, endless speculation about the reasons why the electorate distrusted him even more than Johnson. But historically there seems to me a simple, fundamental cause, whatever the deficiencies in Corbyn personally. In the early 1980s the sensible centre of the Labour party fought the extreme left – then known as the Militant Tendency, not Momentum – and saw them off. The late Denis Healey played a crucial role, as did Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley. And the moderate left in Britain and continental Europe watched the failure of President Mitterrand’s experiment with “socialism in one country” between 1981 and 1983 and learned the lesson. Among those who learned the lesson was Mitterrand himself. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also took note. Alas, this time the extreme left captured the Labour party, with the results we now see. For reasons that I fail to understand, Corbyn and his allies, such as Seumas Milne, believe that the EU is some kind of capitalist conspiracy. Despite the many doubts about Corbyn himself, if he had not equivocated and campaigned vigorously in favour of Remain and a referendum with no ifs or buts, there might well have been a hung parliament and deals which could have contained Corbyn’s wilder plans. Also, the hapless Jo Swinson should not have made the strategic mistake of ruling out the second referendum her party had previously espoused. However, we are where we are. The Brexit and Conservative party is going to “deliver” Brexit. But so far from “getting Brexit done”, the election result means that Brexit has only just begun. Is the British public bored by Brexit talk? I am sorry, but there is a lot more boredom in store, and goodness knows how much economic damage from leaving the single market – the creation of which was, ironically, considered by Kenneth Clarke as Margaret Thatcher’s greatest achievement. Happy Christmas!"
"As we wrap up the year, I thought it would be fun to look back at all the columns I have written for the Guardian and pull out the five stories that were my favorites. Why are these my favorites? Mostly because these stories captured the best and worst aspects of running a small business this year. Female-owned businesses: the US economy’s quiet success story A report earlier this year found that 42% of all firms are female-owned and women started 1,817 businesses a day in the past year. My daughter is currently watching Mad Men for the first time and was shocked at how women were treated in the workplace a mere 50 years ago. To me, that just shows how much things have changed. Unfortunately – as I also wrote here – the out-of-date attitudes of some men in positions of power continue to challenge female advancement and opportunities in the workplace. But, there’s still been a lot of progress. As I wrote: “The fact is that women have made significant gains not only in the workplace but in entrepreneurship. Of course there is still a long way to go to achieve equality. But, compared with the data from 10 or 20 years before, there’s no dispute that the environment continues to improve.” Unlimited vacation isn’t as crazy as it sounds – and it can save you money I like reporting on small business news, but I also enjoy sharing good tactics that can help small business owners grow. One of these tactics involves unlimited vacation. 2019 was a year of very tight unemployment and just about every small business owner I know struggled to find and keep good employees. So what about unlimited vacation? Don’t laugh. My report found that unlimited vacation plans can be a potential great benefit and not as costly or as risky as they may seem. As I wrote: “... the vacation benefits you offer should best suit the interests of your employees and your company’s culture. An unlimited paid time-off plan may not be the right thing for your business. But considering some of the potential financial benefits, you should at least be seriously considering it.” Could this be the worst cafe in the world? I know I’m supposed to cover American businesses, but this little restaurant in an out-of-the-way place in New Zealand was too irresistible to ignore. “Just how bad is the customer service at the Springfield Store and Cafe?” I wrote. “So bad that people have been reportedly chased out of the cafe and others were forced to leave in tears after being abused by staff members. So bad that the police have actually been called and so bad that some of the local residents boycott the restaurant. ‘It’s an embarrassment to our community,’ one resident said. ‘You don’t have to talk to too many people before you come across somebody who’s had a bad experience there. I want them gone – the whole town wants them gone.’” But what’s interesting is that the cafe continues to thrive. Why? It has decent food and its owner’s behavior draws curiosity. Sometimes even poorly run businesses can succeed, despite their best efforts to fail. Why ‘Slutty Vegan’ became a hit in Atlanta – a city known for its barbecue Speaking of peculiar businesses, this one caught my attention last January because what kind of crazy person sells vegan food in the epicenter of barbecue, Atlanta, Georgia? And kills it! It’s a smart entrepreneur named Pinky Cole, a food truck owner who opened her first brick-and-mortar vegan eatery called Slutty Vegan at the beginning of the year and saw more than 1,200 people line up outside its doors on its very first day. Combining great food with an even better name, Cole’s restaurant has been a hit in 2019, attracting celebrities such as Shaquille O’Neal. She’s also laying the plans for more locations in 2020. No, she will never get me to stop eating meat – but I have to admit it will be tough to resist a Fussy Hussy (it consists of a plant-based patty with vegan cheese, shredded lettuce, onion, pickle and vegan mayo on a Hawaiian bun) the next time I’m in town. What’s the dynamic demographic running America’s small businesses? Older people OK Boomer, you’re still in charge. I’m thrilled for all the female entrepreneurs who are finally making their mark, but can we still give a small shoutout to us old people? The fact is that America’s small businesses are still dominated by people in their 50s and 60s, and if you’re marketing to small businesses, you best not ignore this demographic. According to a survey, 57% of small business owners were born between 1946 and 1964. Sure, millennials are taking over the workplace and will very soon (thank goodness) take over the world. But that’s not going to happen right away and in the meantime it’s the boomers who are still running the majority of our country’s small businesses. I wish I had the time to include more, but there’s eggnog to consume. So for now, have a great new year and see you in 2020 with more stories about and for small business owners. It’s going to be a busy and interesting year for us all."
"In a parallel political universe, Ofwat’s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was announced on Monday. Incoming Labour ministers would instead be inspecting their soon-to-be nationalised assets. None of that will now happen, so the key issue in a still-privatised world is different. Will any of the companies that have bleated behind the scenes about a “politicised” regulatory process dare to allege unreasonable harshness on the part of Ofwat? Will any appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)? We’ll have to wait eight weeks – the permitted period for an appeal – to find out, but the likely suspects would be well advised to swallow their medicine. First, Ofwat’s review is pitched as the “toughest ever”, but so it had to be. Shareholders since privatisation in 1989 have enjoyed a dividend bonanza so this was always going to be a moment to lean in the opposite direction. That’s not evidence of politicisation; it’s just a recognition that regulation has been too lax. Ofwat’s new demands will strike most bill-payers as reasonable: lower returns on capital; a reduction in bills by £50 on average, ignoring inflation, over the next five years; and a 16% cut in leaks. Second, Ofwat has given some ground between its “draft” and “final” calculations. Companies, in aggregate, will be allowed about £1.5bn of extra expenditure to meet performance targets. The concession is not huge in the context of a £51bn spending programme, but it’s a softening. Third, the new regime will only look “tough” to the laggards, judged by efficiency. Note how the share price of Severn Trent, one of three companies that got top-of-the-class “fast track” status during Ofwat’s review, is within pennies of its all-time high. Its shareholders see little to frighten them. Fourth, an appeal to the CMA is not a one-way bet. The competition regulator is allowed to conclude that Ofwat should have been harder. That thought ought to concentrate minds in the boardrooms of the four companies – Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames and Yorkshire – that are thought most likely to appeal. It’s time for them to accept that, in a privatised but regulated system, owners have to take a hit sometimes. On – then off – the buses It’s hard to keep up with transport firm FirstGroup’s view of its best strategy. Back in May, the “future emphasis” for the group was going to be First Student and First Transit, its two North American bus contractors, since they had “the greatest potential to generate sustainable value and growth over time”. Now both operations may be sold. What’s prompted the U-turn? One can point to the arrival of David Martin as chairman in August but, since he seemed to endorse the May vision only last month, the latest development looks to be a lobbying triumph for activist investor Coast Capital, aided these days by fellow investor Robert Tchenguiz. The duo demanded a sale of all US assets, not just the Greyhound coaching business, a few weeks ago; now they may get it. A UK-only future would be a mighty come-down for FirstGroup, which can currently call itself one of the world’s largest transport companies with 100,000 employees. Indeed, even within the UK, the future of the bus division is unclear, as FirstGroup is exploring what form of “separation” is possible while meeting pension obligations. If the buses were also to exit along with the US assets, all that would be left would be the UK rail business, from which FirstGroup seemed to be contemplating an orderly retreat only a year ago. Then it won the West Coast Partnership franchise and all is now apparently right with rail. One can view this strategic soul-searching as an exercise in “rationalisation”, the polite term for a break-up. It’s hard, though, to escape the feeling that there’s a simpler alternative to uncertain deal-making: just run the businesses better. Going up … ? Mike Ashley has been banging on about his “elevation” strategy for years and now he has something to show for it: a share price that elevated by 31% in a day. Context is everything, however. The improvement to 472p merely took the shares back to where they stood at the start of 2016, which is roughly when Ashley adopted his other obsession – diversification. House of Fraser, the main product of that ambition, clearly isn’t getting worse, which was why the shares jumped on Monday. But the eventual returns from the HoF deal remain a mystery. Ashley runs a tighter ship than the old management (no surprise there) but the long-term investment demands in the department store business are anyone’s guess."
"With its army of perfectly groomed and manicured shop assistants, the department store beauty hall has traditionally been the backbone of a £2.5bn trade in expensive lipsticks, face creams or perfumes. But cosmetics sales have plummeted this year as high street shutdowns, coupled with the shift to home-working, has prompted many people to ditch their makeup bags. Sales of the designer brands sold via glossy counters in department stores are down by more than 40% this year, a decrease worth almost £500m, according to the market researcher NPD. The decline is even bigger if you throw in the £180m hit to sales of cheaper lipsticks and eyeshadows bought alongside groceries in supermarkets. Women are simply wearing less makeup, said Alexia Inge, the co-founder of the Cult Beauty website. “The lockdown expedited trends that were already happening. People were already starting to take a different approach to makeup from the Insta-glam layer-upon-layer [look].” The so-called “lipstick index” is often used as a barometer of consumer confidence during periods of economic turmoil. The term, which was coined by the former Estée Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder in the early 2000s, refers to the usual resiliency of cosmetics with makeup seen as an affordable indulgence when bigger purchases are out of reach. But the index never saw Covid-19 coming, with its mandatory face-coverings that mean no one can even see your lips, let alone what colour they are. During the lockdown, demand for products many would once have considered an essential part of their daily beauty routine – such as foundation and lipstick – was down by more than 70%. “Everyone likes to roll out Lauder’s lipstick effect … but lipstick sales are probably the worst of any category right now,” said Inge. Instead, she added, we should look at skincare, which is the “makeup equivalent” of the leisurewear people have been wearing at home during the pandemic. While Cult Beauty’s lipstick sales were down 8%, its skincare sales have more than doubled. This dramatic shift in spending priorities is borne out in figures from the department store chain John Lewis. Its sales of skincare, body and hair products are up 234% this year, as people opt to spend time caring for their skin rather than applying makeup. John Lewis predicts some of the changes seen this year will stay around and that cosmetics bags will get smaller as women abandon lip pencils and contouring sticks – a hard-to-do blending technique popularised by Kim Kardashian – and switch to easy to use multipurpose products, such as tinted moisturiser and lip balm. Long periods at home have driven shoppers into the arms of Cult Beauty and its discount-driven Lookfantastic, which is part of The Hut Group founded by the billionaire Matthew Moulding. In common with other retail markets such as furniture, more than 40% of beauty sales will be online this year – almost double 2019’s level. The failure of a major player like Debenhams, with its 124 stores and 12,000 staff, is a fresh blow for the beauty industry left reeling by this year’s lengthy salon closures. Yes, times are tough for the high street, said June Jensen-Mills, the head of UK beauty at market researchers NPD, but store sales are likely to bounce back in 2021. “I believe that bricks and mortar will go back to being important,” she said. “People will want to meet up with friends, try things, have a coffee. Debenhams is an important player in the world of beauty but when a retailer closes customers shift to similar retailers where they feel at home.” There are also new powerful forces at work in the industry as the glitzy websites of blockbuster brands such as Charlotte Tilbury compete with the department stores that are also their business partners. For shoppers the joy of the beauty hall lies in the ability to discover new brands, trial out textures, test colours and sample scents, but coronavirus restrictions mean that is, in many cases, no longer possible. But department stores brands are fighting back with innovative new ways of selling, such as virtual masterclasses and compiling “discovery boxes” of sample-sized products. People seem to like it. Last week John Lewis and Charlotte Tilbury broke the Guinness World Records’ title for the UK’s largest ever beauty masterclass after 10,000 people signed up to “brush along at home” to create a “timeless 90s supermodel-inspired look”. Consumers may be looking for “simplicity” now but their feelings may change in 2021. “I have a strong feeling that once we come out of lockdown, and the bars and discos are open again, things will pick up,” said Jensen-Mills. “People will think ‘I’ve had an awful year and I want to make myself feel and look great’. Let’s just slap on loads of foundation and lipstick.”"
"Toyota will stop production at its British and French plants earlier than scheduled before Christmas because of the chaos caused by Covid-19 border closures. The Japanese carmaker said it was expecting shortages of parts as a result of transport delays, after France’s 48-hour ban on accompanied freight or cargo from Britain led to queues of lorries miles long stuck near Dover. Toyota said it had decided to bring forward the “planned seasonal stop” at its engine plant in Deeside in north Wales and its factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire, where it makes the Corolla. About 3,000 people are employed at the two plants. The Deeside site will close for Christmas on Tuesday and the Burnaston plant on Wednesday. Its French site will also stop production two days earlier than planned. The European factories would ordinarily have closed for an annual shutdown on Christmas Eve and remained shut until 4 January. Toyota said it wanted to “help ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”. The car manufacturer said it had taken the decision “in light of the traffic bans that a growing number of countries have issued for travel from the UK and due to the uncertain nature of how long the borders will be closed for logistics activities”. The extended shutdown caps a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, which halted production in the spring as the first wave of the pandemic took hold. The French government is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday about reopening transport links with the UK. Paris failed to lift its 48-hour ban on freight and passengers from Britain over fears about the new coronavirus strain, despite a phone call on Monday evening between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. France is one of more than 40 countries that have suspended flights and trains from the UK, including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey and Canada. However, the suspension of cross-Channel transport has caused the most disruption in and around British ports, which were already struggling with increased workloads because of the arrival of Christmas goods, companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit and coronavirus restrictions."
"Shaftesbury, one of the biggest landlords in central London, has slumped to a £700m loss after slashing the value of its portfolio, as the West End braces for tougher Covid-19 restrictions. The company, which owns parts of Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden, has been hit by the sharp fall in the number of tourists and office workers coming into the capital. It said vacancies at its shops, restaurants and offices had nearly tripled to 10.2% in the year to 30 September. As tenants struggled to pay their rent, Shaftesbury’s net income fell by 24% to £74.3 . It collected only 53% of the rent due in the second half of the year. This resulted in an annual loss after tax of £699.5m, compared with a profit of £26m the previous year. Shaftesbury wrote down the value of its portfolio by 18.3% to £3.1bn, as the amount of empty space in the West End increased, rental income fell and physical distancing measures reduced demand from retail and office tenants for more space. Brian Bickell, the Shaftesbury chief executive, said: “Rarely in history has the world seen such widespread disruption to normal patterns of life. Only now are we seeing the first positive signs that conditions will begin to improve in the year ahead.” Shaftesbury said its leasing activity had declined sharply since February due to the pandemic and was below normal levels, although there had been a pickup in inquiries in recent weeks. The pandemic has also forced landlords to rewrite lease agreements to help tenants get through the crisis, and Shaftesbury moved permanently to monthly rents for most commercial tenants from October. The company said its rental and service charge support for tenants was likely to continue through 2021, “with our occupiers having reduced income in the important period leading up to Christmas and into the new year, which traditionally has provided them with liquidity buffers to withstand the normally slower quarter to March”. London is among the areas that enter tier 3 restrictions on Wednesday, which means hotels, pubs, bars and restaurants have to close again and can only do takeaways and deliver. Shaftesbury gave a gloomy outlook for next year, predicting that pandemic control measures were “likely for much of 2021”. Even so, the firm was confident in the West End’s long-term ability to attract visitors. Bickell said: “In the year ahead, the widespread distribution of effective vaccines will bring a gradual return of confidence and activity across the West End and, a recovery in domestic footfall and spending to our villages. “At the present time, it is not possible to predict at what point conditions will improve but it is likely social distancing and other restrictions, with the risk of further lockdowns, will continue into the spring and possibly early summer, putting further financial strain on many of our occupiers.”"
"Britain’s economy is suffering increasing damage from the rapid growth in Covid infections, renewed lockdown measures, and turmoil over Brexit at the end of the worst year for growth in three centuries, according to a Guardian analysis. With negotiations going down to the wire amid vast tailbacks at Dover before the Brexit transition expires on New Year’s Eve, the latest figures from the UK economy show stalling growth, falling retail sales, and redundancies rising at the fastest rate since records began. In a month that started with a burst of optimism as a British woman became the first patient in the world to receive the coronavirus vaccine, December is ending with the pandemic surging to a fresh peak and Boris Johnson’s government imposing tougher lockdown measures before Christmas. To counter the emergence of a faster-spreading Covid variant in the UK, and as Brexit talks intensify, the French ban on freight movements has led to chaos in Kent days before a no-deal Brexit could trigger renewed turmoil. Official figures had shown the British economy recovered from lockdown this spring at a faster rate than first anticipated, amid hopes that a vaccine could bring an early end to the crisis. However, economists now forecast a double-dip recession and tougher lockdowns lasting into 2021 before the vaccine can be rolled out widely enough. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Brexit – with or without a trade deal with Brussels – would hit an already weak UK economy at the start of next year. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “It does seem to me to be the worst decision in peacetime any country in the world has made in a thousand years. Lines of lorries at Dover and Folkestone do not augur well for what is to come, even before Boris Johnson cancelled Christmas.” Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries. In the past month, there have been some bright spots for the economy, including a recovery in business activity in early December after the second national lockdown in England. Tougher restrictions in the autumn appear to have had less of an impact on growth and jobs than during the first wave of the pandemic. Official figures show Britain’s economy staged a faster recovery in the third quarter of the year than was first estimated, after a rapid return to work after the first lockdown. However, official growth figures also show the economy started sinking towards a double-dip recession even before Covid restrictions were reimposed in November. The Bank of England has warned the economy will shrink in the final months of 2020 and could remain weaker than expected at the start of 2021, as controls are kept in place to handle rising infections before the Covid vaccine can be rolled out widely. In response to the renewed period of economic pain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unexpectedly extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, a month longer than planned. Use of the flagship wage subsidy programme, which has cost the government almost £50bn so far, doubled in November to about 5 million workers, reflects the intense pressure facing companies. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of people being made redundant reached a record high in October, at a time when the government was winding down furlough before a last-minute U-turn to extend the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends. Blanchflower said: “The issue is whether these jobs – many in pubs, clubs and restaurants – return after the furlough payments stop. But many jobs won’t return, if there are long-run changes in behaviour after the pandemic as expected.”"
"The former owner of Norton Motorcycles will be forced to pay back about £14m missing from the company’s employee retirement fund, after being refused permission to appeal against a pensions ombudsman’s ruling. Stuart Garner, who acquired the classic marque in 2008 and was feted for years by a series of UK government ministers, was told by the regulator in June to refund three retirement funds he controlled as trustee, following an ombudsman ruling that he had acted dishonestly. The ombudsman’s decision followed an investigation triggered by claims brought by 30 members that Garner had repeatedly failed to return their funds when they were due. The Pension Schemes Act requires trustees to transfer pensions within six months of an application. The court’s refusal to entertain Garner’s request to appeal is another blow for the businessman, who appears to have been pushed a step closer to personal bankruptcy. He is already the subject of a personal bankruptcy petition filed by Leicester city council. The repayment of the £14m to the pension holders, the vast majority of whom were never Norton employees, had been on hold while the court considered Garner’s request for permission to appeal. In an August order delaying the payment, Mr Justice Fancourt said: “The sum likely to be payable … is extremely large and it is readily understandable that [Garner] will not be able to pay it and that, as a result, he is liable to be made bankrupt.” In his latest judgment refusing an appeal, however, Fancourt stated: “There could have been no good reason to delay the payment of compensation unless there was compelling evidence that it would be provided by other means within the timescale specified by the ombudsman.” Garner has been granted permission to appeal against a further £180,000 in distress payments to 30 of the scheme’s 228 members, to whom he had repeatedly failed to return funds when they were due. The businessman’s law firm said: “Mr Garner has been granted permission to appeal the inconvenience award, and has renewed his application for permission to appeal in respect of the refusal.” Garner, who was the trustee of three Norton pension funds, invested all of the members’ savings into his own company, but Norton slumped into administration on 29 January. The ombudsman’s determination in the summer stated: “The trustee has acted dishonestly and in breach of his duty of no conflict, his duty not to profit and his duty to act with prudence.” The decision followed a Guardian and ITV News investigation in January that showed how 228 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares after they had been duped by a fraudster. Garner received the retirement savings during 2012 and 2013, after a scam that resulted in a promoter, Simon Colfer, being convicted of fraud in 2018 for the way he had sold the scheme. Two further Garner associates involved in setting up the Norton pensions schemes, Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley, were convicted of a separate tax fraud in 2013, when they reclaimed £5m of tax rebates from fictitious pension contributions. Court documents from that trial show that £990,000 of the fraud proceeds were loaned to Garner to acquire Norton in 2008. Garner denies wrongdoing and has said he considers himself a victim because he did not know he was dealing with fraudsters."
"Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are much more likely than white people to work in hospitality, one of the sectors hardest hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic as restaurants, bars and other venues have been shut for months during the lockdowns. About one in 12 (8%) workers from BAME backgrounds are employed in hospitality roles. That compares with about one in 20 (5%) white British workers, research from the Resolution Foundation shows. Overall, 300,000 people from BAME backgrounds work in hospitality. The thinktank’s report found that even before the pandemic hit, hospitality was one of the lowest paying sectors in the economy, with a typical hourly pay of £8.72. It said that 23% of hospitality workers were paid at or below the national living wage. The research found that BAME workers in the sector also faced “pay penalties” – pay gaps that account for workers’ age, qualifications, experience, and the kinds of jobs they do – relative to white British workers. “Crucially, these pay penalties are bigger than the raw pay gaps found in official earnings data – suggesting that the extent of disadvantage is bigger than previously thought,” the report said. BAME men were paid 65p an hour less than white British men on average, the report found. BAME women were also underpaid compared with white British women but the gap was less severe. The report found that while hospitality as a whole disproportionately employed young people – over a third of its workforce were aged 16-24 – this was not always the case for BAME workers. For example, the typical age of a Bangladeshi worker in hospitality was 42 – higher than the typical age for Bangladeshi workers across the whole economy (35), and higher than white British workers in hospitality (28). Indian workers in hospitality were among the highest paid ethnic group per hour (£8.96) and among the most likely to be in high-paying occupations (28%) such as hotel and restaurant managers. This corresponds with 41% of Indian hospitality workers holding a degree. In comparison, one in four Bangladeshi hospitality workers had no qualifications and typically earned 12% less than Indian hospitality workers, at £7.85 an hour. Nye Cominetti, the senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “As workers from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately likely to work in hospitality, a significant number of workers risk moving into unemployment when the furlough scheme ends in the spring. “The government should bear that in mind for the jobs support programmes it is providing.” A report by the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association and the consultancy Oxford Economics has previously warned that 291,000 jobs in the hospitality trade could be lost as a result of coronavirus restrictions. The forecast was based on industry data suggesting that 25% of pubs could close, with the remainder barely breaking even as they struggle to cope with reduced custom and limited opening hours. Oxford Economics said the worst-case scenario would reduce the sector’s economic output by £7.4bn and cut wages by £3.9bn."
"Family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain &amp; Co has handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened their closure. Brains, whose pubs are mainly based in south and west Wales, said it had come “under significant financial pressure” during the pandemic, as restrictions mean pubs must remain closed except for takeaway and delivery. The company closed its entire pub estate on 4 December after the announcement of a ban on alcohol sales and enforced 6pm closing across Wales to try to contain a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Remaining open under those restrictions was “not a viable option”, Brains said. SA Brain &amp; Co was established in 1882 in Cardiff, and became Wales’s biggest brewer and pubs company while remaining under family ownership. John Rhys, the company chairman who oversaw the deal, is the great-grandson of founder Samuel Arthur Brain. Before the pandemic, the pubs included in the deal made £14m a year in core earnings. Marston’s will take over the pubs in February, mostly under 25-year leases from Brains. The annual rent on the pubs was £5.5m. The pubs will be run under the Brains brand, and will continue to sell its beer, which is brewed at a facility in Cardiff Bay that was opened in March 2019. Before that Brains was made in breweries in Cardiff’s city centre. Rhys said: “We know and trust Marston’s to be excellent custodians of our pubs and, while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we are confident that our pubs and our pubs teams will thrive under their stewardship. “Furthermore, this transaction enables Brains to recapitalise its balance sheet and continue its long heritage as an independent entity, preserving this great Welsh business for generations to come.” Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, runs about 1,400 pubs across the UK, including 106 in Wales. The 1,300 employees in Brains pubs will transfer to Marston’s, which employs a further 14,000 people across the UK. Ralph Findlay, the Marston’s chief executive, said the deal would be mutually beneficial and that it “strengthens our representation in south and west Wales, while protecting the heritage and independence of an iconic Welsh business”."
"Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite an overall drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home prompted consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres. Data from Barclaycard shows spending at independent food and drink shops, including off-licences, butchers and bakeries, jumped 28.6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, total consumer spending fell 7.1%, as social distancing rules left shoppers with fewer opportunities to spend on overseas holidays, hospitality and in city centres. Barclaycard, which covers nearly half of the UK’s credit and debit card transactions, found that while spending on essential goods such as groceries rose by 4.1% compared with 2019, non-essential spending fell 11.3%. Department stores were particularly hard hit, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. However, bricks and mortar discounters had a 25.4% increase, as Britons facing furlough and job cuts sought value for money deals. Consumers forced to spend more time at home turned to DIY projects to spruce up their living space. Pent-up demand after the reopening of non-essential shops in June pushed overall spending at DIY and home goods stores up 9.8% for the year. Furniture retailers reported a 5.3% rise, as consumers invested in big ticket items. Britons treated themselves – as well as friends and family they could not see – to flowers throughout the year, with spending at florists rising 22.7%. Crafts and hobby spending increased 9.8%, and pets were given extra attention with vet and pet retail increasing 10.7%. But the report also shows how much restaurants suffered despite Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” initiative over the summer. Restrictions throughout the rest of the year contributed to a 47% drop in restaurant spending, while bars and pubs took a 36.7% hit. However, Covid restrictions contributed to a 49.1% rise in spending on online takeaway orders, while meal subscription services jumped 62.4%. Demand for at-home entertainment pushed spending on digital subscriptions up 31.5%, while money spent on electronics including game consoles rose 10.8%. Meanwhile, general online retailers benefited from a 52.5% hike in spending. Raheel Ahmed, Barclaycard’s head of consumer products, said: “2020 has accelerated many trends. E-commerce has seen huge growth, working from home has meant many are shopping more locally, and experiences within the home, such as virtual workouts, have become the norm.” Travel spending, including on airlines and travel agents, tumbled 61.1% in August and 63.1% in September, as coronavirus restrictions and quarantine rules took their toll. “Hopefully with a vaccine being rolled out in 2021 we will see green shoots for the most severely impacted sectors,” Ahmed said. “Having said that, some of the trends and changes we have seen in customer habits may be here to stay.”"
"The plus-size clothing brand Evans has been bought out of administration in a £23m deal that will result in the closure of all its stores and concessions with the potential loss of hundreds of jobs . The chain is the first part of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group to be sold off, marking the beginning of the breakup of his fashion empire, which also includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, plans to operate Evans, which made sales of £26m online and via wholesale last year, as an online-only brand. That will mean the closure of more than 100 Evans concessions and outlets within other Arcadia stores. Five standalone stores will permanently close with the loss of 25 jobs. The concessions and other outlets will not close immediately but hundreds of jobs are at risk at those outlets. Arcadia, which employs 13,000 people at about 500 outlets, collapsed into administration last month as high street lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic piled on pressure after years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. Bids for all the brands are due to be filed on Monday, with Topshop expected to attract offers of up to £200m. Bidders are thought to include the online specialist Boohoo, the fashion and homewares group Next, and Authentic Brands, the owner of the US department store Barneys. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, is also thought to be interested in the smaller Arcadia brands. Administrators from Deloitte said on Monday there had been “significant expressions of interest for all brands”. They said they did not expect to provide a further update on the process until January. City Chic Collective said it had bought Evans as part of a plan to extend its portfolio of plus-size brands, which include City Chic and Hips &amp; Curves, into Europe. It operates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it bought the Avenue brand last year. The company already had a relationship with Evans, which has sold City Chic products via its website for the past five years. “Our vision has always been to lead a world of curves,” said Phil Ryan, the chief executive of City Chic Collective. “From modern fashion to casual apparel, intimates and footwear, designing fashion for the curvy woman that fits and flatters, is all we do.”"
"Retail sales fell by 3.8% in November on the previous month as the coronavirus lockdown in England and restrictions elsewhere in the UK shut much of the high street. Ending a six-month run of rising sales, the figures revealed the impact of the pandemic on the sector as the infection rate increased across the country. A 19% fall in clothing sales followed the closure of most department stores and non-essential shops. A government message that workers should stay at home if they could caused car journeys to slump and petrol sales to follow suit, with a 16.6% decline. The only bright spot for retailers was an increase in the sale of household goods of 1.6% as shoppers went online to stock up for Christmas. Supermarkets and food stores increased sales by 3.1%. Analysts said it was no surprise the lockdown bolstered online shopping to a record total of 31.4% of all spending, after an increase of almost 75% since November 2019. The Office for National Statistics said 90% of businesses continued to trade in some form through the month, mostly via a click-and-collect service. But only 68.8% of department stores continued trading. Meanwhile, many online retailers reported a boom in sales, as they did during the UK-wide lockdown in spring, though heavy discounting helped to keep the tills ringing. The ONS said this week price-cutting by clothing retailers last month pushed UK inflation down to 0.3%, from 0.7% a month earlier. The Bank of England’s inflation target is 2%. Aled Patchett, the head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: “November’s sales highlight once again the polarising effect of Covid-19 on retail. Sectors like grocery and homeware perform well – and should be expected to have a strong finish to the year – while others including big-name high street brands fall foul of significantly reduced footfall. “Despite most shoppers having wrapped up their Covid Christmas shopping online this year, shops – particularly in smaller towns – will be hoping that the vaccine rollout inspires greater consumer confidence in the new year as people return to city centres for both work and play.” In October, a 6.4% increase in online sales spurred a 1.2% rise in the total volume of retail spending, mainly driven by shoppers rushing to buy early Christmas presents before the second lockdown in England. Lee Lucas, the chief executive of the Fashion Retail Academy, which has partnerships with some of Britain’s biggest retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Next, said he was not surprised the November lockdown triggered a fall in clothing sales. “November is one the busiest months of the year for retailers, so this emergency measure by the government will have been directly responsible for the unusually high level of discounting currently in stores, with shops fighting for every consumer in the briefest of run-ups to Christmas.”"
"The UK public’s appetite for eating out has plunged to its weakest since the spring amid growing evidence of the impact of the Omicron variant on the hospitality sector during its crucial pre-Christmas period. The number of seated diners fell by 14 percentage points in the week ending 20 December to 88% of the level in the same period of 2019, before the start of the pandemic, according to the weekly digest of flash economic indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Using data from the online restaurant booking site OpenTable and other sources, the ONS said Britons were eating out less and working from home more in response to rising infection rates and the government’s plan B measures. Amid widespread reports of bookings being cancelled, the drop in the number of diners in the latest week was the sharpest since early September and the lowest level since restaurants reopened indoors in England, Scotland and Wales in May after last winter’s lockdown. It was also the first time the weekly comparison with 2019 has dropped below 100% since May. Restaurants in London have been especially hard hit by Omicron, with the number of diners in the latest week falling 18 points to 57% of the level in the same period of 2019. In Manchester, despite an eight-point drop on the week, the number of diners stood at 104% of the level in the run-up to Christmas 2019. The ONS said the number of firms reporting staff working from home in the latest two weeks had risen by two points to 14%, with a marked impact on businesses reliant on consumers. Transactions at Pret a Manger sandwich outlets were lower in the week ending 16 December than in January 2020 in six of seven urban locations, with London again the most affected city. While trade in regional towns remained above pre-pandemic levels, sales in the capital dropped by 29 points to barely 50% of the January 2020 level. The ONS report showed retailers doing less badly than restaurants, with footfall in the latest week 81% of its 2019 level – a drop of only one percentage point. Credit and debt card payment purchases were up 4% on a year ago. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced an emergency £1bn package to help businesses struggling with the impact of Omicron. Meanwhile, analysts are warning that the economy is likely to contract in December even if restrictions in England remain unchanged. Andrew Goodwin, a UK economist at the consultancy firm Oxford Economics, said: “Though the government has opted to defer a decision on introducing further restrictions until after Christmas, it seems likely that a mix of greater consumer caution and reduced mobility will ensure that the UK’s GDP falls in December.”"
"Ikea has increased the price of its flat-pack furniture by up to 50%, blaming supply chain costs caused by Covid-19, in a move that will further stoke growing concern about the rising cost of living. After customers complained that prices appeared to have risen sharply after Christmas, the retailer said it was no longer able to absorb increased costs and was passing them on to consumers. An Ikea spokesperson tweeted: “Unfortunately, there has been a significant increase in costs across the supply chain, including in raw materials, transport and logistics. As this is still ongoing, it is necessary to increase prices across many of our products.” Archived versions of Ikea’s website from as recently as October showed significant price increases, including a Malm desk that has gone up from £99 to £150, a jump of more than 50%. A Jokkmokk table with four chairs is also up 50%, from £99 to £149, compared with earlier this year. A Hemnes daybed has gone up from £215 to £279, a 30% rise, while an Alex nine-drawer unit increased 35% from £85 to £115, according to archived versions of the Ikea website from earlier this year. A Kura children’s bed was up by 14% from £129 to £150, while Ikea’s Klippan sofa, one of the Swedish store’s most popular items, is £20 more expensive – a rise of 11% – at £199. Ikea confirmed that the company had raised prices across multiple countries and ranges. A spokesperson said: “Since the start of the pandemic, Ikea has managed to absorb the significant cost increases experienced across the supply chain while keeping prices as low and stable as we possibly can. Now, like many other retailers, we have had to raise our prices to mitigate the impact on our business. “Price increases vary but remain in line with what we are seeing globally at Ikea, which is approximately a 9% average increase across countries and the product range. Affordability remains at the heart of our business, and our focus will always be on continuing to offer quality, sustainable home furnishings at an affordable price for the many people.” Ikea warned earlier this year that prices would rise, citing factors including bottlenecks in shipping raw materials from Asia to Europe. The wider furniture industry has suffered significant delays, with the online furniture retailer Made.com saying that up to £45m-worth of orders have been delayed. It blamed a profit warning on factory shutdowns in Vietnam, clogged ports and extended shipping times. Rising prices at Ikea come amid broader concern about the cost of living, after UK inflation hit a 10-year high of 5.1% in November. Soaring energy bills and rising taxes prompted 2022 to be dubbed the “year of the squeeze” by a thinktank report published this week."
"The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices. The energy industry believes the crisis, during which more than 26 energy suppliers have gone bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. Other interventions the industry would like to see considered include extending fuel grants and moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation. Trade body Energy UK said on Thursday that consumers could expect their bills to soar by as much as 50% from 1 April. While wholesale prices continue to climb steeply, the UK’s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers. The price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been at a record £1,277 Since 1 October. Ofgem is expected to raise the cap significantly on 1 April. EDF has said the cap could hit £2,000 by next October, when the cap is reviewed again. Analysts at Investec believe the expected bill increase in April would add 1.8 percentage points to inflation next year. On Thursday, the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the expected £600 rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up. One plan being formulated by the energy industry to would involve a government-administered loan scheme to spread the impact of the price increases over several years. The plan would involve one or more commercial lenders – such as banks – covering the immediate cost of buying energy on wholesale markets at record prices, with a sum of at least £7bn. The loans would not require a government guarantee, but officials would be responsible for ensuring repayments. “We regularly engage with the energy industry and will continue to ensure that consumers are protected through the energy price cap, which is insulating millions from record global gas prices,” a government spokesperson said. “We also continue to support those most in need through our £500mhousehold support fund, the warm home discount and winter fuel payments.”"
"On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gave a mid-year economic update predicting a solid economic bounceback from Covid restrictions. We’ve looked under the hood to see what the treasury’s crystal ball says is in store for the economy, what might go wrong, and how government finances will fare if they’re right. Forecasts The budget papers project the Australian economy will grow in real terms by 3.75% in 2021-22 and 3.5% in 2022-23, before easing back to 2.25% and 2.5% in the final two years of the forward projections. The unemployment rate is tipped to fall to 4.25% in that time. The treasury thinks Australians will be ambitious with their pay demands and bosses generous in a bid to keep workers, because wages growth is supposed to take off from 2.25% in 2021-22 to 3.25% in 2024-25. Inflation is projected to reach and stay at the mid-point of the reserve bank’s target range (2.5%) in 2022-23. Assumptions The treasury has assumed that with more than 80% of Australians aged 16 and above now vaccinated, rates will climb to more than 90%. So far so good. But the rest of the assumptions are … a little rosy. The treasury assumed lockdowns will no longer be required, with “most domestic activity restrictions” lifted by the start of 2022 and only basic density restrictions in place. There may be “temporary strengthening of activity restrictions” to contain localised outbreaks – but these short, sharp lockdown-like restrictions are assumed to have no material impact on the outlook. Remaining state border restrictions are assumed to be lifted by early 2022 and the Omicron variant “is not assumed to significantly alter current reopening plans or require a reimposition of widespread health and activity restrictions”. Migrants will start returning from 2022, with international students ready to go for the first semester of next year. What could go wrong In a word: Covid. If a new variant of concern emerges (beyond Omicron) requiring more significant health responses, the international border could be closed for another six months and public health orders and precautionary behaviour could drive down spending. The treasury projects this could mean 1% is shaved off gross domestic product in 2021-22, and unemployment is about 1% higher. The rebound would instead come in the second half of 2022. The papers also note that revenue assumptions and nominal GDP are also sensitive to changes in the iron ore price, with a US$10 fall shaving $3.9bn off GDP this year and $0.9bn off tax receipts next financial year. If the government has to pay higher interest rates on bonds, then debt could blow out by a further 5.4% of GDP by 2032. $16bn of mystery spending The budget papers reveal that there is about $16bn of mystery spending over the next four years, consisting of decisions taken but not announced, or measures for which the cost is not-for-publication. That’s more than 10 times the size of mystery spending last year. The papers make it impossible to calculate the size of the war chest for announcements to be made before the election, by mixing in a bunch of commercially sensitive spending items like vaccine purchases. But a treasury official in the lockup suggested it was about half and half … so, an $8bn war chest for the election. There will also be $940m more revenue collected due to decisions taken but not announced or not for publication measures. Debt and deficit For a government previously concerned with the debt and deficit disaster, there is still red as far as the eye can see. The deficit is tipped to be $99.2bn in 2021-22, an improvement of $7.4bn since the budget despite the Delta lockdowns. The deficit will still be $57.5bn in 2024-25 (or 2.3% of GDP), and only shrinks to 1.8% of GDP in 2031-32. Net debt is projected to be 30.6% of GDP at June 2022, rising to a peak of 37.4% in 2025, then down to 35.5% in 2032. The papers say that despite the economic recovery the government is sticking with the first plank of its budget plan – strong and sustained recovery – so don’t expect austerity measures to try to cut the debt and deficit."
"Britons are many times more likely to have experienced shortages of food and fuel than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll. Global supply chain problems prompted by the pandemic have disrupted the international trade network since the summer, with transport backlogs combining with labour shortages to create scarcities of various goods around the world. The government has argued that the shortages are part of a worldwide pattern and no worse in the UK than elsewhere, although logistics experts and other professionals – particularly in the food sector - have said the problems are amplified in Britain by a shortage of east European workers, including drivers, since Brexit. The YouGov poll showed residents of the UK were multiple times more likely to have experienced, or to know people who have experienced, shortages of food and fuel than people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, and somewhat more likely to have experienced them than those in the US. Asked in early December whether they had personally experienced any scarcity of foodstuffs in recent weeks, 56% of respondents in the UK said yes, while 9% said they had not personally experienced any but knew people who had. The corresponding figures in the US were 49% and 10%, but in continental Europe, the proportion of people who said they had been personally affected was between three and nine times lower: 18% in Germany, 16% in France, 12% in Sweden, 8% in Denmark, 7% and 6% in Italy. The proportion saying they knew people who had experienced food shortages ranged from 13% in France to 8% in Denmark and Italy – where 58% of respondents said they were not even aware that supply chain problems had led to food shortages. The UK was also the only country where substantial numbers of people said they had experienced fuel shortages in recent weeks, since the crisis in September and October. One in three Britons (33%) said they had personally experienced a recent scarcity of fuel, compared with no more than 10% in any other country. Only 8% of German respondents, 7% of those in France and 5% of those in Italy said they had been personally experienced fuel scarcity, with 37%, 38% and 53% respectively saying they had not even heard of the issue – compared with just 11% of respondents in Britain."
"Just Eat has entered the fast grocery delivery market by partnering with Asda in its first tie-up with a supermarket in the UK. From January, Just Eat customers will be able to add a range of products to their baskets starting with five Asda stores, with the exact locations to be announced in the new year. “We live in an on-demand world,” said Andrew Kenny, the UK managing director of Just Eat. “We want to make sure we are getting our customers the food they want, when they want, when they want it. Our tie-up with Asda means we can help people access everything from store cupboard essentials to fresh groceries in a matter of minutes.” Just Eat follows rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats, which already have fast delivery deals with some of the UK’s biggest supermarkets. Best-known for restaurant and fast food delivery, Just Eat said that up to 1,000 grocery items would be made available for customers to order seven days a week. The two companies anticipate the partnership to be extended to more Asda stores throughout next year. The partnership builds on an existing relationship, with Just Eat delivering pizzas and meal deals from Asda Kitchen, the grocer’s indoor cafe and diner, which operates at 42 locations nationwide. “We’re always looking for new ways to offer customers more choice and extend the number of delivery options available,” said Simon Gregg, the vice-president of online grocery at Asda. “The trial will also see Asda become more accessible to a wider customer base through Just Eat’s significant presence in the on-demand food delivery space.” Just Eat has more than 60,000 restaurant partners it offers a delivery service for, covering 95% of the UK. The food delivery service has more than 10,000 grocery and convenience store partners on its platform internationally, including brands such as Spar, Shell and 7-Eleven. Last month, Asda appointed Stuart Rose, the Conservative peer and former boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, as chairman."
"European markets have taken something of a fright before Christmas on Monday thanks to concerns about new restrictions to tackle the omicron variant - and Wall Street has followed their lead. Here are the opening snaps from the three main US benchmark stock indices: S&amp;P 500 DOWN 59.17 POINTS, OR 1.28%, AT 4,561.47 NASDAQ DOWN 227.60 POINTS, OR 1.50%, AT 14,942.08 DOW JONES DOWN 455.76 POINTS, OR 1.29%, AT 34,909.68 The mood has improved somewhat over the course of the day, however. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.9% to just over 7,200 points - but that is an improvement over the first few hours of trading. The pound has recovered against the US dollar - it is almost flat for the day at about $1.3235. Here are some of the other notable business events from today: Rolls-Royce won the backing of Qatar for small modular nuclear reactors. A $10bn spreadsheet error was among the reasons for a £47m Standard Chartered fine. Ex-Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis was appointed to lead GSK’s consumer products spinout, which is expected to become one of the FTSE 100’s biggest companies. UK pubs and restaurants have warned of plummeting sales and “decimated” bookings. Data showed UK high streets have also suffered markedly, with falling sales in what should have been their most profitable weekend. The annual shindig for corporate types at Davos has been postponed for the second year in a row. Cruise ship company Carnival has said it will be back to 2019 earnings before various costs by 2023 - but that the first half of 2022 could result in another loss. You can continue to follow the Guardian’s coverage from around the world on our homepage and via our live blogs: In the UK, Boris Johnson and ministers are meeting to consider further coronavirus restrictions for England In our global coronavirus coverage, Thailand is considering ending quarantine-free travel, and the EU is set to back the Novavax vaccine The bounce on European stock markets has run out, it seems. The FTSE 100 is wavering around a 1.1% decline for the day - perhaps it is waiting for direction from the UK cabinet, which is about to meet. However, any leaks (or indeed official messages) are likely to come very near the end of the trading day, if not after. The Dax in Germany is down by 1.8% and France’s Cac 40 has lost 1.1%. The Stoxx 600, which combines all of the above and more, is down by 1.5%. Britain’s largest pub chain JD Wetherspoon has appointed two employees to its board in response to criticisms of its corporate governance. Four out of about 100 managers of Spoons pubs were chosen after shareholders and employees said it would “benefit from having more pub experience at board level”, the company said on Monday. Debbie Whittingham, a regional manager for the West Midlands, and Hudson Simmons, area manager for Sheffield, will join the board, while another two will be “associate employee directors”. Tim Martin, Wetherspoon’s founder and chairman, has previously lashed out at those who have criticised the company’s corporate governance in lengthy letters published on the stock market’s news service. However, he said: Pub and area managers, and other members of pub teams, have always participated in weekly decision-making meetings, which distil suggestions from the ‘front line’. The appointment of employee directors will extend this approach to board meetings and will help to preserve the culture of the company for the future. It was cautiously welcomed by the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance. Luke Hildyard, the High Pay Centre’s executive director, said: The perspectives workers directors can offer in terms of improvements to customer service and employee relations are obvious. The new Wetherspoons directors would have more credibility and independence if they’d been elected by colleagues rather than appointed by existing board members and it should also be remembered that boardroom representation is a complement not a substitute for full trade union rights and recognition. But this is a positive step by Wetherspoons that will benefit both workers and shareholders in the long term. One to watch on the UK politics front: the prime minister has called a cabinet meeting at 2pm. As Andrew Sparrow points out on the Guardian’s UK politics live blog, there is not usually a cabinet meeting on a Monday, so this is an emergency coronavirus meeting. Dress codes and wine pairings have not yet been released. You can follow updates on the cabinet here: One for the central bank watchers: Germany’s new government has picked a new head of its central bank: “career central banker” Joachim Nagel. Nagel’s predecessor, Jens Weidmann, was perhaps the European Central Bank’s most prominent internal critic -arguing against the stimulus that it has used to prop up the EU economy. (All eurozone central bank heads get a place on the governing council, which sets monetary policy for the bloc.) Nagel, a former Bundesbank board member, will take over on 1 January. Reuters summarised his recent career as: A former board member of the state-owned development bank KfW Bank, Nagel currently works for the Bank for International Settlements, which is often considered the central bank of central banks. Early in his career, he was also a consultant for the SPD, the party that took over government earlier this month and will make the Bundesbank appointment one of its first decisions. Germany’s finance minister under the new coalition government, Christian Lindner, said on Monday: In view of inflation risks, the importance of a stability-oriented monetary policy is growing. He is an experienced personality who ensures continuity at the Bundesbank. The World Economic Forum at Davos has been postponed to the summer because of concerns about the coronavirus variant, it said on Monday. The event, usually held every year at the Swiss ski resort, was scheduled for 17 to 21 January 2022, but will instead happen in “early summer”. In January the World Economic Forum will instead run online meetings. Davos usually serves as an occasion for many of the world’s most powerful people from the realms of business, economics and politics to gather and pontificate about the world’s problems. However, the meeting of thousands of people from all over the world has been difficult to continue during pandemic conditions. The 2021 event was cancelled in favour of online events in the summer. In a statement, the event’s organisers said: Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting. Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary. The number of shoppers across British high streets fell over the weekend before Christmas, according to new data from Springboard that show people spurned city centre shopping during what should have been the biggest weekend of the year. Retail footfall was 19% down for the week ending on Saturday compared to the equivalent in 2019, Springboard said - although it was higher than December 2020, when the UK government dramatically u-turned to put in place a Christmas lockdown. Shopping centres fared particularly badly, with footfall down by 27% on 2019, but high streets were also down by a fifth on 2019. Retail parks, which are generally accessed by private car and are often open-air, performed slightly better. Weekend traffic overall fell compared to the previous weekend by 8.5% in Central London and by 6.4% in cities outside of the capital. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: The nervousness of shoppers about making in-person shopping visits inevitably meant that large city centres lost out to smaller high streets, particularly over the weekend when footfall declined from the week before in Central London and large cities outside of the capital whilst rising in market towns. There has been a bit of movement on currency markets as well this morning: sterling is down by 0.4% against the US dollar. One pound will buy $1.3195. That in itself is not a huge move, but it puts the pound perilously close to its lowest level since December 2020, when the UK was facing the prospect of belated Christmas restrictions in the hope of limiting the spread of a new coronavirus variant (a familiar tale). If it drops below $1.3165 it will mark a new low for 2021, an unusual situation considering the Bank of England only just last week shocked markets with an interest rate rise - pre-empting the Federal Reserve. However, the Fed has itself also made it clear that it will tighten the US money supply. The prospect of a series of interest rate rises next year has made the dollar more attractive to investors. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the dollar will be, pace the omicron variant, one of the “winners from global growth” during 2022. There has also been a similar bounce on oil markets. The price of Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, is still down by 3.3% today - but that is a recovery from earlier. Brent crude futures were down by as much as 5% earlier this morning, with one barrel for February delivery going for as little as $69. It is now back at $71.30. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, an investing platform, said: Heavy selling has hit the oil markets again this week with WTI and Brent crude both shedding more than 3% extending losses after a week in the red with Brent already ending down 2.6% as the Omicron variant continues to spread, weighing on the demand outlook and market sentiment. The Netherlands’ latest lockdown from Sunday sparked investor concerns of fresh restrictions in Europe and the US to curb the spread of Covid, prompting fears of a near-term economic slowdown. Brent crude has shed more than 17% from the October high, trading in a descending trendline and retracing around 70% of its prior gains from the August trough. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Société Générale, a bank, is in a festive mood - albeit the wrong feast. “It’s a lot more like Halloween than Christmas,” he said: Oil prices, equity indices and bond yields are lower on a mix of omicron concerns and Senator Joe Manchin’s announcement that he won’t vote for President Biden’s spending bill. Just over half an hour after the FTSE 100 slumped further, it has just regained a percentage point. It is now down by just 1.3% at 7,179 points, having earlier dropped by as much as 2.2%. European stocks have also recovered somewhat: Germany’s Dax is now down by 2.2% and France’s Cac 40 is down 1.4%. All the usual disclaimers apply at this point in the year: a fair few investors will have shut up shop for the holidays, and few of those who remain will have planned any major moves in the absence of central bank activity. That means that there will be lower liquidity and fewer buyers to soak up any sales, so moves can be exaggerated. Nevertheless, that is a notable swing over the course of less than an hour. It may have been partly helped by vaccine maker Moderna. It said on Monday (in an interview published at 10am GMT) that a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to offer protection against the omicron variant. Reuters reported: The vaccine maker said the decision to focus on the current vaccine, mRNA-1273, was driven in part by how quickly the recently discovered variant is spreading. The company still plans to develop a vaccine specifically to protect against Omicron, which it hopes to advance into clinical trials early next year. “What we have available right now is 1273,” Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer, said in an interview. “It’s highly effective, and it’s extremely safe. I think it will protect people through the coming holiday period and through these winter months, when we’re going to see the most severe pressure of Omicron.” Some detail on how the UK’s shops fared over the last week - usually one of the the strongest of the year: it was not great. Footfall on and near London’s Oxford Street, the country’s biggest shopping district, was 17% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the New West End Company, which represents about 600 shops. Shopping was 5% below the previous weekend, and across the entire week of the 13th December footfall was down by 29% compared with 2019’s figures. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said businesses were “disappointed” with how the weekend went: With less than five days to go until Christmas day and the probabilities of a circuit-breaker lockdown increasingly on the horizon, the retail and leisure sector is now facing a huge amount of financial uncertainty when it should be enjoying a much needed shot in the arm. We are therefore backing the #BusinessBooster campaign and calling on the government to provide urgent and swift financial support. Temporary measures such as a 100% business rate relief for the first quarter of the year, extension of the VAT reduction and introduction of grants could be the difference between viable businesses avoiding closures and job losses in the new year. The FTSE 100 sell-off has accelerated - it is now down by 2.2%. It has hit the lowest level since the start of December as concern over the spread of the omicron variant ramp up. While the UK government is fielding a lot of questions about parties, the hospitality industry is trying to put the pressure on over the lack of them, given how the current lockdown-lite has affected their bookings. The Guardian’s Joanna Partridge writes: Pubs and restaurants have warned of plummeting sales and “decimated” bookings, as pressure increases on the government to offer urgent financial support to struggling hospitality businesses. The weekend just passed should have been the busiest trading period of the Christmas season, but customers chose to stay away, said Nick Mackenzie, the chief executive of the pub and brewery chain Greene King, which runs 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK. “Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, some parts of the country we are 70%, 80% down on 2019, so the situation is pretty unsustainable,” Mackenzie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. Warnings from the government had led to “lockdown in all but name”, Mackenzie said, and he urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to deliver “quick and effective support”. You can read the full report here: Some interesting detail from the notice detailing the reasons for the errors Standard Chartered made. One key reporting problem was caused by a spreadsheet error in which a workers put the wrong sign - so it read as positive rather than negative. Sure, we all make that kind of mistake, except in this case the error meant the calculation was out by a staggering $10bn. That sounds like a very bad day at the office indeed. Standard Chartered will have to pay £46.5m after it failed to cooperate with regulators at the Bank of England. It was a record fine imposed by the Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is tasked with overseeing the UK banking sector’s financial stability. The fines came in relation to reporting errors related to movements of US dollars, amid concerns in October 2017 about the outflow of cash. StanChart made five errors reporting, which “meant the PRA did not have a reliable overview of its USD liquidity position,” the regulator said on Monday. Yet StanChart failed to report one of the breaches until four months later, following its own internal investigation. Somewhat oddly, however, StanChart still managed to qualify for a discount for agreeing to pay the fine. It would have paid another £20m had it not cooperated when faced with a fine for not cooperating. Sam Woods, the Bank of England’s deputy governor for prudential regulation and chief executive of the PRA, said: We expect firms to notify us promptly of any material issues with their regulatory reporting, which Standard Chartered failed to do in this case. Standard Chartered’s systems, controls and oversight fell significantly below the standards we expect of a systemically important bank, and this is reflected in the size of the fine in this case. Two more companies have edged into positive territory on the FTSE 100 this morning: Royal Mail and Ocado. It appears that investors are expecting a lot of us to be stuck at home sending and receiving parcels, like in previous lockdowns. GlaxoSmithKline has appointed former Tesco chief executive Sir Dave Lewis to oversee its consumer products division once it is split from the main pharmaceutical company, it announced on Monday. Lewis will chair the business, which will make its own way from the middle of 2022 with revenues of about £10bn annually - meaning it will likely join the FTSE 100 when it lists itself on the London Stock Exchange. GSK will give up 80% of the equity to other shareholders, while it focuses on pharma in the hope that investors will appreciate a more targeted business. From 2014 to 2020 Lewis was in charge of Tesco, supervising its recovery from an accounting scandal. Before that he held a senior role at Unilever overseeing its personal care products. Lewis said: GSK Consumer Healthcare is a world-class business with significant prospects and a high-quality leadership team. I am looking forward to being part of its exciting future as an independent company and the very positive impact it can have on people’s health all over the world. It is a very broad-based sell-off; there isn’t much happening on markets beyond the reaction to omicron. The below grab from the terminal shows the extent of the selling among the FTSE 100: only miner Polymetal is in positive territory. Everyone else has lost ground, with travel shares like Rolls-Royce and British Airways owner IAG among the big losers. Events and publishing company Informa doesn’t have much to gain from the prospect of new restrictions either - but to be honest there are potential negative effects for almost any sector if the economic recovery is delayed or even thwarted. And the opening snaps are in - steep declines across Europe as expected: BRITAIN’S FTSE 100 DOWN 1.7% EURO STOXX INDEX DOWN 1.5%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS DOWN 1.4% FRANCE’S CAC 40 DOWN 2.1%, SPAIN’S IBEX DOWN 2.5% No Dax yet - which usually means a big move as it takes a few minutes to calculate. European markets will open very shortly. Futures are still looking painful: the FTSE 100 is pegged for a 1.8% decline. The investment arm of the Qatari state has jumped on board Rolls-Royce’s plans to build small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) which the British engineering stalwart hopes will prove to be a significant new source of revenues. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) will invest £85m for 10% of the project, Rolls-Royce announced on Monday. While not a huge amount of money for a company that burned through about £2bn in the last year, Rolls-Royce will hope that the involvement of the Qatari state, which has huge financial wealth stored up from decades of oil sales, will prove to other investors that the SMR business is the real deal. Rolls-Royce already has the backing of BNF Resources UK Ltd and Exelon Generation Ltd as shareholders in Rolls-Royce SMR - plus £210m from the UK government. Rolls-Royce has had a tough pandemic, as long-haul flights that rely on its engines have been grounded. The omicron variant has dealt it another blow in recent weeks. However, it hopes that the SMRs - modelled on the technology powering nuclear submarines - will be considerably bigger than its existing business as it takes a key role in the transition to net zero carbon emissions. The jury is still out for the investment community. Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud, chief executive of the QIA, said: QIA is investing in the energy transition and funding the technologies that enable low carbon electricity generation. We will continue to seek out investments that align with our mandate to deliver long-term value for future generations through responsible sustainable investments. Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s chief executive, said: I am tremendously pleased to announce that we have further strengthened our relationship with Qatar, through QIA’s investment in the Rolls-Royce SMR business. We have successfully raised the capital we need to establish Rolls-Royce SMR and it is encouraging to confirm that the business is now set up to succeed. Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics, the eurozone and financial markets. Investors have their eyes on one thing this morning: just how bad is the omicron coronavirus going to be for economies across the world. UK and European stock market futures suggest that traders are rattled: the FTSE 100 is on course to fall by 1.9% on opening, while Germany’s Dax benchmark index and France’s Cac 40 are set for declines of 2.4% apiece. The week before Christmas is usually a fairly odd affair on financial markets, as investors lock up their trading terminals and put their feet up. The last two years have been somewhat different. Omicron is the ghost of Christmas past following last year’s holiday lockdowns when the delta coronavirus variant swept across the world. Asian markets have set the tone: Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 2.2%, while China’s SSE Composite index, which covers Shanghai-listed shares, dropped 1.1% and Japan’s broad-based Topix fell 2.2%. There was no sign in the UK of any new restrictions - but that has not stopped a large proportion of the population from locking down in order to save themselves from a Christmas period of self-isolation. Pubs and restaurants say their business has evaporated like England’s batting lineup. Neither over the weekend have we seen any action from the UK government to help hospitality companies whose Christmas trading period has been destroyed - although health secretary Sajid Javid trailed the possibility of restrictions to come yesterday. The calls for support have been flooding in, including so far this morning from the bosses of restaurant chain Franco Manca, pub chain Greene King, and the boss of the City of London Corporation, which runs London’s central business district, which is already looking like the ghost of Christmas future. Instead, the government is fighting yet another battle over its apparent habit of holding gatherings during lockdowns. Here is the Guardian exclusive picture that has sparked the latest round of criticisms: Deputy prime minister and secretary of state for justice Dominic Raab has this morning opined that the wine and cheese evening constituted work. And let’s not forget that the under-pressure government also faced the resignation of the man who had been tasked with renegotiating key parts of the UK’s trading arrangement with its largest trading partner, the EU. Foreign secretary Liz Truss will take charge of talks over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which Boris Johnson signed up to just two years ago to rush a Brexit deal through."
"In Britain it’s alcohol, in Canada it’s maple syrup, while in Australia it’s a crucial additive for diesel trucks, and in New Zealand it’s brown sugar. These are just some of the many shortages affecting consumers and businesses around the world as industry experts warn that the supply chain crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic could last for many more months and even up to two years. Although there are signs that some bottlenecks are easing, the onset of the Omicron Covid variant could lead to new shutdowns, sending another disruptive spasm through the global system. The gravest appears to be an outbreak of Covid this week in the Chinese manufacturing hub of Zhejiang, which is home to the world’s largest cargo port, Ningbo-Zhoushan. Tens of thousands are in quarantine under China’s strict zero-Covid policy and some local authorities have urged workers not to travel home “unnecessarily” for lunar new year festival in February. “Further supply chain disruption is a significant possibility,” economic analysts at Capital Economics said in a note. Industry experts and economists believe the problems could persist as the finely calibrated network of world trade, already weakened by months of shipping backlogs, labour shortages and geopolitical tensions, remains “discombobulated”. Maersk, one of the big three shipping companies, said the worst delays were still on the US west coast where ships were waiting four weeks to unload due to the lack of workers on land. This creates a chaotic “ripple effect” around the world with ships locked into tight deadlines and a glut of containers in some ports in the US and Europe, but not enough in ports throughout Asia. “With winter, year-end holidays in North America and Europe, Chinese new year in Asia, the already stretched supply chain will get even further stretched as workers, truckers and terminals are off for holidays,” a Maersk spokesperson said. “Normally we can absorb these seasonal impacts fairly quickly, but when already stretched, it just becomes a multiplier,.” “We do not see major improvements as long as we have line of sight, which is into 2022 ... Very likely that it continues thereafter and for North America even longer.” In Felixstowe, the UK’s biggest container port, the dockside remains clogged with containers waiting to be emptied, meaning that empty containers coming back on trucks from inland warehouses have to be diverted to other ports. Robert Keen, of the British International Freight Association, said driver shortages were being felt all over the world with port infrastructure not keeping pace with the container vessels. Covid was “an ongoing problem”, he said. Flavio Macau, an associate professor specialising in supply chains at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia, said that fine-tuning could take years and that the world economy was still suffering from a kind of “high blood pressure” as it lurched from one disruption to another. “Lockdowns are hopefully a thing of the past outside China, but there are still all kinds of restrictions in place to the movement of people, including workers with in-demand skills. “My view is that supply chains still have high blood pressure, consistently showing arrhythmia. It will take to mid-2024 to get back to “normal’.” As well as the possible shortages of Christmas drinks and sugar for festive treats, economies such as the UK and US are facing rising inflation across a range of goods from energy to apples as a torrent of demand puts pressure on insufficient supply. Shipping accounts for the movement of at least 90% of goods around the world and the cost of transporting things by sea has rocketed in the past year. For example, the Drewry world container index measuring the cost of moving a 40ft container is 170% higher than it was a year ago. The price on some particularly in-demand routes such as Shanghai to Rotterdam has increased by almost 200%; in the case of the Dutch port to New York, the cost has risen by 212%. Basic consumer staples are spiralling in price because of higher shipping costs and heightened demand from consumers stuck at home for months and unable to spend any money on treats such as holidays and nights out. Coffee prices have doubled over the past year, according to current data, as has the price of oats. Lumber, cotton, wheat and palm oil have all risen by more than 30%. Not surprisingly, inflation has touched decades-long highs in western economies such as the US, Britain and Germany, bringing calls for an end to the ultra-loose monetary policies pursued by central banks since 2008. Roy Cummins, who has worked in logistics for 30 years and until recently was chief executive of the Port of Brisbane in Australia, said there was some sense that things were improving but he estimated that constraints on the international shipping network were unlikely to be alleviated for the next two years. His point is illustrated by the bottleneck of giant containers that has built up off the west coast of the US. With so many ships unable to dock and unload, more than 80% of the 434,000 20ft containers exported out of the Port of Los Angeles in September went out empty. Shipping companies can make up to eight times more money taking goods from China to the US, so it made sense to get the containers back to Asia rather than wait for them to be filled. This has fulled huge imbalances throughout the system, he said: “The supply chains were discombobulated. Shipping capacity was quickly exhausted at the start of the pandemic because everyone planned for a big decline in demand but in fact there was a surge because people wanted to buy things. Then the supply side was hit hard with ports, warehouses and truck companies all short of workers. “But you can’t flick a switch and get new capacity back on. New ships are not ready until 2023. Shipping supply should normalise within a year but does the economy normalise?” Tiffany Compres, a partner at international law firm FisherBroyles based in Florida, said: “It will take time to get better, for companies to adjust, and for the legal framework to adapt. To add to the challenge, this is very much a political issue, and nations will need to cooperate to really get us to a new sustainable way of operating the supply chain. It seems to be a tall order in our polarized era.” Before the pandemic struck, the shipping industry had driven down the cost of transporting goods and had perfected the celebrated “just-in-time” system whereby commodities and spare parts were moved seamlessly around the globe and delivered exactly when and where they were needed. This reduced corporate costs dramatically, for example by reducing or completely eradicating the need for on-site warehousing. If the uncertainty continues and consumers carry on with online shopping splurges, Cummins says, “you will see ‘just-in-time’ becoming ‘just-in-case’ as companies build up inventories to guard against disruptions”. Dennis Unkovic, a US corporate lawyer, trade expert and author of Transforming the Global Supply Chain, says the Covid crisis had shown that the system was dependent on a just-in-time model designed to run perfectly, “but that’s not what’s happened”. The deterioration in relations between the US and China which led to trade tariffs and loss of trust was also having a bigger impact than hitherto recognised, he says, dislocating the mechanics of world trade that have been taken for granted for many years. Cyber-attacks and robotics have also made companies review their supply chains and source materials closer to home. “For anyone expecting the post-pandemic world to return to ‘normal’, forget it. Whatever was considered normal before the pandemic is not coming back. “Companies have to make the supply chain a priority,” he says. “If it breaks down we can’t say we didn’t see it coming.”"
"A British cheesemaker who predicted Brexit would cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds in exports has called the UK’s departure from the EU single market a disaster, after losing his entire wholesale and retail business in the bloc over the past year. Simon Spurrell, the co-founder of the Cheshire Cheese Company, said personal advice from a government minister to pursue non-EU markets to compensate for his losses had proved to be “an expensive joke”. “It turns out our greatest competitor on the planet is the UK government because every time they do a fantastic deal, they kick us out of that market – starting with the Brexit deal,” he said. Spurrell predicted in January that Brexit would cost him £250,000 in sales. “We lost £270,000, so I got one thing right,” he said, describing the post-Brexit EU trade deal as the “biggest disaster that any government has ever negotiated in the history of trade negotiations”. His online retail business was hit immediately after the Brexit negotiator David Frost failed to secure a frictionless trade deal addressing sales to individual customers in the EU. Spurrell said he had lost 20% of sales overnight after discovering he needed to provide a £180 health certificate on each order, including gift packs costing £25 or £30. He said the viability of his online retail had come to a “dead stop”. After he embarked on a personal crusade to draw attention to the plight of UK exporters involving almost 200 media interviews around the world, he was invited to an online meeting with Victoria Prentis, a minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She suggested that emerging markets could compensate for the Brexit-related hole in the Cheshire Cheese Company’s finances. Spurrell said he had pursued new business in Norway and Canada but post-Brexit trade deals sealed by the government had put barriers in place. “We no longer have any ability to deal with the EU as our three distributors in Germany, France and Italy have said we have become too expensive because of the new checks and paperwork. “And now we’ve also lost Norway since the trade deal, as duty for wholesale is 273%. Then we tried Canada but what the government didn’t tell us is that duty of 244% is applied on any consignment over $20 [£15].” That meant Canadian customers who ordered a gift pack worth £50, including transport fees, were asked to pay £178 extra in duty when the courier arrived at their door, Spurrell said. “As you can imagine, customers were saying: ‘You can take that back, we don’t want it anymore’.” Norwegian duty on a £30 cheese pack amounted to £190 extra, he said. Spurrell is now pursuing the domestic market with greater vigour but says the cost of marketing has gone “through the roof” because all his competitors are having to do the same. “Before we could sell across the EU, now we are all fishing in the same pond. We used to be the biggest online sellers but now we are absolutely bombarded with attacks by all our cheese rivals because they are buying all the ads on Google to try to beat us. These are competitors who would never have bothered us before,” he said. The “sad” thing, Spurrell said, is that it is the small to medium-sized companies such as his, important employers up and down the country, have been hammered by Brexit and other trade deals struck by the government, rather than giant rivals. He noted that the Canadian company Saputo, with a market capital of more than C$14bn (£8.3bn), had done well out of the Norwegian deal as producers of three of the four “premier” cheeses singled out for “significantly reduced tariffs”."
"The celebrity makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury’s company has repaid £3.2m in furlough money after sales soared during the pandemic as shoppers switched to buying online. Accounts filed at Companies House also reveal that Tilbury sold her business for £1.3bn – considerably more than the up to £1bn previously thought – to the Spanish cosmetics and fragrance group Puig last year. The scale of the deal means that Tilbury, who personally held a controlling stake in the business of between 50% and 75%, is likely to have received hundreds of millions from the takeover of the company in which she remains a minority shareholder. The London-born makeup artist, who grew up on the Spanish island of Ibiza, also received a consultancy fee of £1.55m from one of the group’s parent companies, Islestarr Holdings, last year, according to Companies House filings. Global sales for Charlotte Tilbury Limited Group rose 11.3% to £258.5m in the year to 31 December 2020, according to figures released by the company, driven by strong performances in key markets including the UK, mainland Europe and Asia. While its stores were forced to close for long periods, the cosmetics group said online sales doubled to account for two-thirds of total sales. Sales were underpinned by online video beauty consultations and a virtual store featuring an avatar of Tilbury, and the firm also continued with new product launches when some rivals held back. Tilbury’s tips learned from years in the trade, with celebrity clients thought to include Amal Clooney and Penélope Cruz, have helped her build a big social media presence with about 10m followers over various platforms enabling the company to continue to thrive during the coronavirus pandemic. The group fell to a £9.9m loss before tax for the year, after more than £29m in one-off costs related to its buyout by Puig. However, a spokesperson said the company had repaid furlough cash as underlying profits, before one-off costs, interest payments and other adjustments, rose almost 44% to £32m. “We would like to thank the UK government for its support,” the spokesperson said. Alongside Tilbury’s business, Barcelona-based Puig owns brands including Paco Rabanne, Jean Paul Gaultier and Nina Ricci."
"Households will be urged to take only 30 seconds out of their day to reduce their energy use as a UK government TV advertising campaign designed to cut bills finally launches. The advert, part of an £18m campaign originally blocked by Liz Truss, will air during festive schedules from 8.30am on Tuesday on terrestrial and satellite channels, including ITV, Channel 4 and Sky. The advert suggests Britons should spend 30 seconds taking small actions such as turning down their boiler flow, switching off lights, closing curtains at night or reducing washing machine temperatures. The advert states: “This is a 30-second ad – that’s not long but it’s long enough to do something that could save you money on your energy bills … “Each one you do will be 30 seconds well spent, they all add up and could save you money.” The Guardian revealed earlier this month that the campaign was finally due to start with digital and outdoor adverts from 17 December, under the strapline “It all adds up”. The campaign launched with a social media video in which the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, encourages people to save money while battling with a pesky Elf on the Shelf. UK ministers had been urged to launch the campaign since the summer as officials elsewhere in Europe began asking businesses, public bodies and citizens to cut usage amid high energy bills and concerns over a shortage of gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the UK the government was ready to launch a campaign in October but the move was blocked by Truss, who opposed a “nanny state” intervention. Ministers have been careful not to advocate anything that would endanger public health amid fears efforts to cut energy bills will endanger lives this winter. Last week fire authorities urged householders to take care when using candles, wood burners and electric heaters to cut energy bills this Christmas after a spate of recent house fires. Critics have argued the campaign has launched too late to make a real difference this winter and many households have already made every effort to cut their bills. The government stepped in to cushion the blow of rising energy bills through its energy price guarantee, which caps typical annual household bills at £2,500 until April and £3,000 after that for a further year. The business and energy minister Lord Callanan said: “The government’s ‘It All Adds Up’ energy-saving campaign is already getting important information out to millions of households across the country, showing them simple, low and no-cost tips to cut their energy use and bills this winter. “Simple steps can make a big difference to cutting bills, while keeping homes warm and safe, and by launching this new TV advert, even more people will be aware and the savings will keep adding up for UK households.”"
"Fire authorities have urged householders to take care when using candles, wood burners and electric heaters to cut energy bills this Christmas after a spate of recent house fires. Flat fires in Uxbridge and Harwich this month were caused by candles; fire chiefs in Cumbria, Hereford and Worcester reported more fires as householders used unswept chimneys and candles; and last month in Wakefield a blaze was caused by a tumble dryer being used overnight to save money. Ofgem figures released on Thursday showed the average annual electricity bill was £1,297, compared with £815 last year, and average annual gas bills went from £602 to £1,336, an 86% rise in total. Soaring food prices mean the ingredients of a typical Christmas dinner are up almost 30% on last year. “Many people are understandably seeking ways to reduce costs and save money as we try to manage soaring energy bills and the impact of inflation,” said Frank Biederman, a Devon county councillor and chair of the Local Government Association’s fire services management committee. “It is vital that this is not at the expense of staying safe … we are urging people to prevent a tragedy by following a few simple safety steps, including making sure you have working smoke alarms in your home and test them regularly, which could save your or a loved one’s life.” It said candles should never be left unattended, flammable furniture and drying clothes should be kept away from heaters and fires, correct fuel should be used for wood-burning stoves, and open fires and chimneys must be swept. Energy operators have said there has been a 400% rise in incidents of people interfering with gas and electricity meters between 2017 and 2021 and predicted the trend would continue this year with a further 16% rise. Police discovered that a fatal fire in Glasgow was started by a spark from a prepayment meter that had been illegally bypassed. The Energy Networks Association said operators are seeing DIY attempts at meter tampering that frequently lead to live electricity conductors being exposed or unsealed holes in gas supply pipes. The National Fire Chiefs Council has said accidental fires in the home caused by candles in England totalled 940 in the year ending March 2022, the highest recorded in more than 10 years. About a third of these fires resulted in death or injury. “NFCC is concerned these figures could rise as many members of the public understandably look at ways to deal with rising costs as inflation rates increase,” it said."
"Russian oil revenues fell last month despite a boost in production to just below levels before the invasion of Ukraine, the International Energy Agency has said, in a sign that western efforts to choke off the Kremlin’s income are working. The IEA estimated that Russia earned about $15.8bn (£12.8bn) from oil sales in November, the second lowest this year after $14.7bn in September. The revenue fall came despite a rise in Russia’s exports of crude oil and products to 8.1m barrels a day, the highest level since April, two months after Russia invaded Ukraine. It is a positive signal for western countries hoping to curb the Kremlin’s funding from energy exports, which represent Russia’s largest source of revenues. The EU and G7 introduced a $60-a-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne oil on 5 December as governments sought to strike a balance between cutting the Kremlin’s revenues and keeping control of fuel price inflation. The price of non-Russian oil was about $81 a barrel on Wednesday. Industry watchers have questioned how effective the cap will be because Russian oil is already trading below $60 a barrel. The IEA said the country’s export crude blend, Urals, slid to about $43 a barrel as of early December. The cap, which led to a build-up of tankers off Turkey in its immediate aftermath of its introduction, restricted access to insurance and shipping services for any buyers of Russian oil that refuse to adhere to the threshold. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed the cap will not have a significant impact on the country’s economy but could harm the international energy market and force Russia to cut production. His US counterpart, Joe Biden, was angered when the Opec+ oil cartel cut production by 2m barrels per day (bpd) in a decision led by Russia and Saudi Arabia in October. The IEA predicts Russia’s oil output will fall by 1.4m barrels per day (bpd) next year. “While lower oil prices come as a welcome relief to consumers faced by surging inflation, the full impact of embargoes on Russian crude and product supplies remains to be seen,” the agency said. It added that global oil demand growth would slow next year but would still be at a robust 1.7% as China recovers from Covid-related economic restrictions. It predicted China’s oil demandwould contract by 400,000 bpd to 15.4m this year before recovering by almost a million bpd in 2023. The agency said global oil demand in 2022 had increased by 2.3m bpd compared with last year, and was predicted to rise by 1.7m next year to 101.6m bpd."
"Australia’s jobless rate remained steady in November even as the economy added about 2,000 jobs a day, underscoring the tight conditions in the labour market. The unemployment rate last month was 3.4% with employers taking on 64,000 extra positions, more than half of them full-time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Economists from the ANZ and CBA forecast the rate would remain at October’s 3.4% rate with a net increase of about 15,000 to 20,000 jobs. Joblessness has been near 50-year lows for much of 2022 as a rebounding economy after the Covid restrictions were eased combined with fewer overseas students and other short-term visa holders to produce a tight labour market. During the September quarter, a record one in 30 jobs were vacant compared with about half that ratio before the pandemic. The strength of the labour market will be monitored closely by the Reserve Bank of Australia as it watches for signs of a jump in wages that has so far failed to materialise for most sectors. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup After eight rate rises in as many months, the RBA board is not scheduled to meet again until February. Prior to today’s jobs numbers, investors were split between predicting another 25 basis point rise to 3.35% or a pause for that next gathering. Most of the labour market figures were upbeat, particularly the increase in the participation rate by 0.2 percentage points to match a record 66.8% set earlier in 2022. Economists had tipped the rate would be unchanged. “The participation rate increased by 0.2 percentage points to 66.8% November, returning to the record high we saw in June 2022,” the head of labour statistics at the ABS, Bjorn Jarvis, said. “It was 1.0 percentage point higher than before the pandemic.” The recovery in those looking for work in Australia post-pandemic is in contrast to the US, where a lot more people have not returned to the labour market, which partly explains that country’s much faster wage growth with a similar jobless rate. Australian women’s participation rate is also back to matching its historical high of June at 62.4%. For men, it was 71.3%. The workforce swelled to 13.77 million people last month, seasonally adjusted, reaching its latest record. Unemployment and underemployment levels are at about two-thirds of the level they were at in March 2020 before the pandemic. Rising Covid cases continued to drag on the economy, with those working fewer hours because of illness up by 50,000 last month to 520,000, about a third higher than would be typical for this time of year, the ABS said. Monthly hours worked sank slightly to 1.9bn. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, welcomed the latest jobs figures, but said “Australia won’t be immune to the volatile global economic environment driving higher global inflation and slowing growth.” EY’s senior economist, Paula Gadsby, said the labour market had maintained “its stellar performance”. “The ongoing strength of the labour market was being reflected in the resilience of household consumption – as witnessed in last week’s national accounts – despite rising interest rates and cost of living,” Gadsby said. “There is minimal spare capacity in the labour market, and forward indicators suggest employment will slow. “As households eventually pull back on spending, businesses will face heightened uncertainty and likely falls in demand, together with continued inflation and wage pressures.” The chief economist with Beta Shares, David Bassanese, said the “bumper” jobs report argued against any pause in the RBA’s rate rise at its February rates meeting. “Indeed, contrary to all the negativity around rising interest rates, the major story of 2022 has been the economy’s resilience to date in the face of interest rate hikes,” he said. Among the states and territories, the ACT claimed bragging rights as the jurisdiction with the lowest unemployment rate. Last month it sank to 2.9% in trend terms from 3.1% in October, the ABS said. (Seasonally adjusted it was down to 2.5%.) Most states held their own in trend terms, with New South Wales the lowest among the big states, remaining at a jobless rate of 3.2%, while Victoria’s edged 0.1 percentage points higher to 3.6%."
"Superdry has secured an £80m new loan facility before a January deadline as it warns of “extremely challenging” trading conditions in the UK leading up to Christmas. The fashion brand and retailer warned in October that “a material uncertainty exists” as to whether it would remain a going concern as it negotiated the new debt facility. On Thursday, it said it had agreed a new loan including a £30m three-year deal with specialist lender Bantry Bay Capital, a firm backed by the hedge fund Elliott Advisers, but admitted it had to pay a much higher interest rate than on its £70m facility, which was set to expire in late January “given market conditions”. Shares in the company jumped more than 15% on the news, which comes as a number of retail businesses are struggling to secure new borrowing facilities due to fears of a consumer downturn and rising interest rates. Retailers including Matalan and Wilko have sought to raise new cash – with Elliott or Bantry Bay thought to be involved in both sets of discussions – while online specialists such as Asos and Boohoo are thought to be struggling to adapt to a slump in online demand as shoppers rein in spending on nonessentials as energy and grocery bills soar. Julian Dunkerton, the founder and chief executive of Superdry, said that “extremely challenging” trading conditions “weren’t helped by the unseasonably warm weather in October and into November”. He added: “We are under no illusions that consumer confidence is fragile and that the picture is unlikely to change quickly.” However, he said the company was “very pleased” to have completed its refinancing which meant the business was “in good shape as we trade through our important Christmas trading period”. Dunkerton said the company had traded well since the end of October with a return to cold weather and “record levels of jacket sales over the Black Friday period”. That came after Superdry increased sales by 3.6% in the six months to 29 October as shoppers flooded back into stores – lifting instore sales by 14.4% – and continued to buy online. However, wholesale sales slid 5.2%, partly because of low demand during a warm October, and profit margins slumped 2 percentage points partly because of the pressure on wholesale demand. “Our [autumn-winter] collection has been really well received by customers, especially our jacket range and party dresses, and it’s great to see store sales recovering well. I am also encouraged with how we have started the second half,” Dunkerton said."
"UK inflation declined at the sharpest rate in 16 months to 10.7% in November as the momentum behind the rising cost of clothing and petrol began to ease amid growing fears of a long recession. The drop in the consumer prices index figure was slightly bigger than expected by most City analysts, who forecast the annual rate of price rises would slide to 10.9% last month, from 11.1% in October. However, prices were still rising, albeit at a slower rate, and the increasing costs will add to the pressure on ministers to put up wages across the public sector to close the gap between earnings and rising prices. The measure of inflation used by most trade unions as the basis for annual pay claims – the retail prices index – fell only marginally from 14.2% to 14% in November. Forecasts of a recession lasting until the end of 2023 have triggered falls in the price of crude oil since last year, bringing down the cost of transport. Meanwhile, the rising cost of clothing has begun to wane, forcing retailers in Europe and the US to increase stockpiles as consumers pull back from replenishing their wardrobes. Fuel prices rose by 17.2% in the year to November 2022, down from a 22.2% increase in the year to October, while prices of clothing and footwear rose by 7.5% – down from an 8.5% annual inflation rate in October. Secondhand car prices also played a part in the easing back of inflation. Prices fell by 5.8% in the year to November, having jumped by more than 31% between March and November 2021. The Office for National Statistics said the cost of hospitality, hotels and restaurant food played the biggest role in pushing prices higher in November by 10.2% from 9.6% in October. Bank of England officials are expected to come under intense pressure to increase interest rates when they meet on Thursday to set the central bank’s base interest rate. The monetary policy committee is predicted to push the base rate up by 0.5 percentage points to 3.5%. MPC members are known to be concerned that double-digit inflation will trigger a wave of high wage claims, leading to a further round of price rises next year. So far, figures for wage claims across the private and public sector average only 4%, leading to large falls in average living standards. Jack Leslie, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “Britain may now be past its inflation peak, which is good news for policymakers at both the Bank and Treasury as they grapple with rising interest rates and public debt. “But with price rises still massively outstripping pay rises – and Britain’s poorest families facing an inflation rate of over 12% – families are still getting poorer month on month, and the cost of living crisis will continue to deepen in 2023.” Jeremy Hunt said he expected the UK’s economic situation would get worse before it began to improve. The chancellor added: “The aftershocks of Covid-19 and Putin’s weaponisation of gas mean high inflation is plaguing economies across Europe, and I know families and businesses are struggling here in the UK. “Getting inflation down so people’s wages go further is my top priority, which is why we are holding down energy bills this winter through our energy price guarantee scheme and implementing a plan to help halve inflation next year.” Inflation has begun falling in most major industrialised countries after a decline in the cost of petrol and a slower rate of price growth for many high street items, including clothing. Figures released on Tuesday showed annual consumer price inflation in the US slowed to 7.1% in November, down from 7.7% in October."
"For those of us who were there, the rows over pay, the strikes, the picket lines and an ineffectual government bring it all back. Britain is facing its 2022 equivalent of the late 1970s’ winter of discontent. It was bitterly cold back then, too. Rishi Sunak’s approach to the widespread industrial action is clear. The government will warn that excessively high wage deals risk entrenching inflation. It will argue that the recommendations of the public sector pay review bodies (PRBs) are reasonable and must be adhered to. And it will wait for support for action to crumble as striking workers contemplate the harsh reality of lost pay at a time of a cost of living crisis, and gradually give up the fight. Trade union membership has halved since its peak in 1979, but there are still circumstances in which workers acting collectively can exert some serious muscle, and this is one of them. It is not just that unemployment is at 3.7%, among the lowest levels in half a century, it is that the supply of workers has been affected by people leaving the labour market during the pandemic. Nor can employers simply fill vacancies by whistling up workers from the EU as they could pre-Brexit. Demand for workers in the past year has exceeded the available supply, and that has given unions clout they have not had in decades. No question, Sunak’s attempt to hold the line on pay is being made more difficult by the fact that the labour market is tight. There are some signs – a fall in the number of vacancies – that demand for workers is easing but it is very early days. It will take more than the small drop in private sector employment detected by the latest purchasing managers’ index to tip the balance of power in wage negotiations back in favour of employers. What’s more, most of the industrial action is in the public sector, or what was the public sector before privatisation. It is, therefore, no surprise to find groups of workers asking to be compensated for the sharp rise in the cost of living over the past year. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show annual earnings growth in the public sector of 2.7% while inflation is running at 10.7%. You don’t need to be a genius to work out why workers are unhappy. The government continues to point to the recommendations of independent pay review review bodies as a reason for not negotiating with unions, but this is an unconvincing argument for three reasons. First, the eight separate pay review bodies are not really independent, in that the government sets a remit and a spending envelope that binds them. Second, the PRBs have limited union representation, which sets them apart from the Low Pay Commission, which is responsible for making recommendations about the minimum wage. Third, the government can bypass the PRBs and engage directly with the unions, and there are plenty of examples of this happening in recent years. When he was health secretary in 2014, Jeremy Hunt rejected the NHS PRB recommendation of a 1% pay increase for NHS staff, insisting on a 0% freeze instead. This prompted industrial action by nine health unions, which resulted in the government finally accepting the PRB recommendation in full. Lesley Mercer, a former trade union leader who was once a member of the armed forces PRB, says: “It is bizarre to suggest that pay review body recommendations are binding on government. The clue is in the name: recommendations. In practice, governments decide whether or not to accept a recommendation. It is a matter of record that the recommendations from the armed forces review body in 2018 were not accepted in full.” Opinion polls suggest the public isn’t buying Sunak’s argument that the government is being reasonable and fair. Again, that’s hardly surprising. For a start, many of the workers who are taking industrial action were on the frontline during the pandemic lockdowns. It is not so long ago that people stood outside their homes and clapped for the nurses – something that has not been forgotten. But that’s not all. Median wages adjusted for inflation are barely any higher now than they were at the start of the global financial crisis 15 years ago. The real pay of nurses is lower than it was when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Over the same period, ultra-low interest rates and the money creation process known as quantitative easing have boosted asset prices, particularly for the already well-off. It doesn’t really help the government in its battle for hearts and minds that Sunak is the richest prime minister the UK has ever had. Certainly, the UK’s experience of the 70s and 80s highlights the dangers of a wage-price spiral, because, once embedded, high inflation proved hard and painful to shift. But with earnings growth falling well short of price increases, and the Bank of England forecasting inflation will be well below its 2% target within two years, such fears seem overblown. Ultimately all roads lead back to the Treasury. Hunt, with the support of Sunak, is in effect trying to impose an incomes policy on workers who are strongly unionised, have a genuine grievance and enjoy plenty of public support. Some Conservatives see the need for a bit of flexibility because they don’t see this ending well for the government. They are right to be concerned. Ted Heath carried the can when a miners’ overtime ban resulted in a three-day week in early 1974. Jim Callaghan was booted out of office in the aftermath of the winter of discontent. The evidence is that voters are again blaming the politicians for the disruption caused by the strikes. • This article was amended on 19 December 2022. An overtime ban by miners, rather than a strike, led to the 1974 three-day week."
"A seven-year-old girl was raped in insecure accommodation at a factory producing clothes for Tesco in Thailand while her mother sewed F&amp;F jeans late in the evening, it has been revealed. Her mother said she had been working unpaid overtime until 10pm, after which she returned to her room to find her daughter bleeding and in distress, having been raped by a colleague. She said an assistant manager at the factory told her not to call an ambulance because clinicians might call the police. The girl and her mother are both claimants in a landmark lawsuit being brought in England against Tesco on behalf of 130 Burmese former workers at the VK Garment (VKG) factory, who are suing for alleged negligence and unjust enrichment. Tesco, which was not involved in the day to day running of the factory, said it only became aware of the incident this year and that had it been alerted to it at the time it happened, it would have ended its relationship with VKG immediately. Workers at VKG made jeans and other F&amp;F clothes for adults and children between 2017 and 2020 that were supplied to the Thai arm of Tesco’s business. Tesco said the garments were sold only on the Thai market, although the Guardian has seen images of labels written in English on clothes made there. Profits from sales in Thailand went back to the UK. The attack happened on 4 August 2018 while the girl was sleeping in the room with her younger sister. A 19-year-old man who lived in an adjoining room was able to walk in because their room only had a scrap of fabric for a door and thin walls that did not reach the ceiling. The rapist, who also worked at the factory, was sentenced to five years and four months in prison in December 2018. The girl’s mother recalled arriving back at their room at about 10pm to find her oldest daughter bleeding and distraught. “She told me: ‘Mummy, someone came and did bad things to me.’” The mother, whom the Guardian is not naming, said her brother managed to catch the man, but that the factory “did nothing”. She said an assistant manager at VKG had been more worried about police checks at the factory than helping her daughter. “He said: ‘Don’t call the ambulance. If you call the ambulance, the police will come and that will make trouble for our factory, so don’t call them.’” She added: “I felt helpless because I was working in their country, I didn’t have any background here, we only depended on the factory and we had no one to help us.” In the end she said a social worker for another factory in the compound called an ambulance and the police, and they went to Mae Sot general hospital. She said nobody from VKG spoke to her about what happened but a manager from the factory did visit the hospital and gave her about £20. “I feel it is up to VKG and Tesco to take responsibility for my daughter’s case but they haven’t,” she said. “I worked and lived in the factory when the case happened, I informed them and they didn’t even call an ambulance. They didn’t take any responsibility for us.” The mother, whose trauma was evident when she described her daughter’s ordeal, said she had always been worried about the children staying in the top-floor room alone but previously her main concern had been her toddler falling on the steep steps. She said she was made to feel bad for checking on her children every few hours and was shouted at about it, even though she was paid only for what she could make. Along with many other parents at the factory, she felt she had no choice but to work while her children were unsupervised, in order to earn enough to feed her family. “I felt unsafe in the dormitory that VKG provided to us,” she said, and explained that while she was working, she worried about her children because there were steep stairs and “was afraid they would fall down or something would happen”. She said that she sewed about 5,000 pairs of F&amp;F jeans and trousers a month and would work as fast as she could in order to buy time to enable her to run and check on the children. She said she worked until at least 10pm every night except Sunday – sometimes right through the night. She says she was usually paid about £4 a day, well below the £7 Thai minimum wage at the time and that depended on how much she could make. “This has been really terrible for my family,” she continued. “Even though we try and forget the past, of what happened at VKG, we cannot forget it easily. When I was working there I made just enough money to get food to feed our mouths. It was not an easy way to live. I made just enough for our family to survive.” The family moved to Thailand in 2005 after struggling to find work in Myanmar, but now they are in debt and her husband is ill with kidney problems. “My hope was that I would save money working in Thailand and then go back to Myanmar and settle down with the money I saved in Thailand,” the mother recalled. “But it did not happen and now I can’t even go back. Anna Barr, a solicitor at Leigh Day, the law firm bringing the case, said: “The disturbing sexual violence experienced by the child claimant is absolutely abhorrent and a profound infringement of her physical and psychological integrity. “The mother and child claimant are deeply traumatised. They argue in their legal case that their living conditions were clearly unsafe and privacy and security were dangerously limited. The claimants argue that the Tesco defendants committed to preventing human rights abuses in their supply chain and should have taken adequate steps to ensure that this abuse did not happen.” A spokesperson for Tesco said: “This is an horrific incident and our thoughts go out to the victim and everyone affected by it. Had we been alerted to it at the time it took place, we would have ended our relationship with this supplier immediately. Unfortunately we were not made aware until earlier this year, more than a year after the sale of our business in Asia.” Sirikul Tatiyawongpaibul, the managing director of VKG, did not comment on the specific details of the rape case but called the allegations of the 21 workers interviewed by the Guardian “hearsay”. She said their claims about working conditions should be presented in court and could not be commented on, given an ongoing case in the Thai labour courts. She said: “The company’s rules and regulations are in line with Thailand’s labour law, with employment and working conditions, in line with conditions laid out by the department of labour protection and welfare, and customers … The company has fought the case with facts and does not plan to shut down operations. It is necessary for the company to demand justice under Thailand’s judicial process.” Many workers at the factory lived in the accommodation provided on site, which consisted of overcrowded rooms with concrete floors to sleep on and dirty pond water in a bucket to wash. Workers said the rooms on the upstairs floor had no door, just a curtain, and the thin walls did not reach the ceiling, offering no security. Several other workers described children roaming the factory floor or waiting in rooms because their parents could not afford childcare. One family described having to rush their two-year-old daughter to hospital after a heavy machine fell on her leg while she played on a hammock tied to it. Her parents said the incident took place at about 10pm and said the manager told the father not to tell police it had happened at the factory. The X-ray came back clear but they said it was a near-miss that their daughter was not more seriously injured. The girl’s mother, Myat Su Mon, 31, said: “We had to bring our child to work. It’s unsafe for children but we didn’t have a choice. We had to continue our work. “The factory is a bad place and it’s difficult to work there and take care of children. But at the same time we have to have money so we have to work.”"
"Michael Lewis is not used to friends taking a keen interest in his job. But the energy crisis, which has driven dozens of suppliers under, has turned the tables for E.ON’s UK chief executive. “I never thought I’d be standing at a friend’s birthday party explaining the system marginal pricing of the electricity market,” he laughs. “But there I was, and I had an audience. They want to understand what happened – you explain why 29 suppliers failed and they’re saying: ‘Oh really? And we’re all paying for that?’” The crisis has shone a light on the darkest corners of the industry, as ministers, officials and the public attempt to fathom and fix a situation that has cost customers billions of pounds and sent bills soaring. As the boss of Britain’s second largest energy supplier, behind British Gas, Lewis has seen his share of upstart rivals shaking up the market before crashing spectacularly. “We’re highly critical of the fact that numerous companies entered the market with no capital on their balance sheet, using customers’ money to fund their business and ultimately leaving a trail of destruction,” he says. “We need to learn from that and make sure that we don’t let companies *** CV Age 55 Family Married with two grownup children.

Located in Farringdon, central London, the hidden plant is a labyrinth of industrial pipework that provides district heating, cooling and electricity to the densely populated area. Its hotchpotch of brickwork – from smooth Victorian orange tones to grey breeze blocks – reflects engineering through the generations from its origins in 1894. In one room, huge combined heat and power generators are on standby; in another, a four-storey thermal store sits in a room once used to keep meat from the neighbouring Smithfield market cool. Hot water is piped to draughty, grandiose buildings nearby, including Guildhall, at up to 90C. Slick, well-insulated new offices are supplied at lower temperatures. As Lewis speaks, the water in the jug on the table bounces, Jurassic Park-style, as generators and tube trains rumble below. Lewis praises the government’s energy price guarantee, which is designed to limit typical household bills to £2,500 this winter. But he’s already fretting over its rise to £3,000 from next April. The decision not to repeat the £400 one-off payment given to each household this autumn will make the jump even steeper. “It’s a massive increase – there’s a group of people who are not getting support through the welfare system: the squeezed middle. There’s going to be real pressure on average households,” says Lewis. He is particularly concerned that vulnerable customers may need more short-term targeted support, which is funnelled through universal credit payments – although he adds that E.ON, which has 5.4 million UK residential customers, is yet to see a “big uptick in bad debts”. Long-term, he is behind the idea of a “social tariff”, a targeted discount energy deal for qualifying low-income consumers. For better-off consumers, he would like to see a “relative price cap” that allows them to shop around for the best deals without penalising loyal customers. “That’s the best way of continuing to have a vibrant, competitive market that doesn’t leave people behind. In the past, people who are perhaps less savvy ended up on the highest tariffs,” he says, sipping from an E.ON branded mug. Lewis didn’t set out to become the boss of a consumer business. He spent his childhood living with his father in Cheshire and visiting his mother in Swansea, south Wales, in the holidays, spawning a love of Welsh sport. The engineering graduate was later an intern at an iron ore mine in a remote Western Australia village, watching the process of “basically blowing up a mountain”, which triggered an interest in the environmental impact of industrial activity. He completed a master’s degree in pollution and environmental control and had roles in handling emissions at Powergen. “In technical roles, you’re only mitigating the impacts; the key question was strategically what can you actually do about it?” He then took on strategy jobs and, after E.ON’s takeover in 2002, ran its renewables businesses. Deals to sell off fossil fuel and renewables assets followed, while E.ON’s UK arm focused on consumers. Lewis became E.ON’s UK chief in 2017 and snapped up npower and its 2 million customers in 2019 after the supplier scrapped plans to merge with SSE. “It was very, very challenging. The business was very heavily loss-making, the service levels had declined and it had lost a huge number of customers. We did a fundamental transformation.” As a group, E.ON raked in profits of £3.47bn in the first half of this year, although that was £591m down on a year earlier. In the UK, there’s a host of projects under way, including a feasibility study on generating green hydrogen for Sheffield’s steel industry from a biomass plant, and Lewis is keen to replicate elements of the “ectogrid”, a city-scale energy sharing project in Sweden, on British shores . He’s also convinced a paradigm shift is occurring whereby consumers engage with energy and commit to using it more dynamically. “Our strategy is to get the right devices – smart meters, EV [electric vehicle] chargers, solar panels, batteries, heat pumps – in the right places: from homes to SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] to large customers and whole cities. He argues that the mix of gas, coal, nuclear and renewables has meant the UK has “smart flexible generation and inflexible customers who turned on their demand when they wanted and supply responded”. With more intermittent wind and solar “we need smart, flexible customers”. As such, E.ON was among the first suppliers to offer National Grid’s demand flexibility service, incentivising them to reduce their power. “Customers never felt the need to engage – now they’re really engaged,” he says. Asked about his plans when he gets home to Warwickshire that evening, Lewis says he intends to walk along the Grand Union canal to the pub near his home. With the state of the energy industry, he’ll have plenty more to discuss with friends over a pint."
"Meta, the Facebook owner, will pay out $725m (£600m) to plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit alleging privacy violations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the company has said in a court filing. The settlement will end a long-running dispute over the revelations that the political consultancy had accessed the data of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent, and used it to target political adverts. “This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case,” the lawyers leading the case, Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver, said. They added in a court filing that the settlement “would be the largest data privacy or data breach class action settlement ever achieved in the United States”, 10% higher again than the next largest – also awarded against Facebook, for signing up users to facial recognition services without their consent. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: “We pursued a settlement as it’s in the best interest of our community and shareholders. Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy programme. We look forward to continuing to build services people love and trust with privacy at the forefront.” The company did not admit to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which still needs to be approved by a judge. The case revolved around allegations that Facebook had broken state and federal laws by failing to prevent app developers harvesting user data on a widespread basis. Users were misled into believing that the company offered them control over their personal data, the lawsuit argued, when in fact “Facebook, despite its promises to restrict access, continued to allow a preferred list of app developers to access the information of users’ friends”. Facebook’s defence centred on the claim that users could not expect absolute privacy for information they had already posted on the site with the knowledge that it would be shown to their friends. As a result, the company argued, the users had suffered no “tangible” harm. That was rejected in 2019 by Judge Vince Chhabria, who said: “Facebook’s motion to dismiss is littered with assumptions about the degree to which social media users can reasonably expect their personal information and communications to remain private. Facebook’s view is so wrong. “Sharing information with your social media friends does not categorically eliminate your privacy interest in that information.” At the core of the case are the revelations around Cambridge Analytica, which harvested the data of tens of millions of Facebook users by partnering with a personality quiz operation and using the Facebook API to build extensive profiles on individuals’ behaviour and personalities. Facebook discovered the operation in 2015, but it was only revealed to the public in March 2018, when an Observer investigation uncovered the operation’s involvement in the US election."
"A state-backed review into female entrepreneurship is to be rebranded by the government as part of efforts to cut ties with the former NatWest chief executive Alison Rose, months after pushing her to resign over a scandal linked to Nigel Farage’s bank accounts. The “Rose review” is to be renamed after the banking executive was asked by the department for business and trade to leave the project, and the next stages for the initiative are expected to be announced within weeks, the Guardian can reveal. Rose was appointed by the Treasury in 2019 to lead the eponymous programme, which aims to identify barriers for female entrepreneurs and close the gap with their male counterparts. But the name change is the Tory government’s latest attempt to distance itself from Rose, who ministers put pressure on to quit this summer after NatWest Group’s row with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. The controversy started when Coutts – the NatWest-owned private bank for the ultra-wealthy – planned to shut Farage’s bank accounts, and snowballed after Farage obtained internal documents that showed the bank had concerns over his political views. The scandal escalated when it emerged that Rose had discussed Farage’s case with a BBC journalist. She has since been forced to forgo £7.6m in pay from NatWest, though independent lawyers hired by the bank concluded she had made an “an honest mistake” in speaking with the BBC and that concerns over Farage’s political views were not the driving factor in the decision to shut his accounts. The business department asked her to step down from the Rose review shortly after her resignation from NatWest, and effectively put the scheme on pause in the summer. A business department email, which was sent to the Rose review’s board members and seen by the Guardian, said a final decision on the scheme’s new name would be left to its next chair, who has yet to be appointed by the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch. “We have advised that consideration of a new brand to our work on women’s enterprise should wait for the new chair to be in post and should be taken in consultation with you all,” the email said. “Communications work using the Rose review brand will be paused for the time being, for example on LinkedIn and through the newsletter.” The business department said it would not be sharing its shortlist for chair candidates, even with board members, in order to “preserve [Badenoch’s] freedom of action”. The business department also plans to split the top position, and hire an additional “champion” or “ambassador” for women’s enterprise who would serve for one to two years, alongside the chair – who will probably come from a financial services company. Badenoch has not informed the review’s board members of a preferred candidate, and is understood to be facing the added challenge of finding someone whose business can foot the review’s bill – which had previously been covered by NatWest. Some board members were left with the impression that the future of the review was coming down to “cold hard cash”, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. The government has not yet made any public statement, but is expected to announce next steps in early January. Rose said in a statement that she was “incredibly proud of the Rose review and the great progress that has been made”, and urged the government to push forward with its work. “It is vital for the UK economy that the good work done to date by the Rose review is built upon and I hope the government and all those involved will continue to focus on supporting female entrepreneurs. It would be a huge, missed opportunity if they didn’t do so,” she said. Rose spent 27 years working her way up from a graduate trainee position to become NatWest’s first female chief executive in 2019. She has not taken another job since leaving the banking group. She noted that nearly 200 banks, venture capital businesses, private investors and financial services companies had become signatories of the review. “While clearly much still needs to be done to unlock the potential of female entrepreneurship – which represent a £250bn revenue opportunity for the country – we are seeing positive momentum.”"
"Lauren Danson Purvis was fresh out of college when she launched Mizuba Tea Co, her business that imports and sells fine matcha tea from Uji, Japan. A lifelong tea nerd, Purvis had befriended a tea farmer on a family trip to the region, which is near Kyoto and is the birthplace of matcha, a stone-milled jade-colored green tea used in Japanese tea ceremonies. Six months later, when the farmer she’d become friends with asked for help selling his tea in the US, Purvis decided to start a business. But she quickly realized how little she knew about business in general, let alone how to import tea, meet Food and Drug Administration regulations, and create sell sheets for retailers. “I never cried so much as I did that first year,” Purvis, 33, says. “The sheer learning curve was extremely overwhelming. I had no idea what this entailed, but I knew I loved matcha enough to want to see it happen.” Her father, a family doctor who ran a practice in the Santa Barbara area for 30 years, shared advice on hiring and setting up her business, and staked Mizuba with a small loan. Purvis repaid him the first year, and has been profitable ever since. Her mom came onboard – now known as “the matcha mom” in the region around the family home – and handles deliveries, receives shipments and watches inventory. Purvis’s father joined as the CFO, and is in charge of payroll and financial matters. Her husband, Dan, is a graphic designer who started out working on packaging. In 2018 he came onboard full-time as the COO and food safety manager – as well as the company’s janitor. As CEO, Purvis oversees purchasing, manages farmer relations, runs customer service, develops products and trains baristas around Portland, Oregon, where her company is based. She manages partnerships and marketing, collaborates on social campaigns, and plans events. Though she has a team of five others, Purvis touches every part of the business, including quality assurance and financials. “We all do what needs to be done,” she says. The one component they outsource is human resources. Demand for matcha started booming in 2015. That was when National Public Radio named it “superdrink” of the year, and wellness influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow began posting the Kermit-green tea on Instagram. Tea drinking in general got another boost during the pandemic. A 2021 study found that a green tea component lauded for brain health also helps ward off Covid infections. The international matcha market is expected to nearly double from $3bn in 2020 to $5.62bn by 2028, according to Verified Market Research. The word “matcha” means “rubbed tea” in Japanese, and there are specialized traditions around how it’s grown and made, especially around Uji. True matcha is made from Camellia sinensis leaves grown in shade so they retain a fresh green sweetness. While gourmet goods like champagne and prosciutto di Parma have an international body regulating their production, however, there is no such watchdog group in place for matcha. The tea market has been flooded with cheap and bitter “powdered green tea” from places as far flung as India and Australia. With her offerings from smooth daily matcha to specialty versions such as okumidori (a savory matcha), Purvis’s business has grown steadily, and now has more than 600 wholesale accounts and thousands of direct consumers, even with a lean staff and very little digital advertising. This year, Purvis celebrated a decade in business. The challenges keep mounting, though. Purvis still finds herself getting bogged down with managing her inbox, instead of big-picture tasks. “Entrepreneurs have to develop a tough skin,” she says. She has found people copying her trademark or even whole pages of her website. She’s also come across people using her logo on YouTube videos to sell their own matcha. Purvis is now adept at writing cease-and-desist letters. “It feels violating and a huge waste of time, but you have to deal with it,” she says. “The longer you do it, the more prepared you are. You get yourself a fabulous trademark lawyer.” There’s another challenge on the horizon: now that she and her husband are expecting their first child, Purvis is wondering how she can balance sustaining Mizuba’s slow-but-steady growth and impending motherhood. “I’m asking myself what do I want the next 10 years to look like?” she says. She doesn’t want to hustle so hard she burns out, and she isn’t interested in taking on investors or outright selling her company, like so many founders do after a decade, if not sooner. She’s even refused a few offers to wholesale her entire supply to a single national outlet. “Tea is so dynamic and it’s such an accessible luxury,” Purvis says. Her dream is to steer Mizuba into a long-term business that her children might take over someday – if they want to. “My son can do whatever he wants. He better appreciate tea, but I’m not going to expect him to take over our family dynasty or anything,” she says. She wonders what business resources she should invest in to help her maintain business growth and balance her work and home life. The Guardian spoke with three experts about her predicament. Suneel Gupta Founding CEO of the Rise nutrition coaching app and author of Everyday Dharma “The most important resource Purvis can invest in is her own energy,” Gupta says. “When entrepreneurs fizzle out, it’s very rare that they run out of time or talent. What they run out of is energy. Troubles arise when they don’t have enough gas in the tank to continue going after the vision they set out to see through.” Gupta recommends that a busy entrepreneur such as Purvis stay sharp by dividing each hour into a 55-minute work sprint followed by five minutes of rest. He calls this cycle “rhythmic renewal”. At first, the 45 minutes of rest in a nine-hour day may seem like a loss of productivity. “[But] those five minutes make the other 55 far more creative, collaborative and energetic,” Gupta says, adding that most high performers take eight mini-breaks a day. These five-minute breaks spent walking outside sans cellphone, playing Wordle, doing push-ups or chatting with a friend lets you end the day with as much energy as you had in the morning. Gupta says this practice allowed him to have energy and attention when he came home to his small children. “If you want to go far in a month, you have to hustle nonstop, but if you want to build something great over time and go far, there has to be a different way,” he says. “Rhythmic renewal carves that path for us.” Maria Uspenski Founder of the Tea Spot, an online retail and wholesale tea business based in Boulder, Colorado, and author of Cancer Hates Tea: A Unique Preventive and Transformative Lifestyle Change to Help Crush Cancer Many tea purveyors struggle to verify the purity and authenticity of tea supplied by overseas brokers, Uspenski says. So Purvis’s direct access to impeccable, farm-fresh matcha from Uji, Japan, gives her a huge advantage. Uspenski advises investing in brand marketing to highlight this difference. “I would focus, focus, focus 100% on marketing and differentiating myself that way. Americans need education and a foundation on why her okumidori matcha is better. I would try to own the premium matcha space. Purvis should develop storytelling around an aspect of her brand difference she wants to emphasize.” With more than 20 years in business, Uspenski has learned that a circumstance that initially looks like a disadvantage can be flipped into a strength. So while any ground-up green tea can be labeled matcha, and pretenders have flooded the market with bitter, bad-tasting product, Purvis can use that to her advantage. “It all ultimately comes down to taste,” Uspenski says. Once people who started drinking bulk matcha try Purvis’s brand, they’ll be delighted, and keep coming back. Asahi Pompey Global head of corporate engagement and president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation and leader of Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Small Businesses program Purvis should feel proud of building a thriving business from scratch, and she is doing so many things right, Pompey says. For the next phase of business and life, Purvis needs to start thinking – and functioning – like a leader rather than an employee. “She’s ready to transition from working in her business to working on her business,” Pompey says. She recommends investing in a strong person to handle operations. “That person can keep the business going, allowing you to think about strategy and really expand and grow beyond the day-to-day,” Pompey says. Many entrepreneurs believe they have to choose between family or business. “That’s a false dichotomy,” Pompey says. She suggests Purvis consider Goldman Sachs’s 10,000 Small Businesses program, a free in-person curriculum accepting applications from entrepreneurs in the US, Puerto Rico, France and the UK. The class teaches entrepreneurs about growth margins, wholesale pricing strategy and price elasticity, and brings them into community with others. Pompey also suggested that Purvis consider pruning her wholesale client list to the most profitable, and reflecting on whether her pricing conveys the quality of her matcha. “Customers see price as a signifier of quality,” Pompey says, adding that just 2% of the green tea market is organic. More educational marketing content will help consumers understand why Mizuba is worth a premium price. “People need to be able to differentiate between authentic and imitation,” Pompey says. “She should really make sure she’s bringing the customer along to understand green tea.” Purvis’s choice “They’re all great,” Purvis says. “In light of the next chapter of life, Asahi’s advice paired with Gupta’s will help me because becoming a mother is going to be a huge shift. I also love Maria’s tips because to some degree marketing is something I’m already doing but probably want to see it at a stronger level.” “I actually resonate most with Asahi’s suggestion about thinking and functioning more as a leader rather than an employee. I’m always struggling with getting lost in my to-do list rather than deep-focus projects. Hiring an operations manager is a smart idea. While I appreciate everyone’s insight and I am super thankful for them, I think Asahi’s advice would be the most dynamic. I also love the impetus to dig deeper into education, which is our No 1 pillar.”"
"Known for selling goods in bulk, Costco’s latest such offering – gold bars – has proved a hit, with $100m worth sold in the most recent quarter, Business Insider reported. With demand for the precious metal rising globally amid the economic uncertainty of the past few years, Costco in September began selling 1oz (28g) bars of 24-karat gold exclusively online, with Costco members eligible to buy two apiece. The retailer has more than 72m paid memberships. Each new release of gold bars usually sells out “within a few hours”, AP reported the Costco CFO, Richard Galanti, saying in a September company earnings call. The exact price of the gold is hard to track, as they are reserved for members only. But some media outlets have reported that the bars cost just under $2,000, slightly below the current market price of gold, which stands at $2,048.30. Despite being known for discount prices, Costco does sell a few other expensive items. In the last economic quarter it reportedly took $20,000 for an index card autographed by the baseball legend Babe Ruth. Galanti also joked that “last-minute shoppers” could still buy an autographed 1951 rookie card from Mickey Mantle for $250,000. Both the cards and the bars are non-refundable. • This article was amended on 18 December 2023 because an earlier version mistakenly said the cards and the bars were refundable."
"Vinyl records were a surprise hit this Christmas, with weekly sales in the UK soaring to their highest level this century during the festive shopping period, fuelled by artists including Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones. The vinyl record resurgence, with a new generation of music lovers turning to retro formats such as LPs and cassettes, has fuelled a sales surge to their highest annual level since Elton John’s Sacrifice and Vanilla Ice’s Ice Ice Baby topped the charts in 1990. Last week, more than 250,000 vinyl records were sold, the most since the turn of the century, as music lovers opted for the classic format as gifts for Christmas. Vinyl albums have become prized for their cover art, sleeve notes and warmer sound compared with digital streaming. The top sellers last week were Taylor Swift’s new version of 1989, Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, The Rolling Stones’ Hackney Diamonds, Pink Floyd and Abba Gold, as a growing army of Swifties boosted the US singer’s sales while older collectors turned to the classics to build out their collections. Overall, purchases of vinyl LPs have risen for a 16th consecutive year, topping 5.9m this year, an 11.7% annual increase, more than four times the rate seen in 2022. The most popular vinyl artist was Swift. In a year in which she conquered the movie box office, notching up the biggest concert film of all time with The Eras Tour, the singer continued to re-record earlier albums, allowing her to profit from her music after her original masters were sold away from her. Two new editions became bestsellers this year: 1989, and Speak Now from 2010. Other biggest-selling artists on vinyl this year were Blur, Lana Del Rey, Lewis Capaldi, The Rolling Stones and Kylie Minogue, according to data from Official Charts for the first 51 weeks of this year, analysed by the music trade body the BPI. While the once mighty CD continues its inexorable decline – sales have plummeted in the face of the streaming revolution, and the format has not proved a favourite with collectors – sales fell at the smallest rate in a decade this year. CD sales peaked in 2004 and began to decline in 2005, with digital streaming now accounting for more than 80% of the UK music market. This year CD sales are expected to fall by 6.6% to about 10.6m, a significant improvement on the 19.3% fall recorded last year. Sales of cassettes have topped 100,000 units for a fourth consecutive year. Overall, the market for physical formats – vinyl, CDs and cassettes – will decline by just 1% this year. This is the closest it has come to stabilising since 2004, the last year to show overall growth. “Led by vinyl, the resurgence of physical product underlines the resilience of the UK music market at a time when streaming consumption continues to hit record levels,” said Jo Twist, the chief executive of the BPI. “Whilst LP sales have now been on an upward path for the past 16 years, it is encouraging to see stabilisation in demand for CD, as well as new generations of music fans falling in love with the cassette. It is giving people more choice than ever in how they enjoy their favourite music.” In November, the industry was given a pre-Christmas confidence boost when HMV reopened its flagship store on London’s Oxford Street after a four-year absence, and the entertainment retailer’s owner hailed a revival in sales of physical music formats, including CDs. Bestselling vinyl albums in 2023 (up to chart week 51) 1. Taylor Swift – 1989 (Taylor’s Version) Swift continues to earn a great reception to the releases of her albums (in response to her masters being sold away from her), and her 2014 smash hit took this year’s vinyl top spot. 2. The Rolling Stones – Hackney Diamonds Released in October, this was the Stones’ first album of original material in 18 years and featured a stellar guest-star lineup, making it a guaranteed seller. 3. Lana Del Rey – Did You Know There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd The songwriter’s ninth album, released in March, was a huge success despite the singer eschewing commercial hits for more cryptic, exploratory material. 4. Taylor Swift – Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) Swift rereleased her 2010 album in the summer and it was an instant hit with fans, becoming her 10th UK No 1 album. 5. Fleetwood Mac – Rumours The classic 1977 album is a staple of most vinyl collections and appears in the top 10 bestsellers for an eight consecutive year. 6. Blur – The Ballad of Darren The ninth studio album from the beloved British rock band received rave reviews and features in the Guardian’s top 10 best albums of 2023. 7. Pink Floyd – The Dark Side of the Moon Like Rumours, the iconic album cover of this 1972 Pink Floyd classic can be found in many vinyl collections and it frequently bags a bestseller spot. 8. Taylor Swift – Midnights Although it has been more than a year since Swift released this surprise new album – her 10th – a number of special editions probably helped it to retain a top spot. 9. Olivia Rodrigo – Guts The second album from the Gen Z icon was also this year’s bestselling cassette tape, showing that new generations of music fans are fully embracing the physical formats decades after their heyday. 10. Lewis Capaldi – Broken by Desire to be Heavenly Sent The highly anticipated follow-up to Capaldi’s mammoth hit debut album was released in May and was an instant success with fans of his mournful ballads."
"The London Stock Exchange has ended the year trailing rival markets in Europe and the US, as a stagnating economy and a volatile political climate deterred investment and cast a shadow over the nation’s economic prospects. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies reached 7,733 points on Friday, the final trading day of the year. While a late rally helped the index to its highest closing level since late May, it has gained just under 4% since January, compared with a global average of 20%, as measured by the MSCI All Country World Index. As in previous years, the FTSE 100’s lack of technology companies left it floundering against Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 index has jumped by 25% this year to the brink of a record high. The Nasdaq Composite index has risen by 45% this year, lifted by a boom in big tech stocks such as the chipmaker Nvidia, whose shares have soared by 240% as the boom in artificial intelligence drove demand for its high-end semiconductors. Germany’s DAX index rallied by 20%, while France’s CAC gained 16.75% and Italy’s FTSE MIB surged almost 30%, as European markets recovered from losses in 2022. The pan-European Stoxx 600, which tracks the largest companies across European markets, gained more than 12%. Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, described the FTSE 100’s 3.8% rise this year as “paltry” when compared with its international peers. “Britain’s blue-chip index still appears unloved with attention grabbed by the bright lights of Wall Street and the tech-heavy makeup of New York’s exchanges, with a frenzy for all things AI fuelling buying behaviour,” Streeter said. “Even though the Brexit hangover has eased, the UK’s stagnating economy and volatile political scene of recent years appears to be putting off investors,” she added. The year started brightly for the FTSE 100. It broke through the 8,000 points mark for the first time, hitting a record high of 8,047 points in mid-February. But trading through the rest of the year was choppy, as concerns over the UK’s weak growth and rising interest rates weighed on stocks. The smaller FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies had a slightly better year, gaining about 4.5%. Rolls-Royce was the top riser on the FTSE 100 this year. The engineering company gained 220% as traders welcomed the turnaround plan being implemented by the new chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgiç. Rolls’s strength helped the UK’s aerospace and defence sector to rise by more than 67% in 2023, also aided by a 30% jump in shares in the weapons maker BAE Systems, while the aerospace manufacturer Melrose’s share price doubled this year. Marks &amp; Spencer, which was promoted back to the FTSE 100 this summer, gained 120% in 2023 as the recovery at its clothing division helped the company regain its crown as the UK’s biggest womenswear retailer. At the other end of the leaderboard, the mining company Anglo American fell by 39% this year, a dire performance that raised speculation it could become a takeover target. In December, Anglo cut its production outlook, after problems with iron ore and copper mining. Shares in the wealth manager St James’s Place lost 37%, in a year in which regulators pressed it to revamp its fee structure to reduce overall charges for existing investments. Not every international stock market rallied this year. China’s CSI 300 index fell by more than 11% in 2023, as weak economic growth, a liquidity crisis in the property sector and geopolitical tensions all weighed on shares. The pound has enjoyed its best year against the US dollar since 2017, gaining 5% as it climbed from $1.21 in January to $1.27 at the end of December. But that rally was partly down to the dollar’s weakness; the greenback lost about 2% against a basket of currencies. Traders anticipate several cuts to US interest rates in 2024, as the Federal Reserve tries to achieve a “soft landing” – lowering inflation without causing a recession."
"The cost of living crisis has made it a struggle for many to put food on the table at Christmas, but for US tech billionaires and Russian oligarchs alike, the festive period is all gravy. From Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg at the top of the tree to relative small fry such as Britain’s James Dyson and Jim Ratcliffe, Manchester United’s newest shareholder, the world’s wealthiest mostly got richer in 2023, figures show. Even a coterie of Russian oligarchs have managed to keep growing their fortunes, at least on paper, shrugging off the impact of economic sanctions imposed on them in multiple jurisdictions in response to the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Of the world’s 50 richest people, 12 lost money in 2023 while the remainder watched their piles grow, albeit without adjusting for inflation. Of the top 500, 77% grew richer, some by almost unimaginable sums. Musk tops the table with an estimated net worth of $235bn, according to daily data tracking the fortunes of the world’s top 500 billionaires, compiled by Bloomberg. Despite reports that his stake in X, formerly known as Twitter, plunged by more than half after he paid $44bn for it in 2022, the South African-born billionaire’s bread-and-butter business, Tesla, came to the rescue. Shares in the electric car company have more than doubled this year, giving it a notional market value of nearly $816bn and helping Musk, Tesla’s biggest shareholder, increase his overall wealth by nearly $98bn. That increase is more than the annual GDP of Angola. Musk’s wealth increased by the most outright, despite his forthright suggestion that uneasy advertisers on X should “go fuck yourself” – but he did not make the largest gains in percentage terms. One of the biggest winners on that score was his rival Mark Zuckerberg, whom he was due to fight in a cage match earlier this year before the pair thought better of it. The Facebook founder’s fortune leapt by 184%, from $45bn to $128bn, as the value of the social network’s parent company, Meta, soared by 172% over the year. After a terrible 2022 in which Meta’s value collapsed following shareholder concerns that it was spending too much on a drive into the so-called metaverse and ignoring its key businesses WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, the stock has recovered almost all its losses. But Zuckerberg’s 2023 gains weren’t the paciest in the top 50 either. The Indonesian conglomerate owner Prajogo Pangestu enjoyed a roughly sevenfold increase in his wealth, thanks to a big bet on geothermal energy, catapulting him into the top 50 global billionaires with a count of $31.5bn. There were some notable losers. While all of the top 14 increased their wealth, number 15 – the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani – saw his fortune fall by $36bn, to $84.3bn. The value of the Adani family companies collapsed after an activist investor accused Gautam of “pulling the largest con in corporate history”. Adani Group denied the allegations. The list of billionaires is dominated by American men. Of the top 10 wealthiest people, France’s Bernard Arnault is the only representative from the rest of the world, with a $179bn fortune that grew by $17.2bn thanks to the performance of his LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury group. France also provides the highest-ranking woman on the list, the businesswoman and L’Oréal beauty empire heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, who comes in at 12th place after a $316m increase that took her net worth to $99.1bn. Many of the Russians hit with sanctions in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine have only grown richer, raising questions over the impact of measures intended by the US, UK and EU to restrict their financial freedom. Sanctioned individuals whose wealth has increased include the nickel tycoon Vladimir Potanin, up nearly $2bn to $30.6bn; the metals to telecoms magnate Alisher Usmanov, $1.88bn higher at $20.3bn; and the industrialist Alexei Mordashov, up $1.3bn to $20bn. Financial restrictions mean some of their assets remain illiquid: Mordashov’s stake in the German tour operator Tui is frozen under the sanctions regime, meaning his shares cannot be sold and he cannot collect dividends. Britain provided 17 of the top 500 billionaires, compared with 189 from the US and 52 from China. Dyson was the richest Briton, in 95th place globally with a fortune of $19.9bn after a $5bn rise. Not far behind, in 97th, was Ratcliffe, the Monaco-based petrochemicals tycoon who increased his wealth by $8.55bn, to $19.4bn. That figure now includes a £1bn stake in Manchester United, after he bought 25% of the club in a deal that completed this week."
"In the old days, there were the FAANGs, the five big US tech stocks that dominated the investment landscape – Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet). That picture is now out of date. Say hello instead to what is variously called the Super Seven or the Magnificent Seven – four of the above (the dropout being Netflix) plus Microsoft, Tesla and the chip-maker Nvidia. This group’s domination is the stock market story of 2023. The chart below is “one for the ages”, says Duncan Lamont, the head of strategic research at the fund manager Schroders. It shows how, even if you invest via one of the broadest and most widely used “global” stock market indices, you will end up with a portfolio that is very American and very skewed towards US tech. The index is the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), which covers approximately 85% of “the global investable equity opportunity”, as the compilers put it, by measuring almost 3,000 large and mid-sized companies in 23 developed markets and 24 emerging ones. The bigger a company becomes in value, the greater its weighting in the index. The seven are now so big that they account for 17.2% of the whole thing, while the combined representatives of Japan, the UK, China, France and Canada contribute 17.3%. Seven US companies equals five countries. “This is far from diversified exposure,” says Lamont. Apple alone, with a market value of $3tn, is bigger than the entire UK stock market. The numbers have become so astonishing, in part, because of what is shown in the second chart. Up to last week, the group of seven has risen in value by 74% in 2023. The rest of the world’s equities, within the same ACWI index, have managed 12%. If your portfolio did not include the Magnificent Seven in 2023, it was hard to keep up. Is this degree of concentration healthy? It’s certainly unprecedented. Thanks to the whoosh from the seven during 2023, US stocks now account for 63% of the supposedly global ACWI. Even in the go-go days of the Japanese economic miracle, the country accounted for only 44% of the same index. “The US has far exceeded the level of concentration of Japan in the 1980s, which everyone thought was extreme at the time,” says Lamont. Yet it would be hard to argue that the rise of the seven has been fuelled by the type of wild speculation that created the turn-of-the-century dotcom bubble. The 240% rise in Nvidia’s stock price this year may or may not be overdone, but it’s undeniable that the company’s order book for computer chips is booming as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution arrives. It would also be wrong to think of the seven as entirely alike. All have leading positions in growing markets and Amazon, Google and Microsoft have big cloud services divisions. But Amazon’s retail division has little in common with Google’s search business and Microsoft’s core software business is different again. All may benefit from AI, which helps to explain the stock market’s renewed love affair with technology in 2023 after a heavy “down” year in 2022, but the degrees will differ. Tesla remains, primarily, a maker of electric vehicles. Instead, it’s probably more sensible just to think through the implications of such extreme market concentration. In a broadly exposed investment portfolio a lot of risk – in both directions – is driven by just seven stocks. Lamont makes a couple of points. First, the statistically correct observation that the US stock market is now priced at nose-bleed levels, historically speaking, isn’t telling the full story. Rather, it’s reflecting the influence of the seven. “US exceptionalism is not all stocks,” he says. “It is a small number crushing everything in the path.” The average US stock is not expensive by traditional investment yardsticks. Second, there is scope for disappointment when stocks are priced for perfection. The Schroders research found that periods of high concentration in markets have tended to be followed by periods of poorer performance by the bigger stocks. “This time may be different, and we are in uncharted territory to an extent,” concedes Lamont. You could say it suits Schroders, as an active management house, to suggest the pendulum is about to swing away from passive index-followers. But the basic point feels intuitively correct: the current concentration is extraordinary, out of whack with historical norms and the relative lack of diversification is possibly underappreciated by investors. Timing is always a mug’s game – but a reversal looks the way to bet."
"The UK installed a record number of public electric car chargers in 2023 as the size of network of ultra-rapid chargers for longer journeys doubled. Almost 16,000 public chargers were installed in the year to 12 December, pushing the total above 53,200, according to the data company ZapMap. That represented a 43% increase on 2022, significantly faster than the last three years. Increasing the number of public chargers is one of the key challenges facing every country in the world in the switch from polluting petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles. The increase in UK chargers during 2023 has almost certainly outstripped the growth of electric car sales, which were up by 28% in the year to November compared with the previous 12 months. Nevertheless, the number of chargers will need to continue its rapid rate of increase in the coming years, as rules known as the zero emissions vehicles (Zev) mandate force carmakers to sell rapidly increasing numbers of electric cars. The rules suggest 80% of UK car sales will be electric by 2030, despite Rishi Sunak’s decision in September to delay the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 until 2035. The continued rise in charger numbers will be vital to reduce “range anxiety” – the fear that drivers will not be able to find one to top up their battery. Melanie Shufflebotham, the co-founder and chief operating officer of Zapmap, said growth in the number of faster chargers would help to reduce range anxiety. The number of the fastest “ultra-rapid” chargers doubled during 2023 to more than 4,600. “There are now more than 10,000 rapid/ultra-rapid devices at 5,000 locations across the UK to support charging on longer journeys,” said Shufflebotham. “These can be found not just in motorway service areas or fuel forecourts but in many different types of locations, such as retail car parks and farm shops.” Andy Palmer, the chief executive of the EV charger provider Pod Point and a former boss of Aston Martin, said range anxiety was slowing the transition from petrol and diesel to electric, as it made some buyers hesitate before switching to a battery car. However, Palmer, who also led the introduction of the Leaf electric car as Nissan’s No 2 executive, said the anxiety could be addressed by more chargers and that at 200 miles or greater, the ranges of cars being built today were big enough for most people. “Practically, range anxiety is more of a perception problem, solved by a proliferation of public charging points, rather than an actual problem,” he said. “It’s important that charging infrastructure is able to counter that perception so that motorists can see the charging points in place and put their minds at ease.” Palmer added that the key was ensuring people were “given peace of mind to carry out longer journeys”. Ultra-rapid chargers are generally found near motorways and main roads to help people on longer journeys. However, the number of slow chargers being installed will also be crucial. Because of the lower power requirements, slow chargers are particularly attractive for people in towns and cities who do not have off-street parking to charge cheaply overnight. Last year, the government under Boris Johnson announced a target of 300,000 publicly available chargers by 2030. If sustained, a 43% growth rate would easily hit that target, although in practice it would become steadily harder to install more as the best locations were taken. Companies hoping to install more of ultra-rapid chargers on main routes are also concerned that the rate of installation will diminish because of the slow pace of upgrades to the UK’s electricity grid. There are also still large gaps in the charger network. Northern Ireland had only 23 chargers per 100,000 people in October, compared with 42 per 100,000 in north-west England, the next worst region. London has 193 public chargers per 100,000, by far the best provision in the UK, although its need is also high because of the large number of car owners without off-street parking."
"Telecoms providers have been forced to pause plans to impose digital phone lines on vulnerable customers after reports of pensioners left unable to call for help during power cuts. Companies including BT and Virgin Media have been forced by Michelle Donelan, the technology secretary, to sign a charter to safeguard at-risk households during the nationwide switchover from analogue to internet-based landlines. Digital phones are not compatible with some “telecare” panic buttons and don’t function during power outages. However, critics have condemned the action as too little and too late and urged the government to delay the switch-off of analogue services planned for December 2024. Last month, the Guardian reported on concerns that the digitalisation of the telecoms network was moving too fast and too soon and could leave vulnerable users cut off. John Whittingdale, the minister for digital infrastructure, last week informed parliament of “serious incidents” of telecare devices failing in emergencies. Telecoms companies, including BT and Virgin Media, were summoned to a meeting with government officials following the reports. They have since pledged not to switch households to digital phone lines without ensuring their medical devices will continue to work. Donelan said: “The recent issues families have had to endure are unacceptable, and today’s agreements will help to protect consumers in future.” However, campaigners claim that vulnerable households will continue to be put at risk unless the analogue switch-off is delayed. “It seems the whole project is being completely botched,” said Dennis Reed, the director of the campaign group Silver Voices, which accuses BT of reneging on earlier promises not to force over-70s to switch. “BT paused the rollout in 2022 after customers were unable to call 999 during storms, then resumed last year even though nothing had changed. I’m sceptical that telecoms firms will do as they say. We want the government to extend the rollout deadline by at least five years so all these problems can be ironed out.” BT has already moved 2 million of its 10 million landline customers on to the digital network and said the switchover was increasingly urgent as analogue technology aged. “It’s critically important that we manage customer migrations from old to new as quickly and smoothly as possible, while making the necessary provisions for those customers with additional needs, including telecare,” a spokesperson said. “The charter of commitments will help significantly in achieving these objectives.” A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “In line with the agreed commitments, we have paused switchovers as we review our processes to further support consumers, building on the range of measures that we already have in place.”"
"When the government announced this year it would indefinitely delay plans to force UK companies to adopt a new post-Brexit quality mark, the UKCA, Simon Blackham, of the insulation maker Recticel, was delighted. “Yes! An outbreak of common sense,” he recalls thinking. His joy was short-lived, however. It quickly emerged that the government’s change of heart did not apply to construction products, such as the insulation panels Recticel manufactures in Stoke-on-Trent. Within the next 18 months, the Belgian-owned firm expects to have to spend about £400,000 in the UK retesting its products to comply with the new regime. It is an increasingly common story: three years on from Brexit, as the government celebrates leaving the EU’s complex regulatory regime, many firms are finding the practicalities of this “divergence” costly and confusing – and business groups say that it is going to get worse. Chemicals are another case in point. Since January 2020, the UK has failed to ban 36 pesticides that are not allowed for use in the EU. Blackham wearily explains that construction products are overseen by Michael Gove’s housing ministry, not the Business and Trade department which issued that statement back in August, saying the government would continue to recognise the EU’s CE mark for many products. Gove’s department has opted instead to press ahead with replacing the CE mark with the UKCA, for all construction products sold in the UK from June 2025. This new mark incorporates the same standards as the EU version – but only UK-accredited testing facilities will be able to validate it. Blackham, Recticel’s senior technical manager in the UK, explains that means everything will need to be retested, by a UK-based lab. In Recticel’s case, he says, this would have to be done for eight products, at a cost of approximately £35,000 each. The firm will also have to repeat fire testing, at about £14,000 a product. “It’s the same standards, to the same test method, the same everything – and it would have to be paid for, ultimately by the customer, for us to retest material to a test that we already have, to a standard we’ve already done it to,” he says. The firm has not yet made the final decision to go ahead, in the hope that, as in so many areas relating to post-Brexit regulation, the government – or its successor – could change its mind. “Where we are at the moment is that we’re still waiting, still hoping that there is a chink of common sense on the horizon,” he says. But with testing capacity in the UK limited, they will to have to take the plunge soon. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities confirmed that the intention was not to recognise the CE mark from June 2025, but added, “we are reforming the UK’s construction product regime, and we recognise the need to provide certainty for the sector. We are carefully considering the recommendations put forward by independent reviewers and will set out next steps in due course.” Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, says the challenges faced by Recticel are being replicated at many other firms. “The unintended consequences are significant and incredibly damaging,” he says. “Most of the companies in my sector are European-owned, and they don’t want to produce a product to a different standard than the one they do in mainland Europe.” He adds that there are concerns about whether there is testing capacity in the UK to underpin the new regime. “I understand that there are some products that there is no test in the UK for – therefore in theory they will not be eligible to be placed on the UK market. That is the seriousness of it.” In one sense, the experience of the construction products industry is an exception. The decision to stick with CE marking for most sectors fitted a broader push by Rishi Sunak’s government to quietly smooth over trade frictions with the EU – by negotiating the Windsor Framework governing trade with Northern Ireland, and rejoining the Horizon scientific community, for example. Plans to impose border checks on goods coming into the UK have been repeatedly delayed – though are now due to come into force next month. “Active divergence has more or less stopped,” says Joël Reland, who tracks regulatory changes at the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe. He says the cost of living crisis has meant bashing Brussels is no longer seen as good politics. “What voters care about is the economy and inflation, and if you want to boost growth and control inflation, you don’t want to be pursuing much divergence because it’s disruptive to business and it potentially damages your trade.” “We’re getting more aligned in some areas,” agrees Stephen Phipson, chief executive of the manufacturers’ group Make UK, citing the decision to rejoin the European scientific funding scheme Horizon, and the 2035 date for phasing out petrol cars, which is now the same as in the EU, after Sunak pushed it back. However, many goods exporters have already faced a battery of new tests and requirements since the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) with the EU came into force in May 2021; and the challenge is likely to continue, as EU regulations shift over time – what Reland and his colleagues call “passive divergence”. Peter Kersh has just retired as managing director of the Yorkshire-based fish food maker WorldFeeds, which supplies aquariums and fish farms in more than 40 countries. After the TCA rewrote the rules of trade with Europe, it took the firm a year before it could find a way of dealing with the checks and paperwork necessary for every shipment. Previously, they would send small consignments via “groupage,” where a logistics firm would take a mixed shipment across to the continent made up of products from many different firms. Carriers stopped offering the service, once every crate from the UK had to be separately checked and accounted for. “When you ship food into the EU now you have to produce a health certificate, which is a laborious matter, and you have to have a vet inspection of your products on-site before they’re shipped across. So there’s all this rigmarole to go through, and it’s costly,” Kersh says. WorldFeeds ultimately found a solution – sending a full load to a single EU client, who then ships individual orders on to other customers. “So we’ve managed to kind of get our marketplace back. But it took a year to sort out and it’s added 30% to the cost of the product,” Kersh says. “Our customers have been very loyal to us: it’s a very special brand, it’s the best fish food in the world and people like it. But of course you can only stretch a piece of elastic so far, and they won’t wait because they’ve got to feed their fish. So we’ve been massively prejudiced by this. And it’s just really sad.” And like many respondents to the British Chamber of Commerce’s annual survey on the TCA earlier this month, he says that the gap between UK and EU regulation is likely to widen, as the EU’s rules shift and the UK struggles to keep up, even if it wants to. “Food is hugely regulated. It gets into ingredients that you can and can’t use: so they could ban an ingredient in the EU that we’re still using in the UK, which means you’re going to have two separate products now, because you can’t sell the same one.” Perhaps because of barriers such as these, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has suggested goods trade has been hit harder by Brexit than services exports, which have performed in line with other G7 countries. Labour has promised to align the UK more closely with EU rules – seeking new agreements on veterinary standards, for example, and mutual recognition of professional standards. But such changes appear unlikely to tackle the broader issue of the EU’s regulatory system drifting further away from the UK’s, as rules are updated over time. “We are starting to get out of step,” says Phipson. “We don’t have the regulatory capacity to keep up: it’s not intentional but we’re lagging behind.”"
"The new boss of the Body Shop has told staff the struggling ethical beauty retailer is “back for good” after it booked a profit in its first 100 days under new ownership. The retailer was bought out of administration in September by a consortium led by the British cosmetics tycoon Mike Jatania. The company sank into administration in February leading to the closure of 85 UK outlets but is understood to have reported a £2m profit on £28m of sales in the first three months under its new owners, led by Jatania’s Aurea Group. The retailer is now operating 113 stores in the UK, where it employs more than 1,200 people including at its headquarters, which will be moved to a new building in Brighton next month. Its head office staff were previously split between offices in London and Littlehampton, West Sussex, its long-term base set up by late founder Anita Roddick. In his final note to staff before Christmas, seen by the Guardian, new chief executive, Charles Denton, said: “I am so thrilled at how we are ending the year. Storm Darragh may have tried its worst, but we weathered it and some.” Denton, the former Molton Brown chief executive, said the chain had ended last week 17% ahead above internal sales forecasts, adding “throw whatever you like at us, and we’ll come bouncing back … back for good and last month … back in profit baby!”. The Body Shop, which made a £71m loss in year to December 2022, collapsed into administration in the UK less than three months after it was taken over by German private equity company Aurelius for £207m. It owed creditors more than £276m at the time. Administrators from FRP Advisory handled the UK shop closures, with the loss of about 800 jobs, before the business was bought by Aurea. Operations in the US, Germany and Belgium were also shut down after those businesses were either sold off or deprived of cash by the administration of the UK parent. The company, which once had 3,000 shops worldwide, continues to operate in 83 overseas markets with more than 1,300 outlets. Most of those stores are operated by franchise partners, including about 700 in Europe, 60 in Canada and nearly 100 in Australia as well as India, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea. One source familiar with The Body Shop’s operations cautioned against reading too much into its return to profit, noting that the company was now a smaller operation and that revenues could have been boosted by clearing stock and offering significant discounts. “The question is, how do they keep interest and innovation going?” the source said. The company, founded by Roddick in 1976, remained under family ownership for three decades until it was sold to the French cosmetics corporation L’Oréal, the owner of Maybelline and Garnier, for £652m in 2006. As The Body Shop’s sales and profits flagged, L’Oréal sold it on to Brazil’s Natura in 2017, but Natura was forced to sell up in 2023 to clear heavy debts built up by the acquisition of the beauty business Avon."
"The City regulator has given lenders a year to respond to the rising number of customer complaints over the way they were sold car loans, after a high court ruling left firms fearing a potential £30bn compensation bill. The Financial Conduct Authority said firms had until at least 4 December 2025 to provide a final response to agreements not involving a discretionary commission arrangement (DCA), in line with a deadline that had already been provided for complaints involving DCAs. DCAs allowed brokers to adjust the interest rates on motor finance, while non-DCAs do not. A court of appeal ruling in October said it was unlawful for two lenders to have paid a “secret” commission to car dealers without first telling the customer about the commission and getting their informed consent to the payment. Some lenders have since been flooded with complaints, including from claims management companies and claims law firms. Motor finance companies are likely to receive a high volume of complaints after the judgment, the FCA said. The watchdog had previously suggested the deadline could be set at the end of May or early December, and has opted for the latter. It said it extended the time companies had to handle complaints to “help prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and firms”. Last week, the supreme court granted permission for two car lenders, Close Brothers and the MotoNovo owner, FirstRand, to appeal against the court of appeal ruling in October. The FCA said on Thursday it planned to formally intervene in the case to share its expertise with the supreme court. The watchdog stressed that while the supreme court heard the appeal, firms must still comply with the law as it stood when arranging new motor finance agreements. The supreme court has not yet set a date for the hearing, but said it would take place by the end of the next legal term, 16 April 2025. That could lead to a decision by summer or autumn next year. The FCA’s top lawyer, Stephen Braviner Roman, said recently that the motor finance mis-selling scandal could ultimately be as big as the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling saga, which cost UK banks £50bn. More than 2 million people take out car finance loans every year. The deadline extension will cover motor leasing as well as motor finance credit agreements. The court of appeal’s judgment did not involve motor leasing. “However, consumers also use leasing to access motor vehicles, and it is important that consumers using similar products for similar purposes are treated in the same way,” the FCA said. Consumers have until 29 July 2026 or 15 months from the date of their final response letter from the firm, whichever is later, to refer a non-DCA complaint to the financial ombudsman, instead of the usual six months. The watchdog launched a review into historical motor finance DCAs in January to examine whether there was widespread misconduct before they were banned in 2021, whether consumers have lost out and, if so, the best way to ensure they receive compensation."
"Business figures have been sounding increasingly alarmed about the state of the UK’s jobs market in recent days, with the recruiter James Reed claiming it augurs a recession. There were certainly some signs of a slowdown in the latest labour market data, published on Tuesday – but with pay growing briskly, it was hard to detect a significant shift. Average regular pay increased at a healthy 5.2% clip in the three months to October, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) – up from 4.4% in the previous three-month period. Including bonuses, the figure was also 5.2%. That means real wages – adjusted for CPI inflation, the measure targeted by the Bank of England – also rose, by 3%, putting more money in the public’s pockets in the run-up to Christmas. The strongest annual pay growth was in manufacturing, the ONS said, at 6% – perhaps a sign that skilled workers in this key sector are in particular demand. If there were any lingering hope that the Bank’s monetary policy committee might deliver a pre-Christmas interest rate cut on Thursday, when they meet for the last time in 2024, the pay data must have extinguished it. They will fret that such strong wage growth will put a floor under prices, with inflation already expected to continue ticking up in the coming months. Reed’s downbeat analysis was more borne out in the data on jobs vacancies, which continued to decline, falling by another 3.7%, to 818,000. Since peaking in spring 2022, as the economy surged back from the pandemic, vacancies – which can be a pointer of the jobs market’s future direction – have now fallen by a total of 486,000. But there was little drama in the rest of Tuesday’s data. Unemployment was up, by a modest 31,000 on the quarter; but employment also rose, by 173,000 – though much of that growth was in health and social care. Despite Friday’s unexpected news that GDP shrank slightly, by 0.1%, in October, there is little in the labour market data to indicate that a recession – even a shallow one – is on the way. Absent some fresh shock, strong real wage growth should help to ease the burden of the cost of living crisis for households, and boost consumer confidence as the year comes to a close. But this data is the last set gathered before Rachel Reeves delivered her late October budget, the centrepiece of which was the £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs). It is that policy in particular that has infuriated some business groups and led to predictions of layoffs. Even if these dire warnings prove correct, they would not yet be evident in official figures – and indeed, the NICs rise does not come into force until April, giving businesses some leeway to make decisions. It will be some time before policymakers can judge how the chancellor’s budget package – and other factors, such as the significant increase in the minimum wage – filter out into the labour market. For now, the strongest signal the MPC is likely to take from Tuesday’s dump of data is that bumper pay rises may mean inflation is harder to drive down than they hoped."
"A year after the murder of George Floyd, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart had a warning for corporate America. The death of Floyd triggered a wave of protest over systemic racism and was “not an isolated event. We have a long history of racism, and we see unacceptable events continue.” Walmart and other large US corporations made pledges to address inequities within their business, ones many feared would be dropped once the focus on Floyd’s killing and its aftermath faded. “We can’t let that be the case,” he wrote, outlining how the company was releasing its “diversity metrics twice a year” and calling on companies to “continue to address systemic racism and the structural inequities that are rooted in this nation’s history of slavery and that persist today”. Times have changed. Last month Walmart became the latest corporation to cave to a rightwing campaign against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, announcing it would stop using the term DEI altogether, drop DEI trainings, no longer consider race and gender as a means to improve diversity when making offers to suppliers and would not renew a racial equity center committed to addressing “the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people”. For TaNeka Hightower the news was like a “slap in the face”. A Walmart employee for about seven years in Memphis, Tennessee, Hightower said: “I identify with all of the groups pretty much covered up under the DEI. I question, do I still want to work at Walmart because they don’t acknowledge the safety concerns. They don’t acknowledge, the livable wage concerns, and then now I’m being slapped in the face because the groups that I identify with are being told you are no longer protected by us.” Walmart’s decision was celebrated by the conservative activist Robby Starbuck who has campaigned against similar initiatives at Ford, Harley-Davidson, Lowe’s and others. However, it appears the company’s plans to roll back its DEI policies were in the works before Starbuck’s intervention. Hightower said she found the reversal “very disturbing”. She said there was no communication provided to workers about the changes, rather she found out about the rollbacks via the news. “This just further confirms that we’re no longer a part of the family. We never really were. We were invited to the table to assist, helping the table get prepared, but we weren’t actually supposed to eat from said table,” she said. The union-backed Walmart workers group United for Respect has tried to introduce a shareholder proposal at Walmart’s past two annual shareholder meetings for a third-party independent racial equity audit of the corporation. The racial equity shareholder proposal has come up short of the 20% support it would need for Walmart to discuss it, receiving 18% in 2023 and just over 15% in 2024. Hightower said she planned on reintroducing it at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting in Arkansas. The multibillionaire Walton family hold about 46% of Walmart’s shares and about 35% of the company’s shares are held by investment groups, banks, and other institutions including BlackRock. The shareholder proposal received 42% support from shareholders not part of the Walton family in 2023. Hightower said she had been pushing for the audit “to see the disparities of how people of color are selected for those upper roles, how there’s a difference in the pay, how there’s a difference in the workload expectations based on race, color and gender”. Bianca Agustin, co-executive director at United for Respect said the DEI rollback policies came as a surprise to shareholders at Walmart and were concerning given Walmart is the largest private employer in the US overall and for Black Americans and women. “Given Walmart’s sheer size as the largest employer in the world, and the demographics of both their domestic workforce and their suppliers it was just very disappointing,” Agustin said. “This is just a huge regression I think in response to the Trump administration.” Agustin said in Walmart’s opposition to the racial equity shareholder proposal, they cited many of the DEI policies that the company has just rolled back, and claimed the company does internal racial equity audits but has never released the results of those audits. “We’re expecting a number of co-filers on this. I think a lot of investors were surprised, shocked and disappointed to see Walmart walk this back,” Agustin said. “Walmart has a real responsibility, given its scale, to track this, disclose this, and live up to the mission that they intended when they started the racial equity center, which was to address the root causes of inequality. This is just such a slap in the face, I think to the employees and to stakeholders that care.” Walmart did not comment on the shareholder proposal or criticisms on the DEI policy rollbacks. A spokesperson said in a statement: “Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.”"
"Many exporters are still struggling with post-Brexit trading rules, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has said, as it urges the government to press ahead with an EU “reset” in the new year. In a survey of more than 1,000 of its member companies, the BCC found just 15% said the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) with the EU, signed by Boris Johnson on Christmas Eve 2020, had helped them to grow sales with the EU. That compared with 40% of companies that said the deal had not helped them to increase sales with the bloc. Asked what they would like to see change, the most popular answer was for it to be made easier for British businesses to send UK staff to work in the EU – an option favoured by 46% of respondents. Shevaun Haviland, the BCC’s director general, suggested a closer EU relationship that tackled some trade barriers could help to offset the impact of the higher taxes imposed at Rachel Reeves’s budget in October. “The government has talked a lot about a new era of trade relations with the EU. But firms are grappling with increasing costs off the back of the autumn budget and this change cannot come soon enough,” she said. Haviland also urged ministers to negotiate a youth mobility deal that could allow EU workers to come to the UK and vice versa – a key demand of EU countries, but something the government has so far rejected outright. “Our businesses are clear on what they want to see, less paperwork and bureaucracy, greater flexibility on business travel and a balanced youth mobility scheme between the UK and EU,” she said. Other aspects of the Brexit deal that businesses said they would like to see improved included VAT requirements (36%) and mutual recognition of professional qualifications (24%). The government is hoping to negotiate a deal to allow professionals such as architects, doctors and accountants who qualify in the UK to practise across the EU. The BCC also pointed to the risk that trade frictions could increase further, if rules set in Brussels continue to evolve and Britain does not follow suit. The survey found that more than three-quarters of businesses, 77%, had no awareness of new EU regulations on safety and security that would affect exports to the 27-member bloc from January. Research published recently by researchers at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics found that in the first two years of operation, the TCA reduced trade by £27bn – less than half the hit forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. A government spokesperson said: “We are resetting the relationship with our European friends to strengthen ties, secure a broad-based security pact and tackle barriers to trade … We have been clear that there will be no return to the customs union, single market or freedom of movement.”"
"Royal Mail has been fined more than £10m by the postal regulator for missing its delivery targets, with more than a quarter of first-class mail arriving late. Ofcom, which fined the company £5.6m for the same failure of its regulatory obligations last November, said Royal Mail took “insufficient and ineffective steps” to improve its performance this year. Under the regulator’s rules, Royal Mail must deliver 93% of first-class mail within one working day of collection, and 98.5% of second-class mail within three working days of collection. Ofcom’s investigation found that in the year to the end of March the company delivered only 74.7% of first-class mail on time, and 92.7% of second-class mail within the regulatory time period. The company blamed its poor performance on its “challenging financial position”, and delays to the ballot on a deal that followed last year’s industrial action. “We do not consider either of these to be justifiable reasons for Royal Mail’s failure to provide the levels of service expected of it,” said Ofcom. “Ultimately, it is for the company to manage its financial position taking account of its obligations. Royal Mail took insufficient and ineffective steps to try and prevent this failure, which is likely to have impacted millions of customers who did not get the service they paid for.” Ofcom said Royal Mail’s performance was only “marginally better” this year and that it needed to do “much better”. The deterioration in delivery times will put further pressure on the company’s bosses just as a takeover deal is near to being finalised. Ofcom said that the £10.5m penalty, which is ultimately paid to the Treasury, could have been £15m but it was reduced because of Royal Mail’s “admissions of liability and agreement to settle the case”. “With millions of letters arriving late, far too many people aren’t getting what they pay for when they buy a stamp,” said Ian Strawthorner, the director of enforcement at Ofcom. “Royal Mail’s poor service is now eroding public trust in one of the UK’s oldest institutions. We’re seeing some signs of progress, but it must go further and faster to deliver the service that people expect.” A spokesperson for Royal Mail said the company had continued to “implement substantial changes to drive improvements” in mail delivery this year. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said the poor performance was a “direct result of the deliberate, sustained dismantling of UK postal services by a failed board and senior management team”. Royal Mail continues to vigorously lobby Ofcom to let it reduce deliveries of second-class letters to two or three days a week, cutting nearly 1,000 jobs and saving £300m a year in the process. It proposed paring back the daily Monday-to-Saturday second-class service to “every other weekday”, as letter delivery volumes plummet in the digital age. “Delivering great quality of service is extremely important to us and we are making the necessary changes to deliver for our customers,” said the spokesperson. “However, it is essential that these efforts are backed by urgent reform of the universal service, restoring it to a level that meets the needs of today’s postal users, not the needs of customers 20 years ago.” In September, Ofcom said it would “assess” whether certain changes to second-class letter delivery would meet postal users’ needs, before a formal consultation due early next year. The CWU said its members would not agree to any service changes until there were significant improvements at the company. “We need to be very clear – there will be no agreement to these changes from the CWU unless we see quality restored and the terms and conditions of our members improved,” said the union’s spokesman. Last month, the parent company of Royal Mail said it was considering job cuts and price rises on stamps and parcels as it blamed the Labour government’s first budget in 14 years for adding £120m to its costs. The fine comes as the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský’s takeover bid for Royal Mail is reportedly close to being finalised. The £3.57bn takeover by Royal Mail’s largest shareholder, Křetínský’s EP Group, was agreed by parent company IDS in May. However, the sale of the formerly state-owned service by a foreign buyer is being examined by the government under the National Security and Investment Act."
"Europe will receive the last Russian gas sent via Ukraine’s pipelines in the early hours of the new year as the continent braces for a plunge in temperatures that could hasten the drain on gas reserves. The Russian state energy company, Gazprom, is expected to cut off its exports to Europe through Ukraine’s pipelines on New Year’s Day after a gas transit deal struck between the countries five years ago comes to an end overnight. In the absence of an 11th-hour deal, the halt will mark a historic shift after the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour in early 2022. Russia was once the continent’s biggest supplier of gas but it has lost almost all of its EU customers since the war began, as buyers across central Europe have turned to the US, Norway and Qatar for their supplies. “This is a moment of geopolitical significance,” said Tom Marzec-Manser, an independent gas market analyst. “The end of the transit deal closes a major gas artery connecting Russia’s gas reserves to Europe and could mean that eastern European countries will import more gas from north-western European markets.” The severing of pipeline flows between Russia and Ukraine comes as Kyiv faces increasing pressure to negotiate an end to hostilities amid military setbacks on the eastern front, where soldiers are fighting in freezing conditions, and growing fears that Donald Trump will withdraw US support once he is inaugurated as president on 20 January. Ukraine may be able to meet its own gas demand after the cutoff under normal weather conditions by relying on homegrown fossil fuel production and storage, but the International Energy Agency has said a colder-than-average winter could increase the amount of gas Ukraine needs to import from the EU. The cold snap later this week is already shaping up to be one of the toughest tests for Europe’s gas markets in recent years, coming after a period in which reserves have been burned up at the fastest rate since the energy crisis began. European cities including London, Paris and Berlin can expect temperatures to plunge below zero by the end of the week, well below the norm for this time of year. The spell of freezing weather is expected to drive up demand for gas for heating and hasten withdrawals from Europe’s backup supplies. The EU’s gas reserves have fallen by almost 20% since September, according to official data from Gas Infrastructure Europe. That is considerably more than in the last two winters, when the industry group reported single-digit drops over the same period, in part due to milder weather and weaker demand from heavy industry. The looming cold snap has caused Europe’s benchmark gas price to climb by almost 5% since the start of the week to nearly €49 (£41) a megawatt hour, close to the annual high set in early December. The market is expected to remain under pressure, with forecasts for a colder than usual January and lower levels of wind to generate electricity, which could drive up gas use for home heating and power plants. “The last two winters have been very mild,” Marzec-Manser said. “So this is the first time since the recent weaponisation of gas in Europe that we’re facing the kind of conditions which could stress-test the gas market.” A combination of cold weather, short daylight hours and weak wind speeds in November – known in German as dunkelflaute – has already pushed Europe to use up more of its winter gas supplies than normal for this time of year as homes fire up their heating and power grids seek to replace wind power with electricity from gas generators. Russia will continue to supply countries including Hungary and Serbia with gas via the TurkStream pipeline, which runs under the Black Sea. It will also export more gas via liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. Kyiv has come under pressure from countries including Slovakia, which continues to buy Russian gas, to reopen talks for a new gas flow agreement with the Kremlin. But the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has insisted it will not agree to a deal that financially benefits Russia. By ending the agreement, Ukraine is expected to lose about $800m (£640m) a year in transit fees from Russia, but Gazprom will lose close to $5bn in gas sales to Europe. The collapse in Russia’s gas sales led Gazprom to an annual loss of $7bn in 2023, its first in more than 20 years. Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico, has said it may cut its backup electricity supplies to Ukraine if Kyiv allows the agreement to expire. In response, Zelenskyy accused Fico of acting on behalf of the Kremlin by opening a “second energy front” with Ukraine."
"Shares in the Japanese carmaker Nissan have had their biggest fall since August’s stock market sell-off, as investors turned their attention to the company’s planned tie-up with domestic rivals Honda and Mitsubishi. Nissan’s shares fell by as much as 15% on Friday before regaining some losses to close down 7.8%, in a sign of investor volatility. The fall came less than two weeks after its shares soared by 20% on 17 December, after the first reports that Nissan was to begin talks on a potential merger with Honda. Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi are considering joining forces to better contend with falling sales and competition from Chinese brands. Nissan and Honda have confirmed they have agreed to “start consideration towards a business integration through the establishment of a joint holding company”, and said Mitsubishi would decide on joining by the end of January. A merger between Nissan and Honda would combine Japan’s second and third largest carmakers, and with Mitsubishi would create the world’s third largest carmaker in terms of annual sales, behind their Japanese rival Toyota and Germany’s Volkswagen. Toyota is considered more resilient than its domestic competitors because of its early adoption of hybrid vehicles, while the likes of Nissan and Honda have struggled to find the money to invest in switching away from fossil-fuel models towards cleaner electric vehicles. The slide in Nissan shares on Friday came amid wider gains on Japan’s main stock market, where the Nikkei closed 1.8% higher, taking the the index’s share average to a five-month closing high. Despite the fall in Nissan’s share price, the planned merger with Honda is considered a driver of Japanese stock market optimism, with investors anticipating more corporate growth in the coming year. Kentaro Hayashi, a senior strategist at the investment bank Daiwa Securities, said the merger talks “drove expectations that Japanese firms will continue to improve investor returns”. Honda shares closed 2% higher on Friday and have risen by nearly 20% since the merger talks were first reported, while Nissan’s shares have climbed by 50% over the same period. Analysts have said Nissan’s investors could be disappointed by the expected 5:1 share transfer ratio in any merger deal with Honda, according to data from Nikkei, given the fact that Honda’s market value is about four times larger than that of Nissan. Many of Nissan’s shareholders had been hoping for gains from the merger, after years of crisis and falling profits at the carmaker, as well as the turmoil that followed the arrest of its former chief executive Carlos Ghosn in 2018."
"Donald Trump in recent weeks has expressed a keen interest in privatizing the US Postal Service (USPS) because of its financial losses, the Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing three people with knowledge of the matter. Trump, who begins his second US presidency on 20 January, has discussed his desire to privatize the USPS with Howard Lutnick, his pick for commerce secretary, at his Mar-a-Lago home, the report said. As the Post noted, the move could disrupt consumer shipping and business supply chains while pushing hundreds of thousands of federal workers out of government. Nonetheless, Trump gathered a group of officials advising him on his transition back to the White House and asked them for their views on privatizing the agency. Informed of its annual financial losses, Trump said the USPS should not be subsidized by the government, according to the people who spoke with the Post on the condition of anonymity so that they could speak frankly about private conversations. Trump’s specific plans for possibly overhauling the USPS and privatizing it were not immediately clear. But he feuded with the agency during his first presidency, seeking to compel it to turn over key functions – including labor relations, managing relationships with its largest clients, rate-setting and personnel matters – to the federal treasury department. Meanwhile, before his defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 election after his first presidency, Trump argued that the USPS was incapable of facilitating mail-in voting because he was blocking the agency from accessing emergency funding. Ultimately, as the Post noted, the USPS delivered nearly 98% of voters’ ballots to election officials within three days despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The USPS is older than the US itself, having been founded in 1775. It became a financially self-sustaining agency in 1970 and is one of the most well-liked federal agencies, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center study cited by the Post. In the fiscal year ending 30 September, the USPS lost $9.5bn after modernizing facilities and equipment did little to offset declines in mail volume as well as a parcel shipping business that was slower than anticipated, according to the Post’s reporting. The postal service’s annual financial report disclosed nearly $80bn in liabilities. Reuters contributed reporting"
"People with disabilities are facing potential hardship because banks are scrapping trust accounts that allow money to be managed safely on their behalf. Victims awarded personal injury settlements and those with learning difficulties are among those facing “severe consequences” as accounts are closed or frozen by high street banks and building societies, according to campaigners. Trust accounts are typically set up by representatives of a vulnerable individual to protect their assets and ensure a stable financial future. A disabled person’s trust gives an appointed trustee a legal right to administer funds or property on behalf of the beneficiary. The assets, which may include compensation for serious injury, do not count towards means-testing and are eligible for tax relief. However, since Covid nearly all high street banks have withdrawn the service citing costs and complex compliance laws. In recent weeks, Nationwide building society became the latest provider to pull out of the market. The closures have removed a lifeline from learning-impaired people who are already financially excluded, according to the charity Mencap, which warns that ordinary accounts may put them at risk of financial abuse. Some trustees have been unable to pay for essentials such as carer support and mobile phone contracts because a trust account has been closed. “We’re hearing from an increasing number of families of people with a learning disability who don’t know where to turn,” said Mencap’s chief executive, Jon Sparkes. “Some already have a disabled person’s trust account in place but have been warned it is now due to close and others can’t set one up because banks no longer offer this type of service.” James Trotman says he had to cancel Christmas plans for his disabled son after Nationwide froze the £28,000 in his trust account without warning, pending closure. “We were informed in September that the account would have to close by 23 December as Nationwide was ceasing to offer the service,” he said. “When we tried to withdraw the funds we were told that all trust accounts had been blocked as they had to be re-verified before they were closed. I provided all the requested information, but a month later we were still unable to access the money.” Another trustee who did not wish to be named said the Nationwide trust account that provided an income for her disabled brother was frozen without warning, leaving her unable to replace his broken laptop. “Nationwide had written to say it intended to close this account and required the original trust document and the HMRC registration,” she said. “Meanwhile, without warning, it put a security block on the account. We immediately took the required documents to the local branch. That was nearly three weeks ago, but the account has not been restored and Nationwide won’t tell us when we will receive the funds.” The funds of both accounts were released after the Guardian intervened. Nationwide said it was closing all trust accounts except for bare trusts, typically set up by parents for their children, adding that those needing accounts for adults must look elsewhere. Beneficiaries of bare trusts assume responsibility for the funds as soon as they come of age, making such trusts unsuitable for those with cognitive impairment. A Nationwide spokesperson said that accounts were being blocked until required paperwork was submitted to meet legal and regulatory obligations. “We accept we could have been clearer that restrictions would be placed on these accounts and that there have been delays in resolving the issues with some customers when they have supplied us information for review.” The exodus from the trust market has left few options for families wanting to secure the financial future of adult dependants. Metro is the only high street bank that still offers the service, although accounts holding less than £25,000 incur a £5-a-month fee. Cater Allen, Santander’s private banking arm, also provides trust accounts but applicants must be referred by a solicitor or financial adviser. “Trust accounts are now almost extinct as an accessible service,” said Donna Holmes, a partner at the law firm Anthony Collins. “Clear guidance [from the regulator] is desperately needed in order to give trustees and beneficiaries peace of mind that access to their funds is not going to be cut off without warning, and if a service is being withdrawn, that a suitable alternative is provided.” The Financial Conduct Authority said it was aware of the impact that the closure of trust funds could have on vulnerable people. “Banks and building societies are able to choose which products they offer,” said a spokesperson for the regulator. “However, we urge firms to think carefully before withdrawing a product, where this is likely to impact vulnerable consumers, and to mitigate the impact where possible. “We have spoken to disability charities and account providers to understand more about the issues caused by lack of access to trust accounts.”"
"1) Tigers’ plight summed up by brilliance and defeat This is not the first time Leicester have proved themselves capable of the sort of rugby not even a team like Exeter can live with. And it is not the first time they have proved themselves incapable of sustaining it. Brilliance and defeat. It is one sure sign of a collective in turmoil, knowing they should be in a better place than they are but consistently freezing just as they threaten to attain it. And then the sight of their equable director of rugby, Geordan Murphy, who in his day represented the very definition of coolness above a storm, dissolving into a finger-pointing fury with one of Welford Road’s own further hints at a meltdown in Leicester’s core. Which will out, the brilliance of the personnel or the unprecedented pressures of life at the bottom with a team like Saracens in pursuit? These are strange times. Michael Aylwin • Match report: Leicester 22-31 Exeter 2) Wasps looking over their shoulders after defeat “Christmas is cancelled” was how Dai Young summed up his feelings after watching Wasps throw away a 17-point lead against Harlequins, and it was hard not to sympathise. He has been at the club since 2011 and it clearly hurts him deeply to see Wasps so lacklustre for large spells in their festive fixture in front of a bumper crowd. With one win from six matches, Wasps are now in a similar boat to Leicester. A side who have won the Premiership title six times are now nervously looking over their shoulder because in all likelihood Saracens, now up to -13 points, will catch both of them. They meet each other in the middle of February, when internationals will be focusing on the Six Nations, and tantalisingly in early May. Worcester and London Irish can still get dragged into it, but already those two fixtures are looking significant. Gerard Meagher • Match report: Wasps 22-28 Harlequins 3) Saracens’ trip to Exeter loaded with significance Next Sunday, the Premiership will see its biggest match of the season so far when Saracens visit Exeter, and not just because it involves the sides that have contested the last two play-off finals at Twickenham. The Chiefs have been the most vocal of the champions’ critics following their fine and points deduction for breaching the salary cap regulations, and there are unlikely to be any seasonal greetings from the hosts. Exeter have won the last three Premiership matches between the sides at the ground but, with Sarries set on survival rather than the play-offs, they have little scope for error, still 17 points adrift at the bottom. All the more so because they face being without at least 12 players for all or part of the Six Nations during which six matches will be played. Fairness does not end with the salary cap. A play-off for the bottom four? Paul Rees • Saracens 47-13 Bristol 4) Rees-Zammit deserves Wales reward from Pivac Louis Rees-Zammit turned in a performance for Gloucester against Worcester that has everyone on both sides of the Severn talking. Rees-Zammit scored two tries and set up another as he continued to add to his burgeoning reputation in Gloucester’s 36-3 win. He is quick, very quick, and big enough for senior rugby too, despite being not turning 19 until February. He is also Welsh, as he pointed out on social media after the match, and while he could in theory qualify to play for England in future on residency grounds, his destiny is in red rather than white. The question now is whether Wayne Pivac will pick him for the Six Nations. Pivac spoke of how he wanted to make better use of Wales’s exiles programme recently. What better way to do so than include Rees-Zammit when he names his squad in the new year? GM 5) Sharks scent top-four finish Northampton lost their place at the top of the Premiership following their sixth defeat at Sale in their past seven league visits. Exeter and Gloucester are the only visiting teams to have won in the league at the AJ Bell Stadium in 2019 and with Saracens battling at the other end of the table, the Sharks are aiming for a top-four finish. “I think we’ve got a squad to operate at the top end of the division,” said their director of rugby, Steve Diamond. “The top four at Christmas was always a target. We go to Bath next and who knows where we can be in the next fortnight.” Diamond is used to operating on a budget some way below the salary cap, but not this season when, for example, he has to keep four international wings happy. Paul Rees 6) Exiles struggle with Premiership pace It was only last month that London Irish were hammering Leicester 36-11 and making a bit of a statement about their Premiership potential this season. If they serve up any more turkeys like their 38-10 home defeat to Bath, however, they will be swiftly dragged back down into the dogfight at the bottom of the table, with Saturday’s game at Worcester suddenly assuming extra significance. It does not help that their All Black wing, Waisake Naholo, will not be back from New Zealand – where he is attending the birth of his first child – until the middle of January. On top of that, Ireland international Paddy Jackson has now pulled a hamstring. The club’s director of rugby, Declan Kidney, has been around long enough to know one bad day is not necessarily the end of the world but, equally, Irish are now finding the Premiership is relentlessly tough. “With the way the league has gone so far, everybody is beating everybody,” said Kidney. “Worcester will be hurting, they had a similar result to ourselves and will have an extra day’s turnaround and home advantage. It will be a big challenge but we knew every game would be this year.” Robert Kitson London Irish 10-38 Bath"
"Andy Murray, who has struggled with injury since the Davis Cup finals six weeks ago, has withdrawn from the ATP Cup, due to start in three cities across Australia on Friday, and the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on 20 January. Minor setbacks to his rehab programme and slow recovery from a pelvic problem have dissuaded the former world No 1 from going back on the Tour until February. He will continue practising at home to build up fitness. “I’ve worked so hard to get myself into a situation where I can play at the top level and I’m gutted I’m not going to be able to play in Australia in January,” he said on Saturday night. “After the Australian Open this year, when I wasn’t sure whether I’d be able to play again, I was excited about coming back to Australia and giving my best, and that makes this even more disappointing for me. Unfortunately I’ve had a setback recently and as a precaution, need to work through that before I get back on court competing.” Murray’s withdrawal from the new ATP Cup initially threw into confusion the participation of the Great Britain team, who needed his protected ranking to earn a place in the tournament. Britain’s leading player, Kyle Edmund, who was in excellent form in the Davis Cup finals, did not have a sufficiently high ATP ranking to enable the team to make the list, and has since committed to playing in Qatar and Adelaide. However, it is understood the GB team, who will be based in Sydney, will now seek a replacement for Murray. Great Britain have drawn Bulgaria in their first tie of Group C in the new 24-team format, with Dan Evans, ranked 42nd in the world, to open the tie against the world No 424, Dimitar Kuzmanov. Murray was scheduled to play his old rival Grigor Dimitrov in the night match. Murray had to be persuaded to use his protected ranking when the final details of the ATP Cup were confirmed, so his doubts about his fitness have been in place for a little while. When he chose to spend Christmas at home with his young family rather than commit to his usual winter training block in Miami doubts grew. However, he gave no clear indication until Saturday that he was not fit to travel to Australia. He picked up an elbow injury when winning his first tournament in two and a half years, in Antwerp in October, and stretched his physical resources to the limit in a tough five-setter against the then world No 179 Tallon Griekspoor in the Davis Cup, during which a groin strain flared. Murray’s team hope he can return in February – he has entered Rotterdam and Montpellier – but he has given no guarantees. His withdrawal from the Australian leg of his season is a blow to what was shaping as an encouraging comeback from his second hip operation in January. His movement, speed and stamina were improving steadily and, after winning a doubles tournament at Queen’s in the summer, his confidence was high. Given the physical trauma of surgery and the frustrating stretches he endured after his first hip operation the previous January, Murray can look back on 2019 with satisfaction. He won 11 of 18 matches on the Tour, won titles in singles and doubles, earned $369,000 in ticking-over prize money and had a major documentary, Resurfacing, which went into some detail about his fight to return. However, he has said several times he will not rush his comeback, at the age of 32, in what is clearly the final stage of his long career. Murray hopes to keep playing for as long as he can and his major target in 2020 will be defending his Olympic title in Tokyo. That seems the most realistic route back for Murray to win major honours, given the early matches in the Olympic tournament are the best of three sets. The prospect of enduring a fortnight’s examination of his fitness and form in best‑of‑five matches at the highest level in a grand slam tournament do not look promising. Murray has been more relaxed about his career since coming through the hip problem, which threatened to end his playing days after his first-round lost to Roberto Bautista Agut at the Australian Open 12 months ago. Patience has been a virtue so far; he is not about to abandon that and risk a further setback."

"David Richards, the head of British motor racing’s governing body, has said it would be a major oversight if Lewis Hamilton is not recognised with a knighthood in the new year honours list. Hamilton won his sixth Formula One world championship last season and is second only to Michael Schumacher, who won seven, as the most successful driver in history. He is has only seven fewer grand prix wins than the German’s record of 91. Richards has been a strong supporter of the Labour peer Lord Hain, who wrote to the prime minister in November urging that Hamilton should be honoured. “Naturally as the governing body of motorsport in the UK we wholeheartedly support Peter Hain,” said Richards, the chairman of Motorsport UK. “I can’t think of anyone more worthy of that recognition than Lewis. It would be a major oversight if that is not recognised in the new year honours.” Hamilton received an OBE in 2008 after he won his first championship. Since then Bradley Wiggins, Mo Farah, Andy Murray and Alastair Cook have been knighted. Three F1 drivers have been made sirs, all many years after they retired: Jackie Stewart, Stirling Moss and Jack Brabham. Richards believes Hamilton,’s achievements are equally worthy of recognition, not least because he has had to work so hard. The 34-year-old grew up on a council estate in Stevenage and remains the only black driver in F1. His father, Anthony, had to commit himself personally and financially to helping his son’s career. “Lewis is far more remarkable in that he did not come from a privileged background,” Richards said. “He and his father worked incredibly hard to get into karting and up the steps of the ladder. It was sheer hard graft, not gifted to him on a plate. They made huge sacrifices and that makes his achievements even more extraordinary.” Hamilton could go on to beat both Schumacher’s records and Richards said the Mercedes driver’s inspirational achievements deserve acknowledgement. “He is a role model for underprivileged children in the UK to show them that anything is possible,” he said. “I hope he uses that to help and leave a legacy for other kids to show their ambitions are achievable.” When asked about a knighthood earlier this year Hamilton said: “I don’t really like to think too much about it. The fact people have mentioned it, it’s already an honour but it’s not been something I’ve been chasing in my life.” Hamilton was beaten into second place by Ben Stokes for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award but the former cricketer Darren Gough also said Hamilton should be honoured. “I’m a massive F1 fan and Lewis Hamilton doesn’t get the credit I think he deserves. He should have a knighthood by now. Six world titles, 84 grand prix wins but he’s just got caught in a year where Ben Stokes has been out of this world.”"
"Saints coach Sean Payton says the club has no immediate plans to sign Antonio Brown after including him in a workout with six free-agent receivers Friday morning. Payton says the Saints are mainly doing their due diligence “on all of those players” and looking at how available players can help the team as it prepares to enter the playoffs. Brown has not played since the New England Patriots cut him on 20 September amid multiple sexual assault accusations which have spawned an ongoing league investigation of the receiver. Payton says the team would still have to seek information from the NFL on whether it would allow Brown to play if New Orleans chose to sign him. Brown is a four-time All-Pro but has now been released by three teams since the end of last season, when he was released by Pittsburgh after being a no-show for the club’s season finale. He also was cut earlier this year by Oakland. The Saints remain alive for the No 1 overall seed and home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs entering the final weekend of regular-season play. New Orleans will secure the top seed if they defeeat Carolina, if the Lions tie or beat the Packers and if the Seahawks tie or beat the 49ers. They can fall no lower than the No 3 seed and are guaranteed a home playoff game as NFC South champions."
"Rob Burrow has said a meeting with Doddie Weir and the inspiration he provides for people with motor neurone disease has helped him, after the Leeds Rhinos legend was diagnosed with the condition at the age of 37. Burrow retired in 2017 having played 492 times for the club. He won eight Super League titles with the Rhinos – and named man of the match in two Grand Finals – during a hugely successful career, mostly at half-back but latterly as a hooker, and he revealed on Thursday he had MND, a degenerative disease that affects how nerves in the brain and spinal cord function. There is currently no cure and Burrow said of his life expectancy: “I haven’t got a goal in my head but unrealistic is probably 10 years, realistic, I think, is five.” Last week the former England and Great Britain international met Weir, the former Scotland rugby union international who was diagnosed with MND in 2016 and has raised huge awareness of the condition, and said his “unbelievable” support has not only readied him for what lies ahead, but inspired him to support Weir’s fundraising efforts. “Listening to Doddie makes you think ‘wow’,” he said. “I will be inundated with people trying to help me, but as Doddie says: ‘What would the postman do or the guy who works at a shop?’ They might not get diagnosed for months and I got it in three weeks because I was lucky I had people who could get me private. Doddie said he had it for a year before he was diagnosed. “Because there’s no help for it, I’m more than happy to get on board with Doddie and maybe start something up down here where people can be helped. In 10 years they might heal someone and find a cure, so I am massively keen to help. “Life changes now and it’ll never be the same, but if I can raise awareness, I’m keen to do it. Doddie has done three years of work, so I’ve got it at the best time in a way. He had nothing, he had to start doing this. I can’t be better off in the circumstances really.” Burrow discovered he had MND last week and admitted while he is “fine” with knowing he cannot be cured, leaving his three young children and wife behind is the most difficult aspect of the diagnosis to comprehend. “I know they will be alright after,” he said. “I’m fine with dying, it’s not being able to watch your kids grow up. I’m feeling really good, I am the best out of my family at feeling good about it. It’s not the worst thing in the world; the worst thing in the world is your kids getting poorly.” Burrow is hoping to be involved in a new trial for a drug to potentially treat MND in March and will continue his work as Leeds’s reserve coach for as long as his health allows, despite him already beginning to lose his voice. “That is a bit weird, but however long I can speak for, I’ll coach,” he says. “I’ll be there Saturday before we break up for Christmas and hopefully by then it’s died down a bit and I can get on as normal.” He insisted he wanted the news made public now so he could enjoy Christmas with his family, but said he was unsure whether his career in a high-impact sport played a part in his diagnosis. “The MRI came back fine, so you presume it’s nothing to do with that. They said – and a lot of things are vague – maybe my muscles had worked too hard. It’s just the way it is. “I’m young – the average age [of diagnosis] is about 60. The average lifespan is three years and older people might give up, but I’m not going to give up. It’s a challenge, but I won’t lie down. I didn’t do it in rugby and I won’t start now.” www.virginmoneygiving.com/fund/robburrow"
"A number of sporting events have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Keep up-to-date with the latest developments here. March The women’s T20 World Cup concludes in Australia, with the hosts recovering from an opening defeat to India to join them in the semi-finals with England. South Africa are favourites to join them, with the final on Sunday 8 March. The men’s and women’s Six Nations are set to conclude, but matches involving Italy have been postponed – although England’s men’s game in Rome on 14 March is set to go ahead. Formula One returns with the traditional curtain-raiser in Melbourne, which is set to go ahead despite coronavirus fears. Lewis Hamilton will begin his bid to match Michael Schumacher’s haul of seven world titles. Elsewhere, it’s arguably the biggest week in horse racing at the Cheltenham Festival, while England play two Test matches in Sri Lanka. Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will battle for the final Euro 2020 places as 16 teams are cut down to four in the play-offs. England’s women head to the States to face the USA, Japan and Spain in the SheBelieves Cup. The Major League Baseball season gets under way, and the men’s and women’s Boat Races take place on the Thames. April The first LPGA major of the year, the ANA Inspiration, is held in California. One week later, it’s over to Augusta for the first men’s golf major of the year, with Tiger Woods defending his Masters title. The Chinese Grand Prix, slated for Shanghai, has been postponed indefinitely, while the first-ever Vietnam Grand Prix in Hanoi remains in the balance. Other sporting highlights include the Grand National – with Tiger Roll chasing a hat-trick of wins – the start of cricket’s County Championship season, the London Marathon and two weeks of tension at the Crucible, as Judd Trump battles to retain his world snooker title. May It’s a month of finals, with the men’s and women’s FA Cup showpieces at Wembley, the women’s Champions League in Vienna and the men’s Champions League in Istanbul. Not forgetting the Scottish Cup, Europa League and EFL play-offs, with football’s richest game, the Championship play-off final, offering a lucrative place in the Premier League. The first of cycling’s three Grand Tours, the Giro d’Italia, is set to start in Budapest, although the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy means the entire event is in doubt. The Netherlands hosts an F1 Grand Prix, with the Indy 500 and Monaco GP also taking place. Thrill seekers might also want to head to Cardiff for the Nitro World Games – the largest action sports event ever held in the UK. June Another event with a question mark over it, Euro 2020 is set to be held this month in 12 different cities from Dublin to Baku. England and Wales are the only qualified home nations so far, with Scotland and Republic of Ireland in the play-offs. England will play their group games at Wembley, plus the semi-finals and final - if they get that far. Gareth Southgate’s side are in Group D with Croatia, Czech Republic and a play-off winner. Wales are in Group A, with a trip to face Italy and two other games in Azerbaijan, against Switzerland and Turkey. If that sounds tough, spare a thought for the play-off winners who end up in Group F – with Germany, France and holders Portugal. Sixteen teams will progress from the groups into a straight knockout. The Copa América takes place in Argentina and Colombia, and there’s plenty of action away from football. England play three home Tests against the West Indies, and there are three golf majors as the US Open, women’s US Open and women’s PGA are contested in the US. There are also three big rugby union finals, with the Premiership, Pro14 and Super Rugby trophies to be won. The Tour de France sets off from Nice on the long road to Paris. It’s hard to bet against another Team Ineos winner, but will it be defending champion Egan Bernal, or can Geraint Thomas or Chris Froome secure another British win? Speaking of which, this could be a big month for Andy Murray, with Queen’s Club and a potential Wimbledon return as he continues his fightback from injury. July It’s the biggest sporting event on earth; 11,000 athletes from more than 200 nations, competing in 339 events across 33 sports. The 32nd Olympic Games, the second to be held in Tokyo, will dominate the sporting summer – providing coronavirus does not lead to a postponement. While Rio 2016 suffered from big distances between venues and poor infrastructure, that shouldn’t be a problem in Tokyo. Thirteen of the venues, including the National Stadium, are within 5km of the athletes’ village, although the marathon and walking events will be in the northern city of Sapporo, due to concerns over heat. British medal hopes include Dina Asher-Smith in the 200m and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in heptathlon, Adam Peaty in the pool, Laura Kenny in the velodrome and 11-year-old skateboarder Sky Brown. New events to watch out for include 3-on-3 basketball, surfing, speed climbing, skateboarding and karate, while baseball and softball will be popular draws in Japan after being brought back to the Games. The British summer of sport should also be in full swing. Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep are looking to defend their Wimbledon titles, while Lewis Hamilton will go for a seventh British Grand Prix crown at Silverstone. After Shane Lowry’s memorable win at Portrush last year, can anyone end the long wait for an English winner at Royal St George’s in The Open? August The ECB’s controversial new cricket tournament, The Hundred, finally kicks off this summer. Eight new city franchises have drafted players, with men’s and women’s teams competing for a place in the inaugural finals in August. Time will tell if the bold new format - 15 six-ball overs, then a 10-ball final over - will draw more casual fans than the disbanded Women’s Super League, or the men’s county-based T20 Blast, which will continue. Two weeks after the Olympic closing ceremony, the torch is passed to the Paralympic Games. Also set for Tokyo, the Paralympics will welcome 4,400 athletes competing in over 500 events. British names to watch out for include runner Sophie Hahn, former swimming medallist turned para-canoeist Charlotte Henshaw and Amy Truesdale, who is chasing gold in the new para-taekwondo event. Elsewhere, England complete what’s sure to be an entertaining Test series against Pakistan, while the year’s third and final grand tour, the Vuelta, begins with a jaunt to the Dutch city of Utrecht. The domestic football season kicks off too, with the Premier League and Football League returning early in August. September Europe are bidding to retain the Ryder Cup trophy they won emphatically in France two years ago, as the USA takes over hosting duties. Europe lead 7-2 in wins since the turn of the century and will fancy their chances of an away win at Whistling Straits. The lakeside Wisconsin course looks and feels like Scottish links, complete with sheep, stone bridges and testing weather conditions. September also sees T20 Blast finals day, the Royal London Cup final and the county championship’s closing rounds. The Tour of Britain begins with a first-ever visit to Cornwall, while the road cycling world championships take place amid the peaks of Vaud and Valais in Switzerland. October There’s a double helping of T20 World Cups in 2020, with the men’s tournament also taking place in Australia at some of cricket’s most iconic venues, from the Gabba to the MCG. England will be on the hunt for another trophy, and revenge after their dramatic late defeat to the West Indies in 2016. The Windies, the hosts or familiar foes New Zealand are all potential semi-final opponents for England if they progress from their Super 12s group. Ireland and Scotland, meanwhile, will hope to make it out of their preliminary groups after qualifying for the tournament. Elsewhere, the Champions League group stages will be heating up, and F1 enters the home straight with races in Japan and the USA. Super League’s showpiece finale, the grand final, takes place at Old Trafford, before an Ashes series between England and Australia which concludes at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. November The Formula One season reaches its climax in Abu Dhabi, and there are year-ending showdowns in men’s and women’s tennis, plus golf in Dubai. Two of the biggest horse races in the world, the Melbourne and Breeders’ Cups, will be contested, and the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations will kick off – although the hosts are yet to be confirmed. December The sporting year ends with a few festive staples – the PDC world darts championship returns, and there will be the usual post-Christmas football and horse racing action. The Club World Cup will return to Qatar, 12 months on from Liverpool’s victory. The European cross-country athletics championships will be held in Ireland, snooker’s UK Championship will be played out in York, and one hero from the past year will win the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award. … and here’s what you might have missed: January A big month for tennis began with the ATP Cup, a new team event won by Novak Djokovic’s Serbia, who beat Rafa Nadal’s Spain in the final. Djokovic wasn’t done there, going on to win the Australian Open final after an epic battle with Dominic Thiem. Sofia Kenin was the unexpected women’s champion, fighting back to beat Garbiñe Muguruza in a classic final. From Djokovic’s altercation with an umpire to the bushfire haze that hung over Melbourne, the tournament was beset by controversies. In cricket, England completed a dramatic comeback to win the Test series in South Africa, with victory at the Wanderers securing a 3-1 win. In football, Aston Villa booked their place at Wembley with a two-legged semi-final win over Leicester. Dean Smith’s side will play Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, after they limped over the line in a derby double-header with United. Elsewhere, Peter Wright shocked the darting world on New Year’s Day, beating favourite Michael van Gerwen 7-3 in the PDC world final. Wayne Warren took the BDO title, becoming the oldest ever champion at 57 – but the event suffered from poor crowds and low prize money. In snooker, Stuart Bingham beat Ali Carter and off-table distractions to win the Masters. February In the first weekend of the month, all eyes were on Miami for Super Bowl LIV. The Kansas City Chiefs earned their first NFL championship for 50 years, rallying to beat a San Francisco side who had one hand on the Vince Lombardi trophy in the fourth quarter. The NBA’s All-Star weekend in Chicago was overshadowed by the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, in a helicopter crash. Tyson Fury became a world heavyweight champion again, completing a remarkable recovery from depression and addiction issues. He ended Deontay Wilder’s unbeaten round by seventh-round knockout in Las Vegas; his opponent later claimed that his elaborate ring-walk costume had sapped his energy. The Six Nations kicked off, with France surging towards a potential grand slam with home wins over England and Italy and an away victory in Cardiff – before the coronavirus outbreak left organisers battling to complete the tournament. Cycling’s UAE Tour was cancelled with two stages left to race, with Chris Froome among the field of riders quarantined before being allowed to return home. Manchester City were hit by a two-season ban from the Champions League, but kept their on-field focus to beat Real Madrid in their last-16, first-leg encounter. It was a welcome boost for English clubs after Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea lost their first legs. Liverpool’s unbeaten Premier League run was also ended by Watford, but they remain on course to canter to the title."
"The King George VI Chase, more than any other major jumps race, achieves an impressive balance in demanding both speed and stamina from its contenders, making it tricky to choose between the claims of Cyrname and Lostintranslation, both tackling the race for the first time. But the impression remains that Cyrname did not want to go much further when he triumphed over Altior last month and the extra three furlongs he faces at Kempton will be a serious test for a headstrong animal. Some have questioned whether Lostintranslation (3.05) has the pace to cope well with a strongly run King George but he regularly ran well at shorter trips last season, against a horse who is now a top-class two-miler. His superb fencing will help him and it is easy to imagine him outstaying most of these rivals in the straight. Thistlecrack, his stablemate at Colin Tizzard’s yard, can also go well. Clan Des Obeaux has something to prove after three consecutive defeats but these conditions certainly showed him to advantage a year ago. 1.20 Kempton It has been a quiet start to the season for Tom George, at least until Saturday’s Grade One triumph, but Doctor Dex has been serving him well and can do so again here. He bumped into a rival running the race of their life when second here last month, a race in which he was the only hold-up runner to make much impact. This hotter contest may work out better for him. 1.55 Kempton Paul Nicholls fields two hugely promising youngsters for this renewal of the Kauto Star, but Master Tommytucker and Danny Whizzbang lack the experience of a couple of their rivals and that may tell. Black Op gave Champ a run for his money at Newbury and is respected but Tizzard’s Slate House is hard to get away from. He seemed on the point of winning Cheltenham’s BetVictor Gold Cup Chase when knuckling over two-out last month and that is classy form in this context. 2.10 Wetherby An 11lb rise is not to be sneered at but Bennys King impressed in pulling clear of a packed field for the Peter O’Sullevan Memorial last time. He was short of peak fitness on his only defeat since joining Dan Skelton and can improve again for this step up in distance. Skelton won this race two years ago. 2.30 Kempton Fusil Raffles has been the talking horse at Seven Barrows but the form of his Wincanton win last month is not the strongest on offer here. He will face a stern challenge from his stablemate Epatante, so impressive in landing the Gerry Feilden and disappointing only at Cheltenham since arriving from France."
"Ashley Giles has said there is “no doubt” England want Moeen Ali to make a Test comeback but is mindful that a packed international schedule is heaping more pressure on players than ever before. Moeen, 32, has made himself unavailable for selection in the longer format since the end of last summer and turned down a berth on the Test leg of the South Africa tour that began this week with a two-day warm-up match in Benoni. Writing for the Guardian last week, Moeen said: “It just felt too soon.” Giles, the director of England cricket, met Moeen in Birmingham on Monday to discuss the break – one that is hoped will freshen up his game – and suggested Ed Smith’s selection panel will remain patient with the player. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Giles said: “We need to work with him and, as much as us picking him, he needs to make sure he’s ready to come back into that environment. “There is no doubt that we want Moeen back in that environment at some point. He’s shown his abilities at Test and ODI level. Sometimes you just need to take a break from the game and part of that is being able to take time out and work on your cricket but also perhaps rediscovering your love for the game. “We could have an injury in South Africa and say: ‘Mo, would you? Can you?’ But we have to be careful with that. As much as we want him back he has to be ready as well. So that’s why we have to work with him. We wouldn’t want to put someone back in that spotlight if they didn’t feel they are ready.” Giles believes a number of England’s all-format players are yet to get the World Cup and Ashes summer out of their systems, but the fixture list makes this problematic. South Africa is the second of three tours this winter, before the Indian Premier League and a home international summer that includes the inaugural edition of The Hundred before a full tour of India during the next off-season that straddles October’s T20 World Cup in Australia. “The game is stressful full stop for a lot of our guys,” Giles said. “Looking back at the summer, I don’t know whether a lot of our guys have had time to get over it. When you look at what they went through, almost three weeks from the end of the season many were off to New Zealand then into this next year, which is crazy in terms of schedules. “We have a psychologist on board all the time, we have a mini-committee within the team who keep player wellbeing as a top priority on the agenda. It’s a really important issue for us and player workloads are going to be really important for us in the next 12 months – we need to be looking right down the track. “I don’t remember a more pressured time in cricket in terms of looking after your people and the pressure on winning all the time.”"
"“When the time came to say goodbye, I told Pat I loved him and I appreciated him,” Patrick Aristhene says as he remembers the moment before the machines were switched off and his best friend, the boxer Patrick Day, slipped away into death. Four days earlier, on 12 October 2019, Day had been knocked out in the last round of his 22nd professional fight, against Charles Conwell, in Chicago. He fell into a coma and the doctors soon knew they could not save him. On a beautiful late December afternoon in Rockville Centre, near New York, with a low winter sun as gentle as the subject of our interview is hard, Aristhene recalls his final words in hospital. “I told Pat, ‘Hold it down that side and watch over everybody. I’ll hold it down this side till I see you again.’ I believe I’ll see Pat again. I believe the human spirit is powerful and, when we die, it goes on a journey. The Egyptians said it: ‘Death is only the beginning.’” Many fighters have died in the ring, and there have been five boxing fatalities this year, but the death of 27-year-old Patrick Day resonates. He was not impoverished or desperate. Boxing, far from being his only hope, was his choice out of many options. His father was a doctor and his mother an editorial assistant at the UN. Day was college educated and his intelligence was matched by his eloquence, charm and dedication to boxing as a super‑welterweight (154lb) who had been ranked in the world’s top 10 by the IBF and WBC. “Pat didn’t waste a moment of his life,” says Aristhene, a former Golden Gloves champion, “and he did everything with good intentions. We lived on the same block in Freeport [Long Island, New York] our whole lives and, as a kid, I could run to his house in seven seconds. Our parents are from Haiti and they put us together as babies. He was born in August 1992 and I was born that October. We both majored in food and nutrition and bounced most decisions off each other. “Patrick was pure-hearted. He would ask me to take a second look at people I didn’t trust. Patrick would say: ‘Look at their heart.’ He encouraged me to give them another chance. There were times I’d say: ‘Pat, this guy is taking advantage of you,’ and he’d agree. I was the realist, he was the optimist. We balanced each other. Our last messages are right here.” Aristhene opens his phone. “Here we go. Saturday October 12.” We read the stream of messages that fateful day as they texted each other from Freeport and Chicago. After Aristhene wished him good luck against Conwell, Day wrote these words to his oldest friend: “Appreciate you and love you, my brother. Tonight I’m going to do my thang out there.” Aristhene responded: “Love you man. I’m excited for the world to see what you got.” He still felt a secret foreboding. “I was anxious because I had a dream the night before that somebody was going to get hurt bad. In the dream I was in Chicago at the fight. I’m trying to get through the crowd, saying: ‘Who won?’ A voice tells me: ‘Someone got knocked out bad.’ In the dream I couldn’t tell who it was. So on the night of the fight I had such pain in my stomach. I didn’t care who won. I just wanted Pat to be safe.” The two Patricks fell for boxing as teenagers. The Days lived across the street from Joe Higgins, a former marine and firefighter who ran the local boxing gym. Higgins kept his garage doors open so the boys could see a heavy bag dangling from the rafters. He knew they would be curious and sure enough, when he was a skinny 14-year-old, Day crossed Buchanan Street and began hitting the bag. Higgins chided him – but only because he was slapping rather than punching. It was not long before Day and Aristhene joined Higgins at his Freeport PAL gym. The trainer promised Day’s mother, Lyssa, her son would learn many good habits through boxing. Lyssa disliked boxing, but she knew Higgins was a good man. He was respected throughout Freeport. Apart from the hope he spread through boxing, he and his brother Tim had been among the first firemen who went into the burning Twin Towers on 9/11. Tim died, after saving many lives. Joe survived – but he carries the darkness of that terrible day in hidden corners of his mind. Aristhene smiles when I ask if he and Day were intimidated by Higgins. “Coach Joe is only intimidating in the sense of discipline. When he was around, you didn’t say a curse word. You minded your p’s and q’s. To have him in the neighbourhood was good.” Did he and Day realise Higgins was haunted by 9/11? “Pat and me would get a lift to the gym with Coach Joe. During those car rides, we began to understand the demons he’s still battling with. But it was only when Pat and I became men that we understood the trauma.” Aristhene and Day revered Seanie Monaghan – a professional fighter from Long Island who was 11 years older than them. Monaghan was Higgins’s star boxer. He came to boxing late but reeled off 28 successive wins in front of a vociferous following. The light-heavyweight retired last April with a 29‑3 record and his reputation as New York’s most popular fighter intact. “Seanie’s our big brother,” Aristhene says. “Pat loved going to the Long Beach boardwalk where you felt Seanie’s clout. If we told anyone there we boxed with Sean Monaghan they’d say: ‘Whatever you want is free.’ At clubs you just had to say Seanie’s name and you were in. Sean was a hero – and our friend.” Monaghan, who is now 38, picks me up from Freeport station on a cold afternoon. His warmth fills the car and, despite his grief for Day, Monaghan makes our meeting feel natural. He only pauses when holding the keys to Higgins’s gym – a small blue brick building in the middle of a Freeport park. “I’ve not been inside since we lost Pat,” he says. “Coach Joe closed it for a few weeks and I’ve not been able to face coming back.” Old posters, featuring some of Monaghan’s greatest nights in the ring and Day’s past fights, line the walls. The blue ring is empty. But, rather than being an ominous symbol of the place where Day lost his life, it feels like home. We sit on the ring apron as Monaghan remembers his friend. “Patrick walked in here around 2005,” he says. “I was 25 and he was this skinny kid. He always had a smile, very humble, a really pleasant kid. When Patrick first came to the track where Coach Joe made us run, I lapped him. Then, when he got older, I couldn’t keep up with him. He was smoking that track. Patrick fought at 154 to 160 [lb] and I was 175, but we sparred a lot. He was tough. I sparred beasts like Artur Beterbiev [the world’s most ferocious light-heavyweight] but Patrick was so competitive. He always tried to get me and he was fast. “In the summer we opened the steel doors and people watched me and Patrick put on some shows. I sparred more with Patrick than anyone else. We ran the track together, did our gym work together, did everything together. He was a wonderful person who had such heart.” Aristhene says something similar. “Pat had more determination than anyone I’ve met. He wasn’t good at sports like basketball. But his determination made him good at defence. He was so tenacious he always found a way to do well. At school his nickname was ‘Straight A Day’. He got straight A’s in everything. He wrote that nickname on his headgear and shoes. “Pat was the golden child but I’d get into fights at school. I’d get suspended. Pat said: ‘You should think about boxing.’ But he lost his first three amateur fights. I’ll never forget we were in his kitchen making pancakes. He said: ‘Man, if I lose the next fight, I’m done.’ But he won, and won again. When Pat won the Golden Gloves I was like: ‘I got to get mine.’ How many Golden Gloves champions live on the same block like Pat and me? That’s testament to Coach Joe.” Our reflections are interrupted by the arrival of Higgins. A strapping man, with a cap covering his bald head, he sounds exactly like a tough New York firefighter. But, as the man who introduced Patrick to boxing and worked the corner in every one of his amateur and professional fights, Higgins is grieving. He explains how, after he reopened the gym last month, he could not bear the thought of it being associated with boxing. Higgins resolved to turn it into a fitness centre. But, as the weeks pass and young men ask him to help them box, and even fight in next year’s Golden Gloves, Higgins has felt torn. He knows Patrick would want him to continue, and he reiterates how dark the park seemed when the gym was closed, but he still lives across the street from the Day family. It breaks his heart every time he sees Pat’s mother, knowing how much she hated boxing. How can he go on? Did boxing help him to deal with the torment of 9/11? “There’s no doubt,” Higgins says. “I was diagnosed with everything. But I was a high-profile fire guy, a marine. You don’t admit that stuff. I know it’s stupid and today I counsel people – ‘Go get help.’ But going for help made me feel worse. Coming here every day is what helped me. The gym is a family but I’m closest to Sean and Patrick. Sean came here a few months after 9/11 when I was still dazed. Remember, Seanie?” Monaghan nods. “You were in and out for a while …” “I wasn’t always here,” Higgins agrees, “but Seanie kept showing up. I could tell he was serious about boxing and that helped me.” Higgins smiles. “Then Patrick showed up. Seanie had such a positive impact on Pat because he is really kind. They sparred a thousand rounds together over the years. Patrick changed me too because I felt he would look at me differently if I got too angry and cursed. So I don’t curse no more. Seanie and Patrick were raised right, and they gave me a healing force with boxing.” Patrick did not need to be healed. He was happy and full of light and hope. “Pat had no intention of going pro,” Aristhene remembers. “But the longer he stayed in the game, and kept winning, the competitor in him said: ‘I need to face the best in the world.’” Did Patrick love boxing because it’s the ultimate test physically, emotionally and psychologically? “Exactly. That fact drew him in. In other sports you can shove the responsibility on to a team mate. But, with boxing, it’s all on you. You need discipline. You can’t be with your lady friends the way you want. You can’t eat the food you want. Early to bed. Wake up at dawn to run. That discipline is addictive.” I travel across Long Island to interview Lou DiBella, Day’s promoter, at home in Sea Cliff. DiBella, a Harvard Law School graduate, has been in boxing for over 30 years – but Day’s death shook him. Ten weeks since the tragic fight between two boxers he promoted, he still looks stricken. “I met Pat at the Golden Gloves,” DiBella recalls. “It was impossible not to notice him. He was a good-looking, eloquent kid with a big smile. Patrick was not your usual prize fighter. He didn’t have to do this.” From his pro debut in New York on 23 January 2013, Day won nine and drew one of his first 10 fights. Then, in January 2015, he faced Alantez Fox who was unbeaten in 14. Fox won a majority decision. “In my contracts, if a fighter loses, I can release him,” DiBella reveals. “It sounds cold, but it’s for the fighter’s good. Boxing is unforgiving and you can go from being a prospect to an opponent very quickly. People are hitting you in the head so it’s not healthy. “Fox was world-class but that fight could have gone either way. So I told him: ‘Pat, I’m keeping you on.’ He won the next two but then he fought a guy meant to be an ego‑boost in Brooklyn.” Carlos Garcia Hernandez, Day’s opponent in November 2015, had a mediocre record – nine wins, 14 losses and one draw. “The guy was a journeyman but he knocked Pat out. I thought Pat should get out of boxing. He had the charisma to be a very successful working person. Some fighters I would have kept on because if you take them out of boxing they get into drugs, criminal behaviour. Pat would never do that. I figured Pat could get a job so I released him.” That decision hurt Day and Higgins. “I was a little angry,” Higgins admits, “because Pat went for a quick knockout. In his previous fight he dropped the kid and I don’t know how he didn’t get counted out. The referee blew it. Pat still won every round. But afterwards DiBella criticised Pat, his own boxer. They made a comment like Patrick needs to hit harder. That offended Pat. Against the journeyman, he tried to knock the guy out right away. That’s never the gameplan. He learned a valuable lesson and in his remaining fights he stuck to our gameplan. He beat real competitive guys.” As the designated B-list opponent, meant to fall at the feet of the A-list prospect, Day shocked fighters with impressive records. From April 2016 to February 2019 he won six consecutive fights against supposedly superior rivals. DiBella had re-signed him after he beat the unbeaten Eric Walker in July 2017. “Lou had just signed Walker,” Higgins remembers, “but we knew we’d beat him.” DiBella acknowledges: “Pat and Joe didn’t quit. They won some big fights against top opposition. I had a new contract with Pat and I put him in fights that were tough but not like King Kong fights. He went on a long winning run. That made me realise: ‘I can get him another opportunity.’ “He came to see me before the Carlos Adames fight [in late June 2019]. His mother didn’t want him to fight. His parents are highly educated. This is not a family of under-achievers struggling against poverty. Pat was a kid any father would want his daughter to come home with. He said to me: ‘I’m making $10,000 a fight. I can’t justify this to my family. You’ve got to get me bigger fights.’ I wasn’t making much money with him but I believed in him as a person. His character was impeccable. When you have that combination of character, heart and you’re good, you can go a long way. So we got him Adames.” Adames, a punishing fighter from the Dominican Republic, had a flawless 17-0 record – but Day would make $50,000 and believed he could win. “Pat boxed well against Adames,” Higgins says. “But the kid hurt him in the final round. I saw a picture of Pat after the fight. Their arms are around each other and they’re smiling. But Patrick’s face is busted up.” DiBella recalls: “Pat fought brilliantly. Two-thirds of the way through, it was anybody’s fight. Adames wore Pat down but it was highly competitive. It was on ESPN and afterwards Pat was very positive. Sometimes you lose and it’s solitary. But everyone was taking pictures and telling him how well he fought. I told him I wasn’t going to release him. Pat’s message was the same: ‘I don’t want a meaningless fight. I want another opportunity.’” Higgins believed “It could have been a draw”, adding: “Brad Goodman, the Top Rank matchmaker, felt that. Pat wasn’t his guy but they all loved Patrick. Brad thought Pat could beat Charles Conwell. He felt Conwell wasn’t as good as Adames.” Aristhene was less certain. “I saw Conwell at the 2015 Golden Gloves. He fought Cordell Booker, who’s now an undefeated professional from New York. He beat Booker convincingly. I remember telling Pat that ‘Conwell is really tough’. But Pat and myself still thought it was winnable.” Seanie’s wife, was more worried. “I was walking around town with Beverly that Saturday,” Seanie remembers, “and we saw the wife of Joe Quiambao who used to be DiBella’s matchmaker. She and my wife have a bond, and they loved Patrick. They were like: ‘Oh, no, Pat’s fighting another fricken beast.’” In Chicago, Day had charmed the final press conference. He praised Chicago and the other fighters. He hoped everyone would stay “healthy and in one piece”. Day then said: “People look at me and say, ‘Oh, you’re such a nice guy, well-spoken, why do you choose to box?’ But I have a fighter’s soul and I love this sport. Boxing makes me happy. That’s why I choose to do it. That’s why we’re going to go out there on Saturday and have fun.” Higgins smiles. “If anyone was thinking of talking smack they decided right after Patrick spoke that ‘I’m not doing it’. He humbled the entire room. He made everybody love each other.” Few people loved him as much as his best friend. Aristhene, still reeling from his ominous dream the night before, felt sick. “In my dream the bad knockout happened in the third round. So once the fight passed round three, I felt calmer, like maybe this dream won’t come true. And then, in the 10th, it happened. I hated that. “I’ve seen guys knocked out, and put on a stretcher, but they wake up. Look at Curtis Stevens against David Lemieux. He was on a stretcher, but he put his hand up and was OK. Manny Pacquiao got put to sleep pretty hard, but I’m thinking: ‘He woke up. He was OK.’ It’s not usually the guys knocked out cold who suffer damage. It’s usually the guys beaten up round after round. Pat got dropped twice earlier but the first one he was off-balance. The second was a rough one, but he was OK. The last one was so abrupt and his head hit the canvas so hard. But it wasn’t until they said he didn’t wake up that I knew it was bad. I flew to Chicago.” Monaghan still can’t quite believe his friend is gone. “Coach called me from hospital. He says: ‘It’s not good, man. He won’t wake up.’ It was horrible. I thought, ‘Pat’s career is over but he’s a good kid and will do something else now.’ I was sad for Pat because he loved boxing. I never thought …” Monaghan looks up. “DiBella called me at midnight. He was freaking out: ‘Sean, the doctors say he might not make it.’ I told my wife and she gasped. Every time I spoke to Joe, there was no good news. The third Day brother was flying in from Texas. They were waiting for him and then they would switch off the machines. It makes me sick thinking about it.” Heather Hardy , a fellow New York fighter, was also hit hard by Day’s death. On 18 October Hardy tweeted: “For 12 hours our timelines were flooded with love and prayers for Patrick Day. Now most of that is gone. I refuse to forget, or allow anyone to forget his death. I’m losing sleep … not because Pat was so close to me … but because he was me. I am him. Don’t forget him.” I interview Hardy in Gleason’s, the famous old gym that lies in the shadow of Brooklyn bridge, and her face is lined with sweat after sparring. Hardy believes that the business of boxing, rather than the actual sport, cost Day his life. What does she mean? “An A-sided fighter is the favourite. You’re the promoter’s fighter. The B-side fighter is the guy who’s not supposed to win. The only time a B-side fighter ever really wins a fight, is when they knock the A-side fighter out. I felt like I am Pat because I also went into my last fight [against Amanda Serrano] as the B-side fighter. I felt the only way I was going to win was if I knocked her out. “It made me lose respect for how boxing treats its combatants. Patrick was just treated as somebody to make money for everybody. A stepping stone. But he was a great person. I met him in the amateurs. I believe we were on the national team together. But I was also a matchmaker at Gleason’s so I matched fights for him. I was about 29 and Pat would have been 18. But I can’t claim we were close friends. We were just fighters together. It’s different with Seanie Monaghan and Pat. They were like brothers.” I ask Monaghan when he last saw his friend. His crumpled face brightens as he remembers Patrick dancing in a Long Beach bar. “He was dressed so nice, dancing with this white girl. He turns round and gives me the biggest smile and sweatiest hug. He was a sweetheart.” The last time the two Patricks went out they also ended up dancing in Rockville. “We were sitting around and I said: ‘I feel like dancing,’” Aristhene recalls. “We went to this place we liked and met two beautiful girls. We danced with them and had a great night. There was no drinking. Just dancing and good conversation. After that we went home. We live on the same block so Pat dropped me off at the corner.” Aristhene drives me back to the gym in Freeport. I tell him how Higgins had said he would miss Patrick more than ever on Christmas morning. “We live across the street from the Days and Pat and I had this Christmas tradition,” the trainer said. “We would meet in the middle of the street and I’d get my Christmas morning hug from Pat. It’s going to be hard on Christmas Day. I won’t hug Pat Day.” New Year will be harder for Aristhene. He and Pat always spent New Year’s Eve together. “I’m going to be with his brothers this time,” Aristhene says. “We’ll remember Pat.” Walking through the park to the gym, we feel better. The Day family and Aristhene are setting up a Patrick Day scholarship which will be supported by DiBella – with further contributions from Dazn, the sports streaming service, and Eddie Hearn, who promoted his last fight, and other boxing insiders. “Education is everything to his family and we want to continue Pat’s legacy,” DiBella said. “What happened is heartbreaking but we can feel Pat’s impact. More has been written about health and safety in boxing the last few months than in a long time. There’ll be a kid going to college every year because of Pat. His name will live on.” Those closest to him are badly wounded. Aristhene stresses that Pat’s mother, “who is like a second mom to me”, is “such a good person. But it’s so hard for her. There have also been days when I could hardly get up. If I was not a schoolteacher I would have quit my job. But knowing I had kids to help got me up. Pat came to the school last year and spoke to the kids. They loved him. Everything we’re doing in his name gives me positivity because, all our 27 years, he was my best friend, my brother. I had him the whole ride. So, when he passed, I had no regrets. That’s freeing.” Inside the gym we see old photographs of Patrick boxing and smiling. We see his fight robe and his locker with his name scrawled above it. We see the ring where he and Seanie Monaghan sparred their thousand rounds. We see the corner where Joe Higgins used to wipe sweat from Patrick’s face while teaching him to become an even better fighter. How does Aristhene feel about boxing now? “Very mixed. Boxing changed me for the better. Winning the Golden Gloves is one of my highest honours. It gave me discipline and clarity. But it’s hard for me to tell people to box now because of what happened. Boxing did a lot for Pat but it took his life. He died doing something he loved. When I’m shadow-boxing in the ring I feel good. I feel close to Pat. But then I have waves of frustration, anger, sadness at the gravity of it. Sometimes I throw punches and watch myself in the mirror. These are the movements that took his life but I know he submitted his soul to boxing. “I had another dream about Pat the other night. I shave my head now. So when people touch my head it feels different. I felt Pat touch my head. In the dream I said: ‘What is it like?’ He said: ‘It’s nice. It’s chill with an all-knowing feeling.’ I found peace in that.” We drive through Freeport one last time and, after all the tumult and grief, I sense that peace. I remember how, as we left the gym, Aristhene reached out and touched Pat’s locker. It was his way of saying goodbye – and a reminder that he will be back. At Freepoint station we embrace like Coach Joe and Pat Day. “We’ll make sure his name and his legacy live on,” Aristhene says with certainty. “Patrick Day will never be forgotten.”"
"UK Sport is to cut funding from so-called posh sports – including equestrianism, sailing and rowing – for the next Olympic cycle as part of its plans to start helping a more diverse range of sports. While basketball, surfing and skateboarding will all receive £1.3m of funding as part of new “progression investments” in the buildup to the Paris 2024 Olympics – along with table tennis, weightlifting, climbing and fencing – sports seen as being played more by public schools are being asked to take a stiffer haircut. Canoeing’s funding has been cut from £16.3m to £12.1m, while rowing has dropped from £24.6m to £22.2m. Equestrianism (down to £11.1m), modern pentathlon and sailing (£21.3m) will also receive around a million pounds less to prepare for Paris 2024. The UK Sport chief executive, Sally Munday, agreed that part of the change in emphasis was an attempt to level things out between traditional public school sports, such as rowing, to ones that inner-city kids are more likely to take part in, such as skateboarding. “We’re really clear that what we are aiming to do is have teams at the Olympics and Paralympic Games that represent our society,” she said. However, PentathlonGB immediately vowed to appeal after its funding was cut from £5.5m to £4.4m. A statement said: “We recognise that, particularly in the current climate, difficult decisions have to be made, but the decision has left us perplexed about the lack of parity there seems to be across the sports receiving this crucial funding.” Asked whether UK Sport wanted working-class inner-city areas to be better covered, Munday replied: “Yes, that has played a part. You look at some of the sports that are now in our progression stream. You look at the likes of basketball, you look at skateboarding – these are sports that are probably going to bring new people into the Olympic and Paralympic family. And I think that’s really exciting.” UK Sport has been given £352m to invest in sports for the Paris 2024 Olympic cycle, up £7m from that allocated for Tokyo. It said that 36 sports, more than ever before, would receive “world-class programme” funding, while seven newer sports would get “progression investments” to support long-term medal prospects. However, because UK Sport was now funding more sports, Munday conceded that some would have to lose out. “Clearly there are sports that have taken some slightly bigger cuts than others,” she added. “Some of them might not have been expecting it as much as others and they’ll now look at how they cut their cloth accordingly. But everybody recognises the times that we’re in. Funding is a privilege, it’s not a right.” UK Sport said that another new strand in its new strategy was to try to win medals “the right way” in future following repeated allegations of a “culture of fear” across the sporting ecosystem in recent years, including at British Cycling and British Gymnastics. “There is no room in our system for people who do not want to do things the right way,” said Munday. “Bad people will try and infiltrate and be part of our system. We don’t want them. We will be asking everyone in the system to be working with us to get rid of people if they’re not going to behave in a way that aligns with the Olympic and Paralympic values. And if that requires us to remove money from sports, then that is what we will do.” Munday said UK Sport would also be beefing up its integrity unit and would draw up a new integrity strategy next year. She said the organisation wanted to be “very clear on where the line is, and we’ll be consulting on that in the new year”. Meanwhile the UK Sport chair, Katherine Grainger, refused to be drawn on whether the change in approach marked the end of UK Sport’s “no compromise” ethos, in which only sports with a realistic chance of medals received funding. “It’s still going to be about winning,” she stressed. “The British public have told us that they want us to keep winning. But it will really focus on how we win on the global stage, and I want our sporting community to be known internationally for its people-first approach, and also known for upholding the highest standards of integrity.” There were also big wins for badminton, wheelchair rugby and archery, which were all put back on funding, having been taken off in 2016."
"Ahhh, midwinter Test matches. For cricket-lovers around the world keeping a sleepy eye on Australia’s showdown with India, there’s nothing quite like the warm feeling of waking up to an Aussie batting collapse. It can be rather ruined when swiftly followed by the icy feeling of waking up to an Indian batting catastrophe. But that makes it all the better when India bounce back to pull off a famous victory masterminded by a stand-in captain. The last week in December is the peak of the cricket year, even if the only tests involving England this time are of the medical variety. It’s also the moment to look ahead and work out what we would like to see in 2021. So here are The Spin’s wishes, some realistic, others merely hopeful – but then, as the Guardian likes to say, hope is power. 1) The gates are opened Cricket can manage better without fans than many sports – it has had plenty of practice. But an empty ground is still a crying shame, and as the Premier League has shown, even a distanced crowd can drum up an atmosphere. This is one facet of the pandemic where the British government has erred on the side of caution. In hindsight, it would have been perfectly fine to build on the experiments of midsummer, rather than abruptly giving up on them. A couple of thousand people could have safely trickled in to watch each day of England’s matches at the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford. Let’s hope the relevant minister, Oliver Dowden, noticed that the MCG in Melbourne has just lifted its attendance back up to 30,000, or about one-third capacity. There is plenty of time to iron out the details: England’s home summer is due to begin on 29 June, almost as late as last year, and the first Test is not until 4 August. There’s even time for Dowden to be replaced by someone who actually has a passion for culture and sport. It’s baffling that Boris Johnson has yet to hand the culture brief to Jesse Norman, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who a) writes books, b) plays the trumpet, c) supports Manchester United and d) loves cricket. 2) New Zealand go top of the world If you asked a fan to name the world’s top-ranked Test team, they would almost certainly say Australia or India. The latest ICC rankings, issued on 14 December, have Australia top by a whisker. But it’s not India who are breathing down their necks – it’s New Zealand, the quiet achievers of international cricket. By the time their current series are over, any of the three could come out on top. If New Zealand win both their home Tests against Pakistan, it will take a 3-1 win by either Australia or India to keep them from the summit. Cinderella is at the ball: the only question is how long she is staying. 3) Crawley does it again It’s a great achievement to make a Test hundred for England, and in 143 years, only 171 men and 21 women have discovered what it feels like. The latest of them is Zak Crawley, aged 22, with that fabulous innings of 267 against Pakistan. As he gazes out from his flat at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, there’s just one small cloud in the sky. Of the 170 Englishmen to make a Test hundred before him, 60 never added a second. The One Ton Club includes two players with their name on a stand at Lord’s (Plum Warner and Gubby Allen); several other England captains (Douglas Jardine, George Mann, JWHT Douglas, Tony Lewis); a sprinkling of commentators (Trevor Bailey, David Lloyd, Nick Knight); a man whose first Test hundred was even bigger than Crawley’s (Tip Foster, who made 287 in Sydney on his Test debut); a couple of cult figures (Gilbert Jessop, David Steele); three of Crawley’s recent teammates (Ollie Pope, Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad); another of his fellow tourists this winter (Ben Foakes); and his mentor, Rob Key, who stroked 221 against West Indies at Lord’s but never reached that second fine careless rapture. Crawley hasn’t had much practice making hundreds – the 267 was only his fifth in first-class cricket – but he has the talent and the temperament to stop his magnum opus turning into a millstone. 4) Wood gets a go Bowlers need landmarks too. Mark Wood waited nearly four years for his first England five-fer, added another a year later, and then hit the buffers. His problem hasn’t been bowling badly, it has been getting on the field. Since his blazing breakthrough in St Lucia, Wood has played only three Tests – two in South Africa that went swimmingly and one in Southampton that gave West Indies a measure of revenge. By the end of this year, he was even missing from the white-ball side, squeezed out by the Curran brothers. After spending far too long with the physio, Wood is now having to deal with a different kind of frustration, living in the bubble and carrying the drinks. The Spin is not just concerned because Wood is a great character and a magnificent sight when in full flow. Come next winter’s Ashes, England are going to need all the firepower they can get, assuming Steve Smith remembers how to reach double figures. Of England’s many talented seamers, Wood is the only one who gets dramatically better when he steps on a plane: his average in overseas Tests is under 21, while at home it’s nearly 45. On 11 January, he turns 31. Three days later, all being well, England face Sri Lanka in Galle, and with Jofra Archer resting, Wood’s is the first name we will be looking for on the team sheet. 5) Holding has a bestseller Cricket’s most moving moment in 2020 was when Michael Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent bared their souls on Sky and talked about facing racism. Coming from Holding, who has been so self-contained as a commentator, it was like the moment when David Attenborough finally spoke out about the state of the climate – his dignity, and seniority, lent even greater weight to his dismay. Holding is writing a book called Why We Kneel, How We Rise. His agent is Charlotte Atyeo, who used to be at Bloomsbury working on Wisden, and his publisher is Ian Marshall of Simon &amp; Schuster, the man behind the Playfair Cricket Annual. There have been several bestsellers about race, but none of them has homed in on sport. It would be great if Holding changed that. 6) Ireland manage to keep busy For Ireland’s cricketers, 2020 started promisingly, with nine white-ball games in 10 weeks. Touring West Indies in January, they bounced back from a 3-0 drubbing in the ODIs to draw the T20 series 1-1. As the thwack of leather on willow gave way to stadium gates slamming shut, they squeezed in three T20 games against Afghanistan in India – losing the first two and tying the last after winning the Super Over. When cricket resumed in July, they led the way by touring England. True to form, they lost the first two ODIs before winning the third in style – the first time they had ever beaten England on English soil. Their problem is that as the pandemic drags on, the bigger fish will bend over backwards to face each other and may well forget about the minnows. Ireland should be back in action next week, when they play the first of seven ODIs in UAE – four against their hosts, followed by three against Afghanistan. After that, their diary is as blank as yours or mine. A glance at the ICC’s timetable of Future Tours from 2018 suggests the pandemic has already cost Ireland five Tests, which is a high price to pay when you have played only three in your history. • This is an extract taken from The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

"In Alabama, “Roll Tide!” is a phrase for all seasons. Love for the University of Alabama’s football powerhouse runs so deep in the southeastern state that the iconic college chant routinely doubles as shorthand for “hello”, “goodbye” and everything in between. But it may also have forgotten Confederate origins. The history of the phrase, as well as the creation myth behind the Crimson Tide’s nickname, is murky at best. There’s some circumstantial evidence to suggest that it was adapted from an old sea shanty called “Roll Alabama Roll”. It’s a late 19th-century song – an elegy of sorts – that mourns the sinking of the Alabama, a Confederate raiding ship, by the Union warship Kearsarge. That one-on-one skirmish is the most famous naval battle in Civil War history and is immortalized in a French impressionist Manet painting. Is it just a coincidence that the university’s fight song “Yea Alabama” calls for “Dixie’s football pride” to send Georgia Tech’s Yellow Jackets “to a watery grave?” Does the “Roll Tide Roll” rallying cry come from “Roll Alabama Roll?” Yes, according to the Alabama Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. They’re the century-old nonprofit group responsible for funding the construction of hundreds of Confederate memorials all over the south. “Roll Alabama Roll” definitely inspired “Roll Tide”, says Joe Ringhoffer, a former commander of the Semmes Camp 11 of the SCV. University of Alabama history professor John Beeler says he isn’t aware of a direct correlation, but he wouldn’t be surprised if it were true. At a time when Black Lives Matter protests have sparked a scrubbing or contextualizing of campuses’ Confederate iconography, many universities south of the Mason-Dixon line are now grappling with school traditions more subtle than larger-than-life Robert E Lee statues or “stars-and-bars” rebel flags. Two generations ago, Confederate battle flags flew free in the stands of Southeastern Conference games and marching bands proudly played “Dixie” – the Confederacy’s unofficial anthem. That’s no longer the case. But universities are now discovering that even seemingly innocuous fight songs and fan-friendly chants aren’t safe from their problematic histories. In June, the University of Florida banned its “Gator Bait” cheer at home games. Historians say black children were used as bait to lure alligators in the 19th century, and the term “alligator bait” was also used as a racial slur. Some Florida tourist spots even sold postcards depicting African-Americans being attacked by alligators. UF school president Kent Fuchs explained the ban by noting the “horrific historic racist imagery associated with the phrase”. Some Gator fans have protested the decision to discontinue the tradition, saying that there’s nothing racist about the chant. In the GOP primary earlier this year, Judson Sapp, a Florida Republican who lost a 10-way race to replace representative Ted Yoho, even campaigned on rescuing Gator Bait. The University of Texas also made headlines this fall after the Longhorn marching band opted not to play its fight song “The Eyes of Texas'’ at a game against Baylor. The decision came months after Texas athletes marched along with football coach Tom Herman from the campus to the state’s capitol building in Austin in the days following the killing of George Floyd. A group of student protesters called on UT to drop the song because of its “racist overtones”. The tune – sung to the sounds of “I’ve Been Workin’ on the Railroad” – was originally performed at minstrel shows by white performers in blackface and was inspired by a quote from Confederate general Robert E Lee. The school tweaked its rules to find a middle ground between activist students and older alum and donors, ruling that players had to stand during performances of “The Eyes of Texas” but were no longer forced to sing it. But it didn’t work. After a four-overtime loss to Oklahoma in October, only Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger remained on the field during the song. Richard Reddick, UT’s associate dean for equity, community engagement and outreach, is currently leading a committee tasked with figuring out how to keep the school’s 117-year-old song “but with a more complete accounting and acknowledgment of its past”. It won’t be easy. Reckoning with history has been especially messy for Southern college football programs due to its symbolic role in the former slave states since Reconstruction. The scions of the planter class embraced the game as a way to reassert the Old South’s proclaimed values of masculinity and chivalry. As a result, many Southern college football programs selected uniforms, nicknames and rituals that evoked Confederate militarism. For instance, Louisiana State University chose the nickname “Fighting Tigers'’ in dedication towards a rebel Civil War regiment known as the Louisiana Tigers. Auburn used to wave ‘The Bonnie Blue Flag’ during games and the University of Virginia initially chose silver grey and cardinal red as their team colors “to represent the glory of the Confederacy, dyed in the blood of the fallen”. As the sport grew in popularity, and cross-regional matchups between segregated southern and integrated northern schools played, bowl games became perceived as proxy battles for the Civil War. The University of Alabama’s 1926 Rose Bowl victory over the University of Washington was treated as a win for the Old South as a whole. “We were the South’s baby. We felt like the Rose Bowl was more than just another football game,” said Hoyt Winslett, Alabama’s first All-American, after the game. That championship inspired “Yea Alabama”, the school’s new fight song, and lyrics such as “Hit your stride, you’re Dixie’s Football Pride”, that hint at the team’s greater symbolic significance. Following Alabama’s tie with Stanford in the Rose Bowl the following year, university president George Denny said: “I come back with my head held a little higher and my soul a little more inspired to win this battle for the splendid Anglo-Saxon race of the South.” Confederate symbols at college football games hit a new inflection point during the mid-20th century in protest of integration policies – especially after the landmark Brown v Board of Education Supreme Court decision. For instance, in the 1962 Gator Bowl against Penn State, Florida’s coach ordered a Confederate battle flag patch placed on the team uniforms and replaced the Gators’ traditional numbers on the helmets with the rebel flag. A year later, Alabama governor George Wallace notoriously threw himself in a doorway to protest University of Alabama’s first Black students’ enrollment. In 1967, his wife, Governor Lurleen Wallace, issued an executive order for the University of Alabama to play “Dixie” and to display the Confederate flag at all home football games. “It wasn’t accidental; it was southern institutions saying, ‘We oppose the Civil Rights Movement. Let’s reify this white past and show these Confederate artifacts as objects of devotion,’” says Timothy Lombardo, an assistant history professor at the University of South Alabama. Change has been slow and steady for much of the past 50 years. The Crimson Tide first desegregated in 1970. The NCAA and the SEC have banned Confederate battle flags and the playing of “Dixie” from football stadiums. Overt symbols like Colonel Reb, the goateed caricature of an old, white plantation owner that danced on the sidelines of Ole Miss games earlier this century, is gone as well. Now in 2020, with statues falling left and right, it’s the more granular symbols getting attention. “For so long, these things were lost in the background but I think what’s happened is that they have been brought to the foreground of our consciousness,” says Connor Towne O’Neill, an English teacher at Auburn and the author of That Devil’s Bones: A Reckoning with Monuments, Memory, and the Legacy of White Supremacy It’s not inconceivable then that the Crimson Tide’s seemingly 94-year-old fight song and omnipresent “Roll Tide” will make the list in the near future."
"Sam Warburton argued this month a high-risk approach did not work in professional rugby because defences were so good. The former Wales and Lions captain said that moving the ball in your own half rarely yielded any reward which is why there was so much kicking. Here Bristol proved him right and wrong, clumsy, clueless and careless for 39 minutes and unstoppable for the next 41 as they climbed to second in the table. Aside from the depressing reality of what Warburton was saying about defence counting for more than attack, imagine Barcelona in Messi’s heyday dropping the Argentinian, while Xavi and Iniesta claim the long-ball game is more productive; Bristol are a team prepared to pass where others kick. The tactic laid down by the Bristol head coach, Pat Lam, has helped them escape from the Championship and reach the Champions Cup and it may have seemed a good idea anyway against a side that had lost their last four home matches in all competitions while winning five in a row away in the Premiership. Quins’ defence has had a seasonal generosity but here, knowing what to expect, they were ready. And so, with one minute of the first half remaining, Harlequins led 9-0, two of their three penalties coming when Bristol had been caught in possession in their own half, doubting their Thomases, Dan and Yann, who both turned attack into three points for Marcus Smith. The Bears may have had the ball, but Quins had the lead. Bristol stuck at it, even when Semi Radradra, making his first appearance of the season, dropped a couple of passes and threw another forward. Quins let out jubilant howls every time they thwarted an attack, most notably when Will Evans foiled a blindside raid by Harry Randall and Callum Sheedy following a lineout. Their persistence delivered with the final move of the opening period. Dan Thomas slipped a short pass to Steven Luatua after Radradra had stormed the gainline and moved outside his captain to receive the ball back and finish from 25 metres with the defence for once caught out. Bristol should have scored after three minutes when Nathan Hughes had space to run into at the side of a ruck but he was slow into his stride and Evans and Alex Dombrandt, who led by example before being taken off after 55 minutes, held him up over the line. Otherwise the chances went to Quins, largely through their opportunism after turnovers. Smith’s dink on halfway was caught by Ben Tapuai but what would have been a scoring pass for Ross Chisholm turned into an intercept for the lurking Siva Naulago and when Wilco Louw made it over the line, the referee, Matt Carley, declared he had been held up by Dan Thomas and Hughes, a decision the television match official, Wayne Barnes, upheld because there was no evidence of the ball being grounded despite the prop’s protestations. A few words from Lam at the break made all the difference. Bristol still ran from their own half but also played for territory. Harlequins no longer had isolated ball-carriers to milk and found it far more testing to keep Bristol behind the gainline. If the home side’s defence had improved, their discipline had not and the eighth penalty they conceded cost them. Harry Randall took it quickly 10 metres out and Luatua finished off before Randall scored himself after Hughes took Smith for a ride as the fly-half clung on after an attempted tackle. Smith had earlier equalised with his fourth penalty before Sheedy replied from 40 metres, but it was Quins who were now running from their own half and making mistakes after struggling to find a way through. Bristol scented a bonus point and it arrived 14 minutes from time when Luatua’s slick pass freed the replacement wing Niyi Adeolokun who showed instant acceleration before stepping inside Mike Brown. Quins did score a try through Smith, but it came too late with the last move of the match and their one solace was the impact in defence and attack of the wing Louis Lynagh who was making his Premiership debut. It was Bristol’s first league win here since 2001. “I told the players at half-time they had a choice of two doors,” said Lam. “The one on to the coach or the one back on to the field. We were woeful in the first half, too individual and the worst I have seen us. The mindset changed and it was a good lesson for us.”"
"It is hard to recall a stronger renewal of Monday’s Savills Chase, the feature event of the Leopardstown Christmas Festival, and the fact that Samcro, a Grade One winner at Cheltenham back in March, is a double-figure price is an indicator of the strength in depth. Kemboy and Delta Work, the winners in 2018 and 2019, are both back for another crack, while Presenting Percy is another contender with plenty of form in open Grade One company and returned to something like his best at Thurles last time. The rising star in the field, though, is Minella Indo (2.25), who was overhauled by Champ in the shadow of the post in the RSA Chase in March and is making only the sixth chase start of his career. He has two easy wins to his credit already this season and Monday’s race could further enhance his claim to be Ireland’s leading hope for the Gold Cup in March. Leopardstown 1.15 Sire Du Berlais is one of just three contenders in a nine-strong field making their Grade One debut over jumps, but the form of his wins under a big weight in the Pertemps Final at Cheltenham in 2019 and 2020 makes him the one to beat. Fury Road, third in last season’s Albert Bartlett, is progressive but still has plenty to find with the favourite on his latest Grade Two-winning form at Punchestown. Catterick 1.30 Several interesting types in a competitive handicap hurdle, including The Russian Doyen, back over hurdles on a fair mark after two sub-par runs over fences. Preference though is for Phil Kirby’s Lord Torranaga (nap), whose opening mark of 124 looks very fair after a solid run behind a subsequent winner at Sedgefield last time. Leopardstown 1.50 It has been a busy year already for Rapid Response, with two starts over hurdles followed by seven more over fences, but she returns to timber after a near two-month break on a decent mark and looks like the most reliable proposition in a field where several opponents lack her consistency. Catterick 2.00 Sashenka was a fair performer on the Flat and can build on the promise she showed on her hurdling debut at Wincanton last month. Limerick 2.45 As tricky as they come, but the top weight Articulum showed enough on his return to action at Navan earlier this month to suggest that a bigger run is just around the corner. Leopardstown 3.00 The future Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere is among the top-notch chasers to have taken this Beginners’ Chase in the past and while The Big Getaway could not live up to a tall reputation on his chasing debut at Navan earlier this month, this looks like a good chance to get his fencing career back on track. Catterick 3.07 Maison D’Or rarely runs a bad race at this track and has an excellent opportunity to get a second win over course and distance on his record."
"I do not care how many sports you add to the Olympics. Breakdancing sounds like fun. Sport climbing will also be great, as soon as I work out what that is. But there is a recurring theme whenever the Games roster is changed that we have to address. That is the suggestion – joking or otherwise – that equestrian should be dropped. This is not entirely academic. Earlier this year there was a risk Australia would not be able to field an equestrian team in Tokyo 2021. Equestrian Australia went into voluntary administration after Sport Australia pulled funding, citing governance concerns. It has since overhauled its constitution, installed new directors and new management, and got the Olympic program back on track. Australian sport fans should be relieved. Not just because equestrian has helped Australia out on the medal tally, although it undoubtedly has, but because the Olympics is not really about sport. It is about narratives. It is about using the actions of some gifted individuals to weave (frequently apocryphal) myths about national character. Those myths usually hinge around the courage of the athletes. And nowhere in the summer Olympics is courage more required than the in the three-day event. Outside of the Paralympics, where we have a number of successful riders, Australia has only really been competitive in the three-day event. That’s the one where horse and rider do dressage on day one, endurance and a cross country course on day two and showjumping on day three. It began with Australia’s first gold medal for equestrian at Rome in 1960, when Bill Roycroft completed the showjumping round with a broken shoulder and a dislocated collarbone after coming off in the cross country. The best bit of Olympic myth-making came in Atlanta in 1996. On the team was the youngest-ever rider to represent Australia, 21-year-old Wendy Schaeffer on her pony club horse. She had broken her leg in a fall in training two months earlier. Riders walk through the cross country course before they have to ride it, to work out their strategy. Because of her leg, Schaeffer was being driven about by a golf buggy until the US team complained, saying if she was not fit to walk she was not fit to ride. She got out and walked, bleeding through her socks. Schaeffer finishedf at the top of the table. If the rules had not changed after Barcelona, she would be a dual gold medallist just like Matt Ryan was in 1992. But hers is not the ride people remember. Gillian Rolton and Peppermint Grove, known as Fred, had been part of the gold medal-winning team in 1992 and were a late inclusion in 1996 because Ryan’s horse pulled up lame. About halfway in Fred slipped on a patch of muddy ground. Rolton broke her collarbone and several ribs in the fall but if she had withdrawn, the team’s medal chances would have been lost. So she kept riding. She fell at the next fence and got back on, finishing the course one-handed. Andrew Hoy and Darien Powers made up the points. By the showjumping round the next day Rolton, who had refused painkillers in hospital in case she had to ride, was done in. It didn’t matter: Australia was so far ahead that the final rider on the team, Philip Dutton, could have dropped every rail in the showjumping and they still would have won. The team finished 57 points ahead of the Americans and Rolton wore a sling on the winner’s podium. That is enough sporty mythos for a Lifetime movie. That is what you want from the Olympics. A saga. A show of courage. A very real sense of danger – so real that the rules were later changed so that riders could not ride on after a fall. I watched it standing in front of the television, too excited to sit on the couch. Rolton, who sadly lost her battle with cancer in 2017, was my hero. Granted, I was a horsey kid. Dressage, mainly, but I will not go in to bat for dressage as a universally watchable spectator sport. Eventing, however, is fun and comes with the joy of hearing the excellent and extremely posh commentator, Lucinda Green, say things like “he was going to take it straight and bold”. It does not matter that almost no one has direct experience with equestrian sports. If anything, it enhances viewer experience because it prompts the commentators to explain the rules so there is not the same barrier of assumed knowledge that can be off-putting when watching more popular but equally esoteric sports, such as cricket. There are genuine criticisms of equestrian, mostly concerning horse and rider safety and inhumane training methods still used by some riders. No riders have died competing in the games but the sport is facing a reckoning in Australian and elsewhere over rider deaths and safety issues at lower levels. Equestrian is also very expensive and overwhelmingly white. These are all problems that can and should be addressed. The Olympic spotlight could help push some of those changes along. While it is doing so, we will be able to watch the best horses in the world jump over enormous fake hedges and down steep banks into shallow ponds, while Lucinda Green tells us that we are doing magnificently. That is what the Olympics is all about."
"Same date, same race, same trainer: the parallels with Sprinter Sacre’s shock defeat in the Desert Orchid Chase seven years ago were hard to ignore after Altior could finish only second behind the surprise 20-1 winner Nube Negra on his first start for 10 months here on Sunday. One difference, though, is that Sprinter Sacre’s problem was swiftly diagnosed as a fibrillating heart – serious, but treatable. The concern after Altior’s defeat, his second in 22 starts over jumps, is that time is catching up with him, which no amount of treatment can cure. Altior was an uneasy even-money favourite for a race he won at odds of 1-8 just two years ago, amid a winning sequence at the start of his jumping career which eventually stretched to 19 races. The first hint of vulnerability came early, as Nico de Boinville was forced to nudge him along to track the pace, and though he was staying on again at the finish, Nube Negra had cruised into the lead between the last two fences and Altior never threatened to lay a glove on a horse officially rated 20lb his inferior. Nicky Henderson, Altior’s trainer, had no immediate explanation for his stable star’s defeat. “He was a bit rusty, yes, but it’s not as if he blew the house down afterwards so I’m not going to blame it on that,” Henderson said. “He’s been all but a year off the racecourse and one has to mention this ghastly thing about the ground again. It doesn’t help him but to be fair Nico [de Boinville, his jockey] said he was never really taking him where he wanted to be and he shouldn’t be getting beaten by that level [of opponent]. “It was hard work but I take little plusses out of it. He did actually finish, he was going probably better at the end and at least he was running on, he didn’t stop. He just always seemed to be in top gear.” It took more than two years for Henderson to nurse Sprinter Sacre back to Grade One-winning form at 10 years of age on a memorable day at Cheltenham in March 2016. Altior, though, turns 11 on Friday and his trainer does not have nearly so much time on his side. “We will scope him but I don’t think there’s anything wrong there,” Henderson said. “We scoped him two days ago and he was as clean as a whistle. But let’s not write him off yet. Unless he definitely tells us enough is enough, we’ve not discussed it [retirement] and that’s the last thing on my mind that we would retire him. We sat through these sessions with Sprinter, and everyone wanted him retired, yet look what he gave us at the end, it was a day that none of us will ever forget.” Henderson cast his mind back, too, to the race on testing ground at Ascot last year that cost Altior his unbeaten record over fences, and possibly more besides. “It’s a little bit like Sprinter when he had his fibrillating heart here, when you get to that point where you sort of frighten a horse,” Henderson said. “It’s a bit like boiling a kettle without any water in it, it’s going to blow up and you can’t do anything about it, that’s the end of the kettle. “You always have to be fearful that when you’ve gone that low you never know what scar you’ve left on them. It was the same with Sprinter, it took a long time and a lot of building up. We haven’t got a lot of time at the moment, so we’ll have to see. He’s got to run again if he’s going to go to Cheltenham.” Ladbrokes pushed Altior out to 10-1 (from 6-1) for the Champion Chase in March while Chacun Pour Soi, an impressive winner of the two-mile Grade One at Leopardstown on Sunday, was cut to 5-4 (from 5-2). Altior was the second big name from the Henderson stable to suffer a defeat at Kempton’s Christmas Festival after Epatante, the Champion Hurdle winner last season, could finish only second at long odds-on in the Christmas Hurdle on Saturday. There was one very bright light for the yard at the meeting, however, as Shishkin, often seen as Altior’s natural successor in the top two-mile chases, brushed aside his field to win the Grade Two Wayward Lad Novice Chase. Altior took the same race in 2016 on the way to a short-odds victory in the Arkle Trophy the following March, and Shishkin too is now odds-on for the second race at the Festival meeting at a top price of 5-6."
"Adam Hughes At 30 years of age, Hughes is the youngest of the players to go public. His diagnosis is thus different: brain injuries and post-concussion syndrome, rather than dementia with probable CTE, but the neurologists have told him he is on the same path as the others. If so – and little is certain with the brain – it is only a matter of time. Hughes was a muscular, elusive utility back, whose preferred position was centre. He represented Wales throughout the age groups and made his debut for the Dragons, in Newport, the town of his birth, as a 20-year-old in 2010. He quickly established himself and was voted player of the year in his first full season. In 2014 he moved to Bristol mid-season, before signing a two-year deal with Exeter that summer. He was unable to establish himself at the Chiefs and returned to the Dragons, initially on loan, in October 2015. He retired because of his brain injuries in 2018, having played 119 times for them. His story, that of a rising star whose career started to falter, no doubt in part because of his concussions, is poignant, revealing much about the typical lot of a professional player. “For me, I think the biggest issue around concussions was attitude,” he says. “It was often treated like a weakness if you don’t dust yourself down and carry on. So naturally you see many players expert at just getting up and carrying on, regardless of how they feel. Ultimately, it’s their job, and no player wants to lose their job.” Hughes is now a financial advisor. He is unable to pursue his ambition to be a professional pilot, for which he had gained a licence. Motion sickness is one of his symptoms, which prevents him flying. He also referees and is quick to react when he sees a head injury but notes with alarm the occasional abuse from coaches when he sends a potentially concussed player from the field. Neil Spence Spence is at the other end of the spectrum from Hughes. At 44, he is the oldest of the initial plaintiffs. He is also the lowest profile, but as such his case is poignant too. How many more like him may there be? He played age-group rugby for England as an openside flanker, before spending his career at Leicester, Gloucester and Rotherham, making 32 Premiership appearances for the latter in seasons 2000-01 and 2003-04. He also played in France and represented Yorkshire, twice winning the county championship with them. He was an RFU community coach for nearly 10 years and now teaches PE and French in a secondary school. He describes symptoms of cognitive decline that date back to 2012. One early example saw him leave home to pick up his kids from nursery but drive on towards one of the schools he was coaching at to set up a session. As he did, it dawned on him no one was there. It was half-term. Only then did he remember he was meant to be picking up his children. Other typical symptoms include problems with his speech, confusion and uncertainty in the car and extreme mood swings. “I used to be the life and soul of the party,” he says, “but I feel that side of me is lost for ever.” The uncertainty of his prognosis also eats away at him. He speaks of relief at the diagnosis but great fear over the future. “My neurologist said I could get quite bad over the next 10 years or it could be a steady decline over the next 30. The thought of not seeing my children grow up, not seeing my grandchildren or walking my daughter down the aisle is somewhat unbearable.”"
"Kempton’s two-day Christmas Festival meeting, including the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day, has been forced to retreat behind closed doors following the announcement by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that Surrey will move to the highest tier of coronavirus restrictions from Saturday. The track had been hoping to welcome up to 2,000 spectators for the always hugely popular King George, around 20% of the normal attendance for the highlight of the Christmas racing programme, despite being obliged to tell fans from Greater London to stay away from the meeting after the capital also moved to tier 3 earlier this week. “We know that racing fans will be disappointed to be missing out on some thrilling live action over the Christmas period,” a spokesperson for Jockey Club Racecourses, Kempton’s owner, said on Thursday, “especially having only just been allowed to return to our venues in very limited numbers. “However, we recognise that we must all play our part in tackling this pandemic and look forward to welcoming racegoers back to our courses as soon as we’re able to do so.” The Challow Hurdle at Newbury on 29 December and the Tolworth Hurdle at Sandown on 2 January will also now take place behind closed doors. Both tracks would have hoped to accommodate 2,000 racegoers but will now begin the process of refunding all racegoers who had already bought tickets. Ascot, meanwhile, has decided that spectators will not be admitted for the first day of its December meeting on Friday, despite the local tier 3 restrictions for Berkshire not coming into force until the following day. “Ascot has consulted with Public Health England and its Safety Advisory Group,” the track said in a statement, “and the advice received is that it should not be open to the public tomorrow [Friday]. “Cases in the south of England have risen over 40% in the last week and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is now in a very high-risk area. Ascot is sorry that it has to deliver this news to people looking forward to coming racing this weekend.” Friday’s best bets, by Greg Wood ITV Racing’s occasional forays into the best of the Irish racing programme continue on Friday with the Grade Two novice hurdle at Navan, and an opportunity for many British fans to get their first look at Holymacapony (1.35). Henry de Bromhead’s gelding made a hugely impressive start under rules in a maiden hurdle at Punchestown last month, beating a well-touted prospect from the Willie Mullins yard by eight lengths in an exceptional time for a debutant. He shot straight to the top of the betting for the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham as a result, and while there are several promising sorts lined up against him, both the style and the time of his latest win make him an attractive proposition today at around 7-4. Ascot 1.20 Everglow is still looking for a first win over timber after two attempts, but Philip Hobbs thought enough of the five-year-old to set out at Grade Two level in the Persian War at Chepstow in October, and he progressed to finish second in a strong maiden hurdle next time. This is an ideal opportunity to get off the mark. Ascot 1.55 On the face of it, Flegmatik took a step backwards at Sandown last time following a winning debut over fences, beating just two of his six rivals home. He had no luck in running though, and a return to his earlier form would put him right in the mix at around 5-1. Ascot 2.30 A strong renewal of the Grade Two Kennel Gate, with even the 16-1 outsider, Press Your Luck, hard to rule out as he is 2-2 over hurdles so far. Llandinabo Lad brings the strongest form however, and is also the best on the clock, so 3-1 looks a fair price. Ascot 3.05 Another Grade Two, this time over fences, which has more depth than the small field might suggest. Fiddlerontheroof has long threatened to go right to the top as a chaser but the in-and-out form of the Colin Tizzard stable is a concern. Nicky Henderson sends Allart to make his chasing debut in Graded company, which could well be significant, but Pic D’Orhy was just as good over hurdles and can make the most of his previous experience over fences."
"Amid the cluster of young English fly‑halves coming to prominence this season, Toby Flood is still going strong at 35. He spends a bit less time on the training paddock – “Show ponies always need to be managed!” – but, adopting the mentoring role that Jonny Wilkinson fulfilled when Flood was breaking through at Kingston Park, he is leading Newcastle’s revival on and off the pitch. If it was a surprise to see him slog it out last season in the Championship in the twilight of his career, Flood is adamant that jumping ship never crossed his mind and, given Newcastle have accrued four wins from their first four league matches, it is paying dividends for the Falcons. A recent study showed that No 10s are the best-paid players in the Premiership but it is hard to put a value on Flood’s experience, comprising 60 England caps as well as three Premiership titles won at Leicester Tigers and a stint at Toulouse in between his two Newcastle spells. Just as Wilkinson was, Flood has often been deployed at inside-centre of late, allowing Brett Connon to flourish inside him. It is instructive to hear him cite another World Cup-winning playmaker in Mike Catt, who played domestically until 38, as an example of why retirement is still a long way over the horizon. “In my era, when I first came through, Mike Catt played for a long time, and he was in a similar position I find myself in; I’ve played a bit of 10, played a bit of 12,” says Flood. “Someone like that, you look at and think: ‘How did he keep going?’ You looked at him in how he managed himself off the field, in terms of what he ate, how he behaved, how he trained – and just the fact he was very mentally strong as well, and managed to deal with not training every couple of days if he had to.” Flood has spent large parts of his career being compared to Wilkinson but he does acknowledge the similarities in his role at Newcastle and the one England’s most celebrated No 10 played for him back in the mid-2000s. “Yeah – apart from Jonny was at his prime and pretty good. Two stark differences! “I was fortunate to come through an era where we had Jonny, Matt Burke, Jamie Noon, Dave Walder. They were huge in facilitating my development. The questions they asked: ‘Why did you do that? What did you see there?’ It was really nice in the sense that I had Burkey on one side, who was this Australian international who just glided through space, and Jonny, who was this studious player who just wanted to understand the game and get better and better. “Absolutely, Jonny helped me no end in terms of how I should hold myself on the field and off it. If I can add a tenth of the value that Jonny did to my game, then I’ll be leaving the club in a better place.” Newcastle’s 100% record so far this season is all the more impressive given they did not play a match for eight months, stuck in limbo as the promoted side from the curtailed Championship while last season’s Premiership was finished. It at least gave Dean Richards the chance to plot for the new campaign and he will not have forgotten how a dreadful start to the season two years ago ultimately proved too much to claw back. On Friday Flood comes back into the No 10 jersey as Newcastle’s unbeaten start is put to the test at Bristol but, with wins at Bath and Wasps already this season, the Falcons will fancy their chances of another upset. “Had you offered us this, we’d have bitten your hand off,” says Flood. “I can’t answer [if it was a surprise] any more articulately than just saying yes, because we hadn’t played for so long, the circumstance we found ourselves in was a difficult one. “We’d have taken two wins, maybe win both our home games. “The fact we played the first three games against sides who had finished in the top five the year before, it’s credit to us. There is a bit of surprise, but there is also a bit of enjoyment. Surprise is probably not the right word in terms of what you want to articulate from our camp. In terms of – we didn’t think we could do it or we are surprised we’ve got the ability. It’s none of that. It is just the surprise of the situation we found ourselves in, and then actually being able to manage it. We always believed we could win the games but ultimately you do surprise yourself when you’ve won a few games in the fashion you have.”"
"Six of the nine runners for the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day have at least one Grade One win to their name already and five are expected to start single-figure odds, so the 2021 running of Kempton Park’s showpiece event has fair claims to be not only the strongest renewal this century but also the most competitive. Two serious contenders from Ireland - including Minella Indo, last season’s Gold Cup winner – add to the depth in a race that has not crossed the water since Kicking King’s second win in 2005, and Rachael Blackmore’s mount is priced up alongside Clan Des Obeaux, the King George winner in 2018 and 2019, at around 3-1 as the market struggles to find an outright favourite. Frodon and Bryony Frost, who led all the way last year to win at 20-1, will go off at around 6-1 this time around, as will Chantry House, a dual Grade One winner as a novice last season. Asterion Forlonge, Saint Calvados and the mercurial Lostintranslation also arrive at Kempton with a chance on the pick of their form, so the only guarantee this year is that finding the winner on Sunday afternoon will be well worth the effort. Anyone who simply wants to back the best horse need look no further than Minella Indo, who is 3lb in front of Clan Des Obeaux on the official numbers and 5lb ahead according to the much-respected Timeform organisation. Finding the best bet in the race, however, is a different puzzle entirely, as Minella Indo’s best form has come at Cheltenham and he needed every yard of the extended three-and-a-quarter miles to get the better of A Plus Tard in the Gold Cup. Sunday’s race is a very different test, and while Blackmore has a rare talent for adapting her tactics to suit the situation at hand, Minella Indo was only fourth in the Irish Gold Cup over three miles in February and was a beaten favourite too – behind Frodon - on his seasonal debut at Down Royal in October. Henry de Bromhead’s chaser was fully entitled to need that run after a 225-day break but he still makes more appeal at 5-1 for the Gold Cup in March than he does for Sunday’s race at 3-1. Clan Des Obeaux is the opposite, a horse who is ideally suited to Sunday’s track and trip and highly unlikely even to get an entry in the Gold Cup. He is now almost 10, however, was below his best behind Frodon 12 months ago and has not seen a racecourse since Punchestown in April. Paul Nicholls has saddled a dozen King George winners and has no equals when it comes to getting a horse fit first time up, but a nine-year-old Clan Des Obeaux’s best may no longer be quite enough. Frodon and Frost were worthy winners last season and will again be very difficult to overhaul in the straight if they can settle into their usual rhythm. But they are unlikely to be allowed such an easy time of it in front and this also looks like a stronger race. The juice has been squeezed out of Chantry’s House’s odds in recent days and he has too much to find with the principals to be of any interest at around 5-1. As a result, the price that leaps out at the likely odds is the 7-1 about Asterion Forlonge (3.05). Willie Mullins’s seven-year-old made a slow start over fences, falling in two of his first three chase starts, but his 14-length win off 152 in a handicap at Punchestown in April was backed up by an excellent time and he looked a very likely winner when he unseated Bryan Cooper three out in a strong renewal of the John Durkan at the same track earlier this month. The grey’s jumping had been sound to that point, as it was when he won in the spring, and he also seems well suited to a right-handed track. He looks overpriced to give Mullins his second King George winner, 20 years on from his first win with Florida Pearl. Kempton Park 1.20 Jacamar is still winless after three starts over fences but has shown something to work on in all three. He was clear of two previous winners at Wincanton last time, has cheekpieces applied to help his concentration and looks too big as the outsider of the field at around 14-1. Kempton Park 1.55 A fascinating head-to-head in prospect between Ahoy Senor and Bravemansgame, the best staying novices of the season so far. At the likely odds, marginal preference is for Lucinda Russell’s six-year-old, who stormed 31 length clear of the runner-up at Newbury last time. Wetherby 2.10 Debece has shown glimmers of real class at times in a stop-start career and could be worth chancing first time up after a second wind op over the summer. Kempton Park 2.30 Not So Sleepy and Epatante dead-heated for the Fighting Fifth at Newcastle in November and there should be little to choose between them again here. Drying ground may just tip the balance towards Nicky Henderson’s mare."
"As recently as 2005, less than a year after saddling his fourth Grand National winner, the late trainer Ginger McCain, of Red Rum fame, made a confident prediction that a female jockey would never win the world’s most famous steeplechase. At the time, it had been a decade since a woman had even taken part and only two of the 15 female jockeys who had ridden in the National had managed to complete the race. Sixteen years later, when Rachael Blackmore crossed the Aintree finishing line on Minella Times in April, a landmark moment for the sport was, at the same time, no great surprise. That says a little about how swiftly attitudes can change, and a great deal about Blackmore’s exceptional talent for steering half-ton steeplechasers around jumping’s most demanding tracks as quickly and efficiently as possible. The ride on Minella Times was textbook Blackmore: perfectly positioned from the off, saving ground on the inner and in touch with the lead, and finding a great response from her horse as he jumped the unique Aintree fences for the first time. When Blackmore eased into the lead two out, it was already a case of not if but by how far. Blackmore has never really engaged with talk of glass ceilings or breakthroughs, preferring instead to be seen as a jump jockey who happens to be female. It was the same after her greatest triumph in April, as it had been at the Cheltenham Festival three weeks earlier when six winners, including Honeysuckle in the Champion Hurdle on the opening afternoon, meant she won the award for the meeting’s leading rider for the first time. Blackmore finished the week one short of Ruby Walsh’s record at one Festival and came within a length and a quarter of getting it in the Gold Cup, as her mount A Plus Tard finished second behind Minella Indo in a 1-2 for her main trainer, Henry de Bromhead. De Bromhead saddled six winners over the week, including a unique treble in the “Holy Trinity” of feature events: the Champion Hurdle, the Champion Chase and the Gold Cup. That he was still beaten to the top trainer prize by Willie Mullins tells the story of an unprecedented week for Irish racing, with 23 of the 28 winners. The memory is still raw for British jumping before a 2022 Festival when a similar humiliation would be unthinkable. It was a Festival that helped Irish jumping – and the sport as a whole – to move on from a shocking scandal in February, when a photograph emerged on social media showing Gordon Elliott, one of the country’s leading trainers, posing on a dead horse on his gallops. If Blackmore’s victory at Aintree was the defining image of 2021 on the racecourse, then the Elliott photo was the abiding image away from the track. He was banned for six months by the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board in early March and lost several stable stars to rival trainers as a result. In July, he parted company with Simon Munir and Isaac Souede after a Panorama investigation reported that their popular chaser, Vyta Du Roc, previously trained by Elliott, had ended his days in a British abattoir. Cheltenham and Aintree, like every major meeting over the jumps and on the Flat before the middle of May, had unfolded in near-silence in front of empty stands. Crowds were still subject to strict limitations in June, when 4,000 spectators saw Adayar give Charlie Appleby his second Derby winner in four seasons at the start of a long summer of success that would ultimately lead to him being crowned champion trainer on the Flat for the first time. Adayar and Hurricane Lane, Appleby’s St Leger winner, are expected to remain in training to lead his title defence next year. It was also 4,000 a day at Royal Ascot a few weeks later, with the Queen among the spectators on the final day, to herald an easing of restrictions and a return to full crowds in mid-July. Oisin Murphy, with five winners, was the top rider at the Royal meeting for the first time and went on to edge a nip-and-tuck battle with William Buick for the Flat jockeys’ championship and claim the title for the third year running. Murphy had widely reported problems away from the track, however, including a fracas in a Newmarket pub and two positive tests for excess alcohol, in May and September. Britain’s best Flat jockey relinquished his licence last week to address his issues with alcohol and admitted misleading the British Horseracing Authority over a breach of Covid protocols in September 2020. and He faces a disciplinary hearing in the new year, which could result in a significant ban. A decision that could potentially have huge significance not only for racing but also many other professional sports arrived on Tuesday, when Freddy Tylicki won his legal case against fellow rider Graham Gibbons over a fall at Kempton in 2016 which left Tylicki confined to a wheelchair. The case, the first involving two jockeys in which the claim has succeeded, raises questions over stewarding, as the incident was deemed accidental at an inquiry on the day. It could also have implications for the future cost of the indemnity insurance scheme which covers jockeys against such claims. Judgment in the Tylicki case came a few days after another landmark decision – by the BHA’s independent disciplinary panel – that Robbie Dunne subjected his fellow jockey Bryony Frost to a seven-month campaign of bullying and intimidation last year. Dunne is considering an appeal against his 18-month ban, but Frost, who has spoken of being isolated by her weighing-room colleagues after lodging her complaint, will hope to move on quickly from the most difficult time of her career, perhaps with a second win on Frodon in the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day on her CV. Frodon is the 5-1 third-favourite for Sunday’s race, while Blackmore is likely to ride the second-favourite, Minella Indo. What, you wonder, would Ginger McCain make of that? Talking Horses on Monday will return on 10 Jan"
"With the first pick in the 2019 NBA draft, the New Orleans Pelicans made the obvious choice. Back then 19-year-old Zion Williamson, a Duke University freshman, was inarguably the most mesmerizing player in all of basketball, pro or amateur – a 6ft 7in, 285lb flying sledgehammer who dunked with disturbing power, rejected shot attempts with stunning alacrity and otherwise defied the accepted physics of the game in ways too inconceivable not to retweet about in wonder. His rivalry game debut against North Carolina, already an NBA All-Star-level happening that featured former president Barack Obama and other bold-face names among the capacity crowd at Cameron Indoor Arena, became an even bigger deal when Williamson ripped a Nike shoe and limped off the floor with a knee injury a minute into the game. These days, though, Williamson is a mixed bag. It’s not his talent that’s in doubt. (He’s rated among the league’s more productive players at both ends.) It’s his flagging durability, either a product of his unholy alloy of size and speed or the consequence of living in the fried food capital of the world. Williamson missed most of his rookie season with a torn right meniscus and has been dogged by injuries to his hands. He has yet to play a game this season because of a broken foot. All of this has made Williamson ripe for potshots from Charles Barkley and Shaquille O’Neal. Two years ago they roasted dire reports claiming Williamson had to relearn how to walk; in November they fell out laughing over footage of Williamson lumbering through a basic warm-up drill. “It’s like me and Shaq had a baby,” Barkley cracked. “You should not get hurt when you’re young.” All the while New Orleans continues to play mediocre ball. It’s enough to make you wonder if maybe the Pelicans got this wrong, if maybe instead of Williamson they should’ve taken that other South Carolina hoops phenom. Compared to Williamson, Ja Morant, an old youth travel league teammate, was a 6ft 3in, 173lb wisp jumping to the pros from Murray State – a “mid-major” school that had won just three NCAA tournament games. And yet: In his two years there, Morant lost only four games and reached the tournament both seasons, leading the 12th-seeded Racers to an upset win over Marquette. As Williamson began his rookie year recovering from surgery to repair his meniscus, Morant – who went second in the ’19 draft to the Memphis Grizzlies – tiptoed out of Williamson’s shadow to claim Rookie of the Year honors. In 2020-21, Morant quietly willed the Grizzlies to the playoff precipice, single-handedly knocked off the Steph Curry-led Golden State Warriors in the NBA’s inaugural play-in tournament – sealing the Grizzlies’ first playoff appearance in four seasons. Against the top-seeded Jazz, Morant poured in another ace scoring effort to help steal a game on the road. This season the Grizzlies floor general with the dreaded hair and handles isn’t sneaking up on anyone. Prior to 2021-22 campaign, he declared himself a top-five point guard – a boast that was met with some consternation. But all he’s done over the past week is state his case. On Monday at league-leading Phoenix, Morant capped a 33-point night with a twisting, fallaway, game-winning layup over two defenders. Two days later against the Lakers he went toe-to-toe with LeBron James from the three-point line, missing just once on the way to rallying the Grizzlies from a 14-point deficit to victory on the strength of a 41-point night. Incredibly, this all comes nine days after Morant heard Grizzlies fans call for him to return to the bench when he had an off night in a loss to Oklahoma City, his first game back from a three-week layoff with a sprained knee and a bout in the league’s health and safety protocol. For true Morant loyalists, the Lakers performance will hark to his college hot steaks against the likes of Belmont and SIU Edwardsville. For the rest of us, it’s more fodder for comparisons to Curry – the ultimate underrated small college kid who turns his sleights into cannon fodder. “Go back to LA!” was his parting shot to the spectators who dared show up to FedEx Forum dressed in purple and gold. Morant has always been a wizard with the ball, equally adept at displacing defenders off the dribble or off a glance. Now he’s applying that same sorcery in service of his greatly improved long-distance stroke. Mindful of Morant’s explosive first step, Lakers defenders had to think twice before deciding whether to pick him up at the three-point line. That moment of hesitation was often enough to guarantee Morant wide-open looks against a flailing Avery Bradley or Russell Westbrook when Morant wasn’t crashing the offensive boards, blocking shots or spinning around more lost Lakers defenders in the paint. Overall he burned them for six makes, a career best. Most impressive: the Grizzlies, who have rebounded from an 9-10 start to leading the Southwest division, have the form of a playoff shoo-in. As Morant’s scoring average (24.5 points) and his three-point accuracy (38.3%) continue to climb, it appears the 22-year-old may have sold himself short. Forget the league’s top-five point guards. Right now Morant looks like a top-five player – like a prime Derrick Rose, but with far greater judiciousness and restraint. Or, at the very least, Morant looks like he should’ve been the top pick all along. Why he wasn’t has less to do with Morant’s talent than the LeBron-level hype around Williamson. What’s more, New Orleans tried building a team around a point guard before, and Chris Paul – one of the best ever at that position – could only do so much. Still: as hard as it is for any pro talent evaluator to justify passing on a big man many were touting as the next Charles Barkley, there remained some doubt about exactly what position Williamson would play. And that was before the questions about his eating habits. Citing his league sources, ESPN hoops reporter Tim MacMahon reckoned Williamson weighed around 330lbs – and damned if that doesn’t come across in Williamson’s Mountain Dew commercials. While Williamson reaches for another beignet (allegedly), Morant seems to have stayed away from Memphis’ famed BBQ and soul food joints. That figures, given Morant’s estimable reputation as a workout warrior who owes his own early viral fame to the improvised workouts dreamed up by his father, Tee – a high school teammate of Ray Allen’s. But here’s really why Morant could’ve gone No 1: basketball is a little man’s game now. And in a league where layups and threes rule, Morant, not Williamson, is the player with the greater upside. But then again it is still early days. Williamson’s career isn’t over yet, and who knows how much time he could buy back time with a better diet and discipline. Until he gets it back together, you can’t say you didn’t see Ja Morant coming anymore. If you don’t think he’s a top player yet, at the very least you now know this: he’s hungry, too."
"Dominic Thiem, beaten men’s singles finalist in 2020, is out of next month’s Australian Open after failing to recover from a long-standing wrist injury. The 28-year-old Austrian, who has not played since suffering the injury at the Mallorca Open in June, was unable to defend his US Open title this year. Thiem soared to No 3 in the world until the injury halted his progress and relegated him to his current ranking of 15. Thiem was beaten in the fourth round of the 2021 Open in three straights by Grigor Dimitrov, while the year before he was beaten in five sets in the final at Melbourne Park by Novak Djokovic. He will begin his 2022 season on his preferred surface of clay at the Cordoba Open in Argentina at the end of January. “I will miss the Australian fans, but I will be back (there) in 2023,” he said on Twitter. “We believe this is the right decision in order to have a good return to competition. “For the moment I will remain in Austria for a few more days and then head to practise outdoors and get ready for my first event of the season.” Not for the first time in recent years, the Australian Open will be missing a number of top players, with more arriving short of match practice and fitness. World No 1 Novak Djokovic pulled out of the ATP Cup in Sydney, which is due to start on 1 January, on Wednesday as uncertainty over his participation in the grand slam goes on. Djokovic has won at Melbourne Park on nine occasions but has repeatedly refused to say whether he has been vaccinated against coronavirus having previously expressed hesitancy over being jabbed. All players competing are required either to be vaccinated or to provide proof of medical exemption, but that will not be made public. Speaking to media in Melbourne last week, tournament director Craig Tiley said: “If Novak shows up at the Australian Open, he’ll either be vaccinated or he’ll have a medical exemption. “[It’s] his choice on his medical condition, it’s his choice to keep [it] personal and private like all of us would do with any condition we may or may not have. We are not going to force him or ask him to disclose that.” Elsewhere on the men’s side, 20-time grand slam champion Roger Federer is still recovering from knee surgery, joining Stan Wawrinka and Milos Raonic on the sidelines. 2009 winner Rafael Nadal and Denis Shapovalov have both recently tested positive for Covid. In the women’s draw, 23-time grand slam champion Serena Williams heads the list of absentees, while Jennifer Brady, Karolína Plíšková, Karolína Muchová, and Bianca Andreescu are all set to miss out."
"Only six people in the world have won the 100m dash in back-to-back Olympic Games. The first was Wyomia Tyus in 1964 and 1968. Next was Carl Lewis, then Gail Devers, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Usain Bolt (who won three times in a row), and Elaine Thompson-Herah. To many people, the name Wyomia Tyus is less familiar than the others. Tyus was not only the first Olympian to win back-to-back gold in its prestige event – she also made history in other ways. At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when Tyus crossed the line first in the 100 meters, she set a world record of 11.08 seconds. And when she ran, she was wearing dark shorts instead of the team-issued white shorts, a gesture to show her support for human rights. “I was not doing it for any type of glory or anything,” Tyus says. “It was just for me as a person, as a human being, and my feelings and what I thought about what was going on in the world, and how women – Black women especially – were treated.” Tyus grew up in Griffin, Georgia, in the Jim Crow South and became one of the Tigerbelles, a track and field powerhouse coached by Ed Temple at Tennessee State University. In Mexico City, two days after Tyus’s win in the 100 meters, John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the podium in what became an iconic image. They were swiftly escorted out of the Olympic Village and sent home for their protest. Tyus also won gold in the 4x100 meter relay, and she dedicated her win to Carlos and Smith. No one really picked up on Tyus’s own demonstration, and she didn’t talk about why she wore the dark blue (almost black) shorts. “They didn’t care about what I did, because I was a woman and I was Black,” she says. Leading up to the 1968 Olympics, the Olympic Project for Human Rights discussed ways athletes might demonstrate. But Tyus says she and the Tigerbelles weren’t included in the plans or asked if they were on board. “No one came to us. The whole movement started, and it was more like, ‘Well, this is what we say, and the women are going to follow,’” she says. “I don’t know if those words were spoken, but those are the words I felt.” So Tyus decided on her own to wear her dark shorts. “I grew up with colored bathrooms, colored water fountains, all those kinds of things. It’s not like I did not know how unfair things were happening to Black people, and especially women,” she says. Martha Watson, a four-time Olympian between 1964 and 1976, was one of Tyus’s Tigerbelle teammates. She remembers other members of the 1968 US team talking about plans to demonstrate if they made it to the medals stand. “We knew what was going on,” Watson says. “I mean, we lived it. I grew up in California, and I went to school in Tennessee. I could go shopping, but I couldn’t try clothes on in Tennessee. That was a rude awakening for me.” People who follow track and field know the names of Tommie Smith and John Carlos – as well as Lewis, Devers, Fraser-Pryce, Bolt, and Thompson-Herah. When Lewis won back-to-back gold in the 100 meters in 1984 and 1988, Tyus remembers people celebrating him for being the first, overlooking her achievement two decades earlier. Why did society skip over her? Maybe people just weren’t paying attention to women’s track in the ‘60s. But that’s not the only reason, Tyus says. “Are they going to give a Black woman that kind of power, to be the first one to do this, ever – in the history of the Olympic Games?” she says. “I mean, I go there with that.” At the time, women – especially Black women – were expected to “just sit back and be quiet, and don’t say very much,” says Tyus’s Tigerbelle teammate and 1964 Olympian Edith McGuire, who came in second to Tyus in the 100 meters. She also won gold in the 200 meters and silver in the 4x100 relay with Tyus. At the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, McGuire recalls that the coach of the US men’s team wasn’t going to let the women use the starting blocks designated for the US sprinters. Temple was coaching the women’s team, and he had to fight for them to be able to use the blocks, she says. Tyus and McGuire were both from Georgia. After the Olympics, they were honored with a parade through Atlanta, but it only went through the Black neighborhoods. Despite being Olympic champions, both were slighted for being Black, for being women, or both. “To me, Wyomia has still not gotten the due that she should have for winning back-to-back 100 meters in the ‘64 and ‘68 Olympics,” McGuire says. “If she was a man or a white woman, then I think it would have been totally different.” Even in the history of women’s track, among other Black women, Tyus seems to get overlooked. “When people think of female athletes in track and field, Wilma Rudolph is the only person they remember, or FloJo [Florence Griffith Joyner]. There’s a big void in between,” Watson says. She says part of the reason may be that “Tyus was never really flamboyant--she just went out there and did what she had to do.” “I am still surprised that she has to blow her own horn,” Watson says. “Skeeter [Rudolph] didn’t have to do that. FloJo didn’t have to do that.” Tyus grew up on a dairy farm, playing all kinds of sports with her three older brothers, even though girls weren’t really supposed to do that. For girls, “It was a ‘You can go outside and play, but don’t sweat’ kind of thing,” she says. “I wanted to be as good as my brothers, if not better.… In order to play with them and the other boys in the neighborhood, I had to be good. I had to be able to hold my own.” When she was a teenager, her house burned down, and her father died not long after. Tyus had been close to her father, and after his death, she withdrew and didn’t talk much. That’s when she turned to running track. “I was brokenhearted and depressed, and I was not doing anything. My mom kept saying, ‘You know, your dad would not want this. He would like to see you do something with your life,’” she says. “It was more something to do, and also get my mom off my back.” One summer, Temple invited her to a track camp at Tennessee State. Before then, she hadn’t realized she was very good at track, because another girl at her high school always beat her, she says. “That summer, the camp pretty much changed my life,” she says. “It changed the way I looked at myself. I thought maybe I could go to college – because my mom could not send me to college.” The opportunities available to Black women were pretty much limited to becoming a teacher or a nurse, she recalls. Tennessee State gave Tyus a scholarship – a path Temple created for many women who wouldn’t have been able to afford college, Tyus says. Temple’s team consistently developed Olympic champions, including Wilma Rudolph. More than 40 Tigerbelles competed at the Olympics from the ‘50s to the ‘80s, and they won 23 medals. “The whole relay team in 1960 was from Tennessee State,” Tyus points out. Watson says of the Tigerbelles: “I think it’s probably one of the most special things that’s happened with women in sports, and Black women also.” Tyus wrote a memoir called Tigerbelle, in part to celebrate what Temple had done for women who otherwise could not have gone to college. “To convince an HBCU to do this for Black women – he never really got the credit for it. All the things he’s done – he gave all of us chances,” Tyus says. The Tigerbelles were like a sisterhood that has endured through the decades, McGuire says. She and Tyus also developed a close friendship with Temple up until his death in 2016. “He called Wyomia and I the gold dust twins,” McGuire says. Whenever she and Tyus went back to Tennessee State, they’d visit Temple. “We would sit in his living room and talk like three little old biddies.” Although Tyus’s quiet demonstration in 1968 and historic Olympic wins never garnered much public attention, she still paved the way for today’s athlete activists to demonstrate against injustices. It’s not that women weren’t speaking out in previous decades, Tyus says. “Nobody was putting the mic in front of their face to let them talk,” she says. “But now, women have a platform, and people are seeing them totally differently. I think Title IX has a lot to do with that, too.” In recent years, many athletes – particularly Black women – have used their platform to advocate for change. Tyus points to the WNBA. “They were out front before anybody. ... They wanted to reach the masses of people to say, ‘Hey, look, this is what’s happening, we need to make a change.’” In track and field, Gwen Berry and Raven Saunders have advocated for human rights, including racial justice. Berry echoed Carlos and Smith’s protest when she raised her fist on the podium at the 2019 Pan American Games. She was reprimanded and put on probation by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, which has since changed its rules. But the International Olympic Committee still prohibits athletes from raising a fist on the podium. In some ways, today’s athletes are advocating for the same issues Tyus did in 1968. “The changes are happening, but they may not be happening fast enough,” Tyus says. “My dad used to say, ‘You always have to stay in the fight,’” Tyus says. “I have tried to maintain that. And I think that all the women, from Gwen Berry on – they are standing for things that will make this a better world in which to live for everybody, not just for one group of people.” And that fight can take different forms, as Tyus has shown, McGuire says. “You don’t always have to be boisterous,” she says. “No one should say, ‘Well, you didn’t get out there and raise your fist.’ Maybe that’s not my way. My way would be different. Everybody should do whatever they want to do in their own way.” After the Olympics, Tyus was part of a group of women, along with Billie Jean King, who helped establish the Women’s Sports Foundation. They connected while speaking on the “banquet circuit” about their experiences in sports, Tyus recalls. “Women would come up to you and say, ‘I just wish someone had encouraged me in this, that, and the other. And I would like to have my daughters really be recognized and be in a sport,’” she says. Supporting that effort was important to Tyus. “Women shouldn’t have to fight for it like this. Women should be encouraged to be in sports. And that was not happening,” she says. Tyus spent 18 years as a naturalist for the Los Angeles Unified School District, working with kids at a weeklong camp, teaching them about the natural sciences and taking care of the planet. She watched some of them who’d never spent much time outdoors before experience what it was like to be out in nature. You could see them grow in the week they were there, she says. And it took her back to her childhood, when she spent time hiking through the woods with her dad and brothers. “I know that she’s touched some people. They may not turn out to be an Olympic athlete, but they’ll be an Olympic person” who exemplifies the Olympic creed that the journey is more important than winning, Watson says. “She’s my example of that.” “She and Wilma, in my eyes, are the greatest, without a doubt,” Watson says. “I’ve known Tyus for over 50 years, and I’ve trained with her. I know that whatever they did on that track came from them. They had no enhancing things to make them run faster. It all came from blood, sweat, and tears on that track, and determination. … And even though she’s not on the Wheaties box, she’s a genuine champion, her heart and her soul.”"
"However incompatible they superficially appear, the link between English cricket and Christmas has blossomed since the moment their first travelling team docked in Melbourne on 24 December 1861. But the visitors’ yuletide experience has changed considerably from the days when WG Grace visited in 1873 and spent Christmas Day hunting, unsuccessfully, for kangaroo before enjoying “a good, long, late night”. Or the apparently less enjoyable trip 24 years later when Ted Wainwright, the Yorkshire all-rounder, mournfully informed his teammates over lunch: “I wish I was back in the little cottage turning the meat.” On the Bodyline tour of 1932-33, Douglas Jardine spent the big day fishing in Tasmania, a turn of events the local tourist board considered so exciting they issued a commemorative postcard. In 1936 the tourists, already away from home for more than three months, celebrated with particular gusto – although “some confessed they would rather be among the snow and sleet of England” than at the team’s Christmas dinner in a private room at Usher’s hotel in Sydney, where “all formality was dropped, and there was much good-natured banter and singing” – being as they were 2-0 up in a five-Test series. They lost the next three. The Boxing Day Test has become, in the words of Mark Butcher, “a major part of cricketing folklore”, but it was a surprisingly recent addition to the calendar. England and Australia first met on that date in 1950, when the second Test resumed on 26 December after two days off. The following year, West Indies played Test cricket on Christmas Day itself, which one tourist declared “sacrilegious” and was not much more popular with the home side. “I have never played on Christmas Day before in my life and don’t like having to do so now,” an unnamed Australian said. The first Test to start on Boxing Day followed 18 years later, and the first time England had a go was 1974. Since 1980 only four Australian summers have been without one – 1984, 1988 and 1994 – when Tests started before Christmas and resumed afterwards, and the fallow year of 1989, when Australia played an ODI against Sri Lanka instead. Between 1980 and 1985 there were four draws in six years and in this period the MCG was heavily criticised for everything from the quality of pitches to their toilet facilities. Thankfully, as the Guardian reported in 1981, “the Melbourne public are said to be willing to watch anything”, and in 1982 the nascent tradition was boosted by “one of the most consistently thrilling Tests of all time”. It was the first to feature four innings that all ended within 10 runs of each other, was on a knife-edge from the start and never left, and remains the joint third closest in history. It ended with Australia needing 292 to win but after Norman Cowans, playing his third Test and having taken a total of one wicket in his first two, had snaffled his sixth of the second innings to dismiss Rodney Hogg they were 74 away as their last batter, Jeff Thomson, came out to join Allan Border. “The rest of the blokes in our dressing room thought I would have a slog and get out. But it didn’t happen that way,” Thomson said. “I can still picture the England side’s growing anxiety. They had stupid fields, bowled badly and everything was in the batsmen’s favour.” After a couple of rain delays they were still 37 away at the end of day four, and 18,000 people turned up to see them edge towards their target the following morning. Australia were just four away when Ian Botham bowled to Thomson. “It was a half-tracker and a bit of an away swinger. A bad ball, really,” Thomson said. “I just tried to push it for a single rather than smash it. All I did was get an edge.” The ball flew straight to Chris Tavaré at second slip, who caught it with his left hand but couldn’t hold it; Geoff Miller at first slip grabbed it before it fell to earth. “I couldn’t talk about it for years,” said Thomson. “It was one of the all-time low moments in my life.” In the crowd, attending his first Test, a 13-year-old Shane Warne sat transfixed; he went on to play 10 Boxing Day Tests, took a hat-trick as England were beaten in 1994, and now has a statue outside the ground. Of the 10 MCG Boxing Day Tests England have won four, lost four and drawn two, making it a particularly fertile fixture. The other Ashes classic came in 1998. An Australia side already 2-0 up in the series and apparently coasting to victory, set just 175 to win and at one point 103 for two, were derailed by “their own complacency and an astounding effort from the England pace attack”, in the words of the Guardian’s Mike Selvey. It ended with a mammoth four-hour session which ended after Mark Taylor decided, with seven wickets down and just 13 needed, to claim a discretionary half-hour to complete Australia’s victory. England promptly took three in five balls to win by 12. Where once visiting English cricketers were hunters, this year’s tourists seem to have spent most of their trip being hunted. However their Christmas ends, though, it will have looked very different to the one the players experienced in 1903, when before going to the theatre on Christmas Eve they were taken on a tour of Sydney’s opium and gambling dens. “Interesting to see,” Sussex’s Bert Relf wrote. “Would not go again.”"
"England’s latest batting collapse in Australia follows on from a series of below average scores from the men’s Test team in the past year. Statistics show the top order fairs poorly compared with other countries, and well adrift of their six main rivals. Here we take a look at the stats which highlight how poor England’s batters have been since Joe Root was named Test captain in February 2017. 30.32 Root has averaged 47.66 since being named captain. England’s other top six batters have averaged 30.32. 50 The total number of ducks by England batters in 2021 is 50. The next highest figure this century is 33. In total, 17.2% of England innings in 2021 have ended without scoring. There has only ever been one other year with more than 33 England ducks: 1998, when there were 54 (17.1% of all innings). 24.80 Average runs scored by England batters in 2021. 0 Previous years this century when England have averaged less than 25 runs per wicket.

"In his seminal work on nationalism, Eric Hobsbawm wrote that “the imagined community of millions seems more real as a team of 11 named people.” He meant that as a criticism – the line is drawn from a passage where the historian described the use of sport, especially football, to inculcate nationalist fervour in Europe during the interwar years. “The individual, even the one who only cheers, becomes a symbol of his nation himself,” Hobsbawm added. But in 2021, the power of sport for good was firmly on display. Amid the darkest year for Australia in decades, sport has offered hope, distraction and unity. When a majority of Australians were midway through a bruising lockdown, the nation’s Olympians and Paralympians delivered inspiration and joy in equal measure. The somewhat-fragile imagined community of Australia manifested on the shoulders of its successful athletes in Tokyo. And what success it was. Australia’s 17 Olympic gold medals this year equalled its best performance ever, matched only by Athens 2004. After a slide down the medal table at London 2012 and then Rio 2016 (where the green and gold took home just eight gold medals), Tokyo represented an emphatic return to form for a historically dominant sporting nation. In the pool, Australia’s swimmers had their best ever Olympics. Emma McKeon’s seven medals, including four golds, made her the most-decorated Australian athlete at a single Olympics. A new golden generation emerged before our eyes – Ariarne Titmus dethroned American Katie Ledecky as queen of the pool, while backstroke supremo Kaylee McKeown had viewers in tears as she paid tribute to her recently-deceased father after each of her three gold medals. Aged just 21 and 20 respectively, the pair have distinguished careers ahead of them. Australians dominated on top of the water, too, in rowing, surfing and canoeing. Owen Wright and Jess Fox offered lessons in determination and persistence – Wright won bronze as surfing made its Olympic debut, five years after he suffered what could have been a career-ending injury, while the flying canoeist Fox won the gold medal that had eluded her for a decade. At the Tokyo stadium, sprinter Rohan Browning came agonisingly close to breaking the 10-second barrier, while Peter Bol captivated the nation with his endurance in the 800m and his eloquence in the spotlight. On the last weekend of Olympic action, the Boomers finally won Australia’s first men’s basketball medal, led by the inspirational Patty Mills, who had earlier become the first Indigenous athlete to carry Australia’s flag in the opening ceremony. It felt, at least momentarily, that a divided nation had come together; to collectively celebrate victory, mourn defeat and appreciate the raw humanity of sport. “To Australia I’m thankful,” Bol said after winning his semi-final. “We’re just human at the end of the day. We inspired the whole nation – that’s the goal.” While the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics offered a temporary reprieve from a difficult reality (plus, some months later, a maiden T20 World Cup triumph for Australia’s cricketers), the joy did not last. The AFL and NRL’s high-profile vaccine mandate dilemmas were not a distraction but a microcosm of wider societal tensions over the jab. One of Australia’s premier cycling teams accepted sponsorship cash from Saudi Arabia as part of the murderous regime’s efforts at sportwashing its image, while Winter Olympians were left in an invidious position by the silence of international and Australian Olympic committees on China’s human rights record as the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing loom. Just as Australia at large was grappling with an allegation of gender-based and sexual violence – most prominently at Parliament House – so too did a cloud of abuse and mistreatment linger over sport. Six months before its parliamentary equivalent, the Australian Human Rights Commission released a report on “systemic” problems in gymnastics. A lawyer who represented numerous athletes during the inquiry described the sport as a “petri dish for abuse”. On the eve of the Olympics, Rio medallist Maddie Groves made allegations of abuse and mistreatment within swimming. More recently, an investigation by the ABC raised separate allegations of historical sexual abuse in the sport. Football and hockey also confronted concerns about high-performance culture over the past 12 months, while an independent review found that AFL club Collingwood had a culture of structural racism. The NRL continues to grapple with allegations of domestic and sexual violence against star players. While it is depressing to admit, perhaps none of this should surprise us. We know, both anecdotally and empirically, that Australia has a sexual harassment problem, an abuse problem and a racism problem. Just as sport offers a vivid image of our imagined communities – a heady mix of tribalism and nationalism – so too does it reflect society itself. We would be naïve to think otherwise. If harassment is rife in our parliament, why wouldn’t it be prevalent in our locker-rooms? Both must be urgently addressed. 2021 was a year which highlighted the best and worst of Australian sport. The same can be said of Australian society as a whole. Hopefully 2022 offers more highs and less lows – that, surely, is something we can all cheer for."
"Cricketers, more than most sportspeople, measure their achievement in numbers – be that runs scored, wickets taken, or matches played. So you can understand why Eileen Ash was so celebrated for her record-breaking innings: at 110 years old she was the longest-living Test cricketer of all time by an impressive margin of seven years (the runner-up was South Africa’s Norman Gordon). After her death, the tributes paid from the cricket world recalled her energetic and enduring spirit as much as her bowling achievements for England and Middlesex. During the last decade of her life, she found a popularity she had never experienced during her playing days, and the England men’s team even took to the field wearing black armbands in her honour on the first day of the current Ashes series. A right-arm seam bowler, Ash played seven consecutive Tests for England between 1937 and 1949 in an international career interrupted by the second world war. “The war was a terrible waste of one’s life,” she later observed. “I’ve been lucky, though, because I’ve had extra years over 100.” Like so many female cricketers, Ash’s pioneering contributions in the early days of the women’s domestic game – playing first-class matches for Middlesex, South of England, and the Civil Service – were largely uncelebrated by the cricketing establishment of the time. It wasn’t until she had achieved her personal century that her profile became elevated, within and without the sport; her 100th birthday was marked with the gift of honorary life membership of MCC, a club that had refused to accept female members or even to allow them to play at their Lord’s ground until decades after Ash’s sporting retirement. Thanks to her longevity and to her ease in front of a camera, Ash and her seven-Test career became a signifier for the history of the much-ignored women’s game as a whole, and a link to the golden, interwar period when the organisation of the women’s game was first founded. That era uncovered and inspired some powerful talents, including Myrtle Maclagan and Betty Snowball. In belatedly feting Ash, cricket was in effect tipping its cap to an entire lost generation. Born in Highbury in north London, Eileen Whelan, as she was then, fell for cricket extremely early – her two brothers and her father both played for a local club, and her uncle had given her her first bat by the age of five (she used to take it to bed with her, along with a ball and a set of stumps). She did not, however, come from the usual background for a female cricketer of the time. Her parents, James, an assistant accountant in the civil service, and Charlotte (nee George), who was in service, were neither well-off nor well-connected. She did not go to one of the private schools where most prewar women’s cricket was played, but instead to Ursuline Convent school for girls in Ilford, Essex, where only hockey was on the menu. A natural athlete, she captained the school hockey team and excelled at squash, but pursued her passion for cricket whenever she got the chance. She followed her father into the civil service at the age of 18, joining as a telephonist, at least in part because she had heard she would be given days off to play cricket for her employer. Seven years later, in 1937, she made her England debut against Australia, taking four for 68 in what would remain her best international performance. She played in all three Tests of the drawn home series, finishing with more than creditable figures of 10 wickets at an average of 23. Unfortunately for Ash, the war was on its way and she was then unable to take to the crease for her country for more than a decade. Her government work saw her seconded to MI6, a period about which she retained a strict discretion until the day she died: even if, as her son suggests, it might have been partly to make it seem more glamorous than it really was. England did not play again until after the second world war, but on their return to Australia and New Zealand, 11 years later, Ash was picked for all four Tests, despite being in her late 30s. The oldest woman selected, she emerged wicketless, but her strength and stamina remained an asset and her gregariousness was much appreciated on a tour as packed with travel and official engagements as it was with net practice. Her diaries from that time, kept private during her lifetime, remain in the family and are likely to be a valuable addition to the cricketing archives. An encounter with Don Bradman resulted in him giving her one of his bats – which she later kept by her bed in case she ever needed to fight off a burglar. She met her husband, Wilfrid Ash, when they lived on the same road in Ilford during the 1920s, and in their later years they lived in Norfolk in a house next door to their son, Christopher; Wilfrid died in 2004. Ash, who continued to play golf until 98, frequently suggested that yoga and red wine had helped her have such a long life, although she also pointed out that it was important to “like other people”. A private woman, she disliked to navel-gaze. Instead she expressed herself through her passions; she was an avid driver of a yellow mini and later enjoyed a taste of wider fame when she appeared on a TV documentary about centenarians behind the wheel. When she heard that 97-year-old Prince Philip had rolled his Land Rover, she considered it a sign and gave up the next day. But her boundlessly adventurous spirit never left her, and for her 106th birthday she aped another beloved England cricketer, David Gower, by taking a passenger trip in a Tiger Moth. She is survived by Christopher, three grandchildren, Ben, Anna and Harriet, and eight great-grandchildren. • Eileen Ash, cricketer, born 30 October 1911; died 3 December 2021"
"After a period of unprecedented, sustained success, the Seahawks have bottomed out. Now, they’re at a crossroads. Defeat to the Bears last Sunday dropped the Seahawks to 5-11 on the season. They have no shot at making the playoffs. The roster features a rotating morass of mediocrity. There are questions about the future of their franchise quarterback, head coach and chief personnel decision-maker. Things could be about to get ugly. There remains an oft-repeated myth around Seattle that the Russell Wilson-Pete Carroll partnership turned sour once the franchise quarterback started to get paid like a franchise quarterback. The theory makes some sense. The Seahawks were the first team to truly take advantage of the modern Collective Bargaining Agreement that turned a quarterback on a rookie contract into the sport’s leading market inefficiency. Seattle had Wilson on the cheap, and it was able to surround him with a bevy of Hall of Famers slap-bang in the middle of their primes. Carroll, Wilson and the vaunted Legion of Boom stomped all over the NFC on their way to two Super Bowls, winning one and dropping the other to the Brady-Belichick Patriots, falling one yard short of back-to-back titles. It would be neat and easy if things took a sudden downshift from there; if paying Wilson was the sole reason for the decline – the expense of a $30m per year quarterback meaning talent leaking out of the roster elsewhere. It’s also inaccurate. This year represents Carroll’s first losing season as a coach since 2011. Since the Seahawks drafted Wilson in 2012, few if any franchises have matched the pair’s success, including the period in which Wilson was signed to an extension. Tampa Bay with Brady, Kansas City with Mahomes, and New Orleans with Drew Brees certainly had (and have) no issues maintaining a championship-caliber roster with a quarterback subsuming more than 20% of the salary cap. Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott and Josh Allen all absorb a higher percentage of their team’s cap sheet, on average, than Wilson. It is not a question of Seattle being able to sign, draft or trade for talent that would fit under the cap to support Wilson. It’s about who the Seahawks have opted to sign, draft and trade for. This season is the result of a near-decade of iffy draft and personnel decisions, dating back to the very start of the Wilson era. Since 2013, the Seahawks have made 15 draft picks in the first or second round. Only one, DK Metcalf, has made a Pro Bowl. Three – Metcalf, Frank Clark, Jarran Reed – would be considered above average players. Only one of those, Metcalf again, remains with the team. On top of that, they traded first-rounders for Jimmy Graham, Percy Harvin and two first-rounders for Jamal Adams. All three were misses; the Adams whiff not only hit the team talent-wise but also forced Seattle to completely re-define the stylistic makeup of their defense to try to accommodate his weaknesses. A franchise quarterback and a savvy, defense-first coach can only cover up so many defects. At some point, the other players must make some plays. Seattle simply lacks talent. That’s partly why Wilson looked to bail on the whole enterprise last offseason. As he’s always very keen to point out, Wilson did not demand a trade. He simply pointed out the four specific teams he would like to go to if Seattle wanted to trade him, which, obviously, he did not want. No, sir. It was a masterclass in petty. The carefully coordinated media leaks. The Tune Out The Noise social media onslaught. As reported by the Athletic, Wilson believed things had grown stale. It was reported that Wilson, and others, had started to tune out Carroll’s happy-clappy style. The Seahawks have tried to evolve in all the ways Wilson would ever demand. They shifted philosophies on defense, trying to keep up with all of the game’s latest innovations, rather than sticking doggedly to the style that drove them through their initial period of success. On offense, there has been a willingness to change things, too. From the caveman stylings of Brian Schottenheimer and Darrell Bevell, the Seahawks looked to get younger and slicker by bringing in Shane Waldron from the Rams to run the offense. But any sense of the Seahawks embracing the confuse-and-clobber style that powered the Jared Goff era Rams has not come to fruition. There are two reasons: a) defenses finding counters to that style of offense (the Seahawks missed on when they wanted to jump into that evolutionary cycle); b) Russell Wilson. At this point, it’s clear there’s not a Seahawks style or a Schottenheimer style or a Waldron style or a Carroll style. It’s Wilson’s style. His unwillingness to throw over the middle of the field has taken on meme-level proportions this season. Wilson has attempted just 26 passes of 10 yards or more over the middle of the field this season, an average of two a game. By comparison, Tom Brady is averaging seven such attempts a game, Aaron Rodgers is averaging five, Patrick Mahomes is averaging four. In fact, among 34 eligible quarterbacks this season, Wilson ranks 29th in the league in the average number of attempts per game he targets beyond ten yards in the middle of the field. To play in a Russell Wilson offense means to forfeit the middle of the field, which constricts whatever Seattle might like to do on offense. This has been a long-running theme to Wilson’s game. It’s why he’s able to limit turnovers, but in playing such a compressed style defenses can better cut off his supply line outside. Wilson’s game has always been built around the deep ball. He takes the easy guff underneath and launches delightful darts down the field to move the Seahawks offense along. This year, as defenses vacate the middle and focus on the perimeter, his effectiveness has tumbled. His adjusted completion percentage (which removes throwaways) ranks 23rd among eligible quarterbacks this season on throws of 20 yards or more, per Pro Football Focus. That puts him behind Davis Mills, Tua Tagovailoa, Carson Wentz and a fossilized Ben Roethlisberger, hardly a who’s who of Favre-ian gunslingers. As much as the offense needed to adapt and grow coming into the year, so did its pilot. He did not. Wilson then got hurt. Before the Seahawks could blink, the season had slipped away. As this offseason approaches, Seattle’s ownership now faces a tricky choice: to move on from Carroll; to move on from Wilson; to move on from everyone, including John Schneider, the personnel czar. There’s little to no chance all three will return. Two of them? Maybe. Carroll departing seems the most likely outcome. Whether or not Wilson’s season-long slump is indicative of anything longer-term, the Seahawks want nothing to do with the annual quarterback merry-go-round. Moving on from Carroll is likely the team’s best shot to convince the quarterback to stick around long-term. Carroll deserves credit for his willingness to re-energize the franchise, for trying to evolve rather than getting stuck in his own fuddy-duddy ways. This isn’t the story of a coach who stayed too long, or an organization that went down thinking its way would always be The Way. This is a team that paired a talented quarterback with an excellent coach and an extraordinary roster and ran through the league like few before. Two remain true, yet the final and most important part, the core of the roster, has sunk to depressing levels of incompetence. Now, they need a reboot. “Not for one reason at all am I thinking that we need to restart the whole thing,” Carroll said this week. There is some truth there. The Seahawks will be flush with the cap space needed to re-fashion the roster around Wilson if the quarterback wishes to stick around. But the Seahawks do need a fairly dramatic overhaul. Making a break from coach and quarterback at this stage would be easier than betting on the two to rediscover their old mojo."
"It took some work but Australia wrapped up the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before tea on day four, by an innings and 182 runs, taking nine South African wickets to restrict the tourists to 204 all out. The result breaks South Africa’s streak of three series wins on Australian soil, and made it two from two for Australia this summer after beating the West Indies. David Warner won the Johnny Mullagh Medal for best on ground after his double century on the match’s hottest day, while Mitchell Starc was influential despite bowling with an injured hand. Against an undermanned attack, the result spoke both of Australia’s tenacity and South Africa’s batting frailty. Cameron Green did not take the field, having broken a finger while batting. Starc had injured the middle finger on his bowling hand while fielding in the first innings, and had to protect it throughout. Nathan Lyon took a heavy fall fielding at backward point and had to leave for treatment. But South Africa could not force Australia to overbowl Patrick Cummins and Scott Boland, folding inside 69 overs. Their batting problems were summed up by Temba Bavuma’s day, the vice-captain providing the stiffest resistance with his innings of 65, but sacrificing two partners along the way. Khaya Zondo honoured his call after Bavuma dropped a ball at the feet of Travis Head at cover, gone to a direct hit for one run. Spinner Keshav Maharaj was batting well when he called for a third. Bavuma bizarrely turned for the run with his back to his partner, stopped while looking at deep cover, then looked up to find Maharaj in his pocket. Had Bavuma kept going he might have made it, but Maharaj lost too much time turning back, with Starc receiving Labuschagne’s long throw and pinging down the striker’s stumps. Things started predictably after South Africa began the day 371 runs behind while Australia had an innings to spare. Sarel Erwee and Theunis de Bruyn nearly got through the first ten overs, but with a ceiling of about 20 runs at present, Erwee was smashed on the toe by a Starc yorker on 21, while de Bruyn was a slip-cordon liability with edges dropping short or flying over before Boland jumped one at his gloves on 29 to provide Steve Smith’s 150th Test catch. After the pre-lunch Zondo barbecue it was 65 for four. Bavuma responded to his mistake admirably, playing positive shots and continuing to run hard, the same way that wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne has consistently played this series. They put on 65 either side of the lunch break, Verreynne reverse-sweeping Lyon and crunching a pull shot against Starc while Bavuma preferred conventional sweeps and cover punches. Boland though knows how to use the MCG pitch. The perfect length, full enough to bring the stumps into play, some inward jag off the seam, and he beat Verreynne’s inside edge to hit him in front of middle stump on 33. Lyon returned from his injury break to hit Marco Jansen on the back leg for five, and the Maharaj run-out quenched the spark in Bavuma at last, as he hacked across the line to send a high catch to midwicket. Rabada played similarly to give Lyon a third, before the last pair of Anrich Nortje and Lungi Ngidi had some fun slogging 27, an unlikely end sparing South Africa the ignominy of making less than 200 for eight innings in a row. Not that it made this performance any less abject than those preceding it. The ironic cheers as the scoreboard ticked over said a lot, as did the fact that Steve Smith’s occasional leg-breaks finished the match when Ngidi missed one that drifted nicely and turned past his bat. There will be changes for the Sydney Test, with Green and presumably Starc to miss - although Starc, with 18 overs, bowled more than anybody in the final innings of the match. His figures of 1 for 62 don’t reflect his effort or impact, while Cummins kept the pressure on all day for 1 for 20. Boland’s 2 for 49 was a less dramatic return than his Ashes outing last year, but his wickets were important, while Lyon played his part with 3 for 58. For South Africa, changes are unlikely to help, while memories of those dominant touring teams of years past are fading fast."
"And here’s Geoff Lemon’s report at the end of day one at the Gabba: After winning the toss and putting South Africa into bat Australia’s bowlers did the business, requiring barely 49 overs to dismiss a fragile touring line-up (with a tail that begins at No 7) for just 152. Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon took three wickets apiece, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland two, as only one Proteas partnership passed 15. Kyle Verreynne’s 64 was the only knock of note, and while he was supported by Temba Bavuma (38) South Africa looked in the contest. But before and after their partnership, wickets tumbled in ugly clusters as Australia’s pacers found a dangerous length and Lyon extracted prodigious bounce. Australia’s reply began badly with David Warner’s lean run of form continuing with a golden duck, and his side were soon 27 for 3 as Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen, and Anrich Nortje all lived up to the hype. That was when Travis Head took over, accelerating from two runs from 16 deliveries to a 48-ball half-century. His thrilling counterattack reached 78 by the close and his partnership with Steve Smith (36) threatened to take the game out of South Africa’s reach on the opening day, only for a couple of late wickets to add intrigue to day two. Thank you for joining us today, we’ll be back to do it all again tomorrow. And with that, the players walk off. Boland did his job, despite falling for a brief one. An excellent late fightback from the Proteas to keep them in the running, but Australia are firmly in the box seat after an action packed day. Rabada pushes through fatigue to bowl his 12th over of the session – and he gets his reward! Length delivery, Boland props forward, regulation edge behind and Verreyenne makes no mistake. 33rd over: Australia 145-4 (Head 78, Boland 1) Scott Boland comes out as the nightwatchman and almost perishes first ball with a wild slash outside off stump. That is not in the job description. Nortje then gets one to rear up at 149kph that has Boland flinching with his gloves in front of his heart and fortunate to land away from the close catchers. A single tickled off his pads is greeted with rapturous applause around the Gabba. One over to go. Out of nothing, and with just eight minutes until stumps, Nortje gets one to nip back off the seam, through the gate, and into Steve Smith’s stumps. There was some inside-edge in the mix too, but that was top-quality fast bowling. Smith perhaps guilty of slowing his tempo a long way out from the close of play and eventually losing focus. 32nd over: Australia 144-3 (Smith 36, Head 78) Into the seventh over of his spell, and 11th of the session, Rabada sends down an unplayable delivery to Smith that hits a perfect length and jags past the outside edge. One of the best bowlers in the world is then bullied by Head who muscles a closed-face straight drive for four. This knock from the South Australian grows in stature by the minute. 31st over: Australia 137-3 (Smith 35, Head 72) The day’s play ebbs away as Australia eye the close and Nortje toils at two set batters. 30th over: Australia 136-3 (Smith 34, Head 72) Rabada surprises Head with a bumper to begin the over and the batter is slow to pick it up, only just ducking out of the way. There then follows four more dots with the bowler gaining the upper hand, and that induces a dubious shot from the final delivery, Head trying to cut very close to his body, but he gets away with it and earns four with a shot that travels through the outer angle of the minimally guarded cordon. 29th over: Australia 132-3 (Smith 34, Head 68) Nortje returns to the attack for a final dart as the shadows lengthen across the square. Head responds by whipping his wrists through the ball and back-cutting a length delivery for four. 28th over: Australia 127-3 (Smith 34, Head 63) Rabada continues to bend his back and he gets one to spit at Head, the first in a while that has arrived with menace. The left-hander doesn’t worry and calmly rotates the strike soon afterwards to bring up the 100 partnership. Smith is now so set he’s pulling out those exaggerated leaves that must infuriate pace bowlers. 27th over: Australia 126-3 (Smith 34, Head 62) The first heart-in-mouth moment for a while with Smith almost chopping Ngidi onto his stumps. He survives and Australia give the air of a side looking towards the close of play and the conclusion of a very very good day for them. 26th over: Australia 124-3 (Smith 32, Head 62) After a couple of slow overs and four dot balls from Rabada the match feels like it’s slipping into a holding pattern – then Head clubs a straight drive on the up to remind us of Australia’s ascendancy. This partnership has just about determined the outcome of the Test in half a session. 25th over: Australia 120-3 (Smith 32, Head 58) A lull in the action as Australia take stock and milk Ngidi for a chanceless couple of singles. 24th over: Australia 118-3 (Smith 31, Head 57) The Proteas are now unsure whether to attack or defend, which is Steve Smith’s happy place, allowing him to work the ball into gaps and sap the energy from Kagiso Rabada. “Just” three from the over but it’s hard to see anything other than this partnership filling its boots as the sun dips behind the Gabba grandstands. 23rd over: Australia 115-3 (Smith 28, Head 57) Ngidi returns but Head is so full of confidence it doesn’t matter who’s bowling to him. This time he throws his hands at a full delivery outside off and sends the ball rocketing to the extra-cover fence, then flicks an innocuous delivery off his hip all the way over the rope at backward square leg. That’s his 50 up from just 48 deliveries (and he was two from 16 before his first boundary). Still the runs flow with a third boundary of the over tickled down to fine-leg. South Africa are in a hole. 22nd over: Australia 100-3 (Smith 27, Head 43) Travis Head has become this match’s decisive actor. He arrived with Australia wobbling and his counterattack has turned the contest on its head. His fine touch continues with a clip for three over midwicket and a sweetly time pull for four. Rabada has lost his early zip. 21st over: Australia 92-3 (Smith 26, Head 36) Another boundary for Head as Australia’s counterattack threatens to get away from South Africa. Maharaj is trying to get through his work quickly and dry up this partnership but he is not finding anything like the turn or bounce that Lyon generated earlier, allowing Head to drill a muscular four through long-off. Plenty of good running around that stroke keeps the scoreboard moving at a brisk pace. 29,306 inside the Gabba today. 20th over: Australia 84-3 (Smith 25, Head 29) Another over, another boundary or two, this time Smith caressing the returning Rabada through the covers in elegant fashion, then Head picking up a delivery sliding onto his pads and lifting it over the infield with timing and confidence. This partnership has dragged the match firmly Australia’s way. 19th over: Australia 74-3 (Smith 20, Head 24) Time for the left-arm spin of Keshav Maharaj, but it’s easy pickings for Travis Head, who keeps the boundaries flowing, by easing the ball off his hip down to fine leg, then stepping deep in his crease and slapping a cut through the covers. Eamonn Maloney has emailed in questioning the balance of South Africa’s side. “Feels like maybe…too many good bowlers? Like to the point where you found it too hard to leave one out to add the extra batter you need? Or is there no such thing as team balance and 45 all out vs 57 all out means you chose the right side?” I’m conflicted. I like the bravery and boldness of it, but it will also look foolhardy at times – like today. It puts an awful lot of pressure on the attack and against the calibre of players like Smith and Labuschagne they’re not always going to come off. 18th over: Australia 65-3 (Smith 20, Head 15) South Africa must now be wondering if they have missed their Steve Smith window as the superstar begins Nortje’s latest over with a glorious pull shot that was four as soon as it left the bat. Another boundary later in the over comes with a straight bat, Smith drilling an overpitched delivery straight back down the ground with interest. Nortje responds by digging an effort ball into Smith’s midriff with stump mic picking up some chirp along the lines of “have some of that”. 17th over: Australia 57-3 (Smith 12, Head 15) The runs are flowing steadily now with Travis Head looking to score at every opportunity. He picks up four through wide mid-on when Jansen strays onto his pads, but he’s a bit streaky thereafter, fortunate to survive a squeezed inside-edge that almost dribbles into his pegs, then swishing and missing outside off. 16th over: Australia 53-3 (Smith 12, Head 11) Head rides the bounce after drinks to guide Nortje to fine-leg for a single then Smith cuts hard for only one run after some good work in the covers. South Africa need to rethink their length, and Nortje does just that after shifting from over to around the wicket, but Head is equal to it, driving on the up for three. More strike rotation singles follow as this partnership beds in. 15th over: Australia 46-3 (Smith 10, Head 6) Left-armer Jansen begins the 15th over by coming around the wicket to Smith, and it almost pays dividends when a yorker almost tailed in under Smith’s bat with the follow-up close to sneaking through the gate. Ball after ball Jansen is happy with his endeavour but finds his hands reaching for his head in frustration; welcome to bowling to Steve Smith Marco. Drinks. 14th over: Australia 46-3 (Smith 10, Head 6) Nortje continues his excellent spell, beating both batters with length deliveries. However, South Africa collectively are guilty of bowling a little too short and allowing Australia to defend from the crease, not drawing them forward into risk-reward strokes. That state of affairs is compounded by Nortje allowing Head room outside his off stump to convert a defensive push from the crease into a backfoot square drive for four. 13th over: Australia 40-3 (Smith 9, Head 2) Smith welcomes Jansen back to the crease by clipping the giant left-armer through wide mid-on for three. Both batters try to assert themselves and wrestle the momentum Australia’s way but it’s a difficult track on which to line anything up. 12th over: Australia 36-3 (Smith 6, Head 2) Nortje is bowling 140kph+ and hitting the deck hard. Head is trying to absorb the pace from the crease, accepting each defensive stroke like it’s a bomb detonating against his bat. Nortje then gets one to move a fraction and tickle the outside edge, but for the second time today the catch does not carry to second slip. This is one is much much closer than earlier with the ball hitting the turf inches from Elgar’s fingertips with the third umpire required to rubber stamp the soft signal on-field. Nortje keeps coming, pounding the ball into the Gabba deck and beating Head for pace. Nortje looks like has a bagful in him if he finds a slightly fuller length. 11th over: Australia 36-3 (Smith 6, Head 2) Elgar considers a review after Jansen raps Head full on the pads, but it looked to be just sliding down the legside with the left-arm pacer angling into the left-handed batter. Van der Dussen then commits a hilarious misfield to allow Head off strike. It should have been two in the end but Australia’s running was poor. Smith is untroubled playing from his crease and drives compactly through the covers to advance his tally by two. 10th over: Australia 33-3 (Smith 4, Head 1) Anrich Nortje is tasty! His first delivery to Travis Head is a bouncer that clears everyone on its way to the boundary for five wides. Head gets off strike, allowing Nortje to slide down a beautiful length delivery beyond the outside edge of Smith’s bat. 13 wickets in the day already and still plenty of overs to be bowled. Rabada struck with his first ball, so did Jansen, Nortje? He takes two deliveries to get into the action. His first ball was clipped sweetly for four off his hip by Khawaja, but the second spat violently off the surface to clip the shoulder of the bat and fly to the cordon where the sub Harmer dived away to his left at third slip to pouch a superb wicket. 9th over: Australia 23-2 (Khawaja 7, Smith 4) Jansen bowls a similar delivery first up to Smith, but the No 4 demonstrates that eerie ability to be in position almost before the ball has been bowled and caresses an all-run four through extra cover. That was ominous. Jansen is unfazed, ripping a fast off-cutter past the shoulder of Smith’s bat with plenty of bounce off a length , as you would expect from a 206cm paceman. Just like that, a bowling change earns a wicket! Marco Jansen’s opening delivery in Tests in Australia is a perfect full delivery from over the wicket, drawing Labuschagne forward and provoking an outside edge that carries to Elgar at second slip. Classic left-arm seam bowling. 8th over: Australia 18-1 (Khawaja 7, Labuschagne 11) Ngidi does get a fourth over, and it begins with Khawaja tipping and running to the non-striker’s end. The bowler’s length is too short to tempt a false stroke and eventually Labuschagne defends from the crease for a single. After that explosive start South Africa have allowed the game to meander in the afternoon sun. 7th over: Australia 16-1 (Khawaja 6, Labuschagne 10) Probing from Rabada but after Khawaja rotates the strike with a single Labuschagne defends well from the crease, accepting his job is to blunt the attack for the time being. 6th over: Australia 15-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 10) Ngidi fails to adjust his line to the right-hander and after firing one down the legside he coughs up two runs on Labuschagne’s pads. It’s far from express pace at 127kph and he looks to be carrying a slight limp as he ambles back to his mark. He’s showing no sign of coming out of the attack, but he may not be fully fit. Ngidi continues his work, bustling in over the wicket, and he beats the batter’s inside edge and appeals for LBW. It’s declined on-field but Elgar sends the REVIEW to the third umpire. It looked hopeful, striking Labuschagne above the knee roll, and DRS confirms the ball was tracking miles over the bails. Not sure I’d give Ngidi a fourth over with this new ball considering the firepower elsewhere in the attack. 5th over: Australia 13-1 (Khawaja 5, Labuschagne 8) Rabada begins his assault at Khawaja by trying to go short, but there isn’t enough pace or bounce and the home track hero pulls elegantly for four. The left-hander then leaves smartly or defends calmly from the crease as Rabada’s rhythm deserts him. 4th over: Australia 9-1 (Khawaja 1, Labuschagne 8) Ngidi is honing in on Khawaja’s off stump and after that pair share 11 dot balls, the run is halted when a closed face defensive push trickles into the on-side and Labuschagne calls his partner through for a single. Now, what can Rabada do against Khawaja? 3rd over: Australia 8-1 (Khawaja 0, Labuschagne 8) Nearly another for Rabada! He draws the edge from Labuschagne but the ball arrives at second slip on the half volley. This is a proper contest and South Africa have a window tonight to put Australia under an awful lot of pressure. 2nd over: Australia 8-1 (Khawaja 0, Labuschagne 8) Ngidi shares the new ball, bowling around the wicket to Khawaja, trying to shape the ball away from the bat. After a couple of looseners he finds his range, getting some lift out of the surface. Both protagonists are happy to share a maiden. 1st over: Australia 8-1 (Khawaja 0, Labuschagne 8) Incredible start for South Africa and Rabada. That was clearly a plan to Warner and the veteran was not expecting it. His lean run continues. Labuschagne gets the scoreboard moving with an inside-edge that scuttles down to the fine leg fence. Then he profits from an outside edge to double the total. Maybe 152 was par after all? FIRST BALL! Vicious lifter from Rabada bowling over the wicket towards the armpit of Warner. The under-pressure opener could only fend with his bottom hand off the bat and the ball looped towards short-leg where Zondo made a superb catch leaping to take the ball one-handed over his head. What a start! Usman Khawaja and David Warner are out to begin Australia’s reply. Kagiso Rabada has the ball… “Arriving in Australia not having a batter averaging 40 is a scary situation,” bemoans Graeme Smith at the tea break. It’s hard to see that situation changing this series after that effort. The pitch is sporting, Australia’s attack bowled reasonably, but that is a desperate batting performance. Bavuma and Verreynne shared a stand of 98, the next highest partnership was 15. A lot of pressure now on the vaunted bowling attack to keep this Test alive. Into the deck from Cummins, Ngidi backs away and his angled bat deflects the ball straight to Cameron Green in the gully. South Africa’s first innings ends in the 49th over. 48th over: South Africa 152-9 (Rabada 10, Ngidi 3) Rabada tries to reverse sweep Nathan Lyon, gets into an ugly tangle and is given out LBW. A quick REVIEW shows the ball struck the underside of the glove first and the South African is reprieved. The tailender then goes the tonk but mistimes a slog that only just evades the fingertips of the back-pedalling Mitchell Starc behind point. Ngidi is then fortunate to beat a diving fielder, Green on this occasion, as he tries to force Lyon through the on-side. 47th over: South Africa 148-9 (Rabada 7, Ngidi 2) Cummins replaces Starc and immediately invites Rabada to fend off a delivery heading into the left-hander’s ribs from around the wicket. Ngidi then defends from the crease, stepping to leg a fraction to show the full surface area of all three stumps. That movement is exaggerated next ball and it seems only a matter of time before the No 1 ranked bowler in Test cricket lands one full and straight and clatters the timber, but instead he fizzes a couple past the outside edge and wastes a bouncer. 46th over: South Africa 147-9 (Rabada 6, Ngidi 2) Lungi Ngidi averages four in Test cricket, and he gets halfway there with a thick outside edge that runs along the ground through gully. Lyon responds with a delivery that bounces prodigiously, with no shortage of turn into the right-hander. Gabba line, Gabba length, Gabba bounce, for Nathan Lyon, and it’s too good for Nortje who tries to get in behind and play down the line, but the ball cannons off the glove within reach of short-leg diving onto the track. 45th over: South Africa 145-8 (Rabada 6, Nortje 0) Rabada edges in front of second slip, then wafts at the chemtrails of a Starc thunderbolt. The South African then gets in an awkward position to hook and is fortunate not to glove behind. Australia think he has and REVIEW but DRS quickly determines there was no deflection. Searching for his 300th, Starc overpitches and Rabada retains the presence of mind to punish a crisp cover drive for a rare boundary. 44th over: South Africa 141-8 (Rabada 2, Nortje 0) Nortje props onto his front foot and dabs away a maiden from Nathan Lon. Lyon, by the way, is now the leading Test wicket-taker for 2022, with 41, ahead of England’s Stuart Broad (40) and Jack Leach (39). 43rd over: South Africa 141-8 (Rabada 2, Nortje 0) This is all getting very Sydney Thunder. Rabada should be Starc’s 300th but Head could not hold on at short-leg after the ball was pushed into his midriff only to pop out away from his grasp. Cricket Australia’s hierarchy must be getting on the phone to the MCG and SCG curators demanding some CEO pitches for the remainder of the series because it’s hard to see how the Proteas are ever going to put up a competitive total with this line-up. Starc now has 299 Test wickets at a tick over 27. Lyon is now up to 452 at 31.66 after another regulation edge to the safe hands of Steve Smith. Verreynne batted very well for his 64, but the lack of support around him has been alarming. 42nd over: South Africa 139-8 (Rabada 0) For the fourth over in a row Verreynne takes an early single, exposing the weaker batter to the majority of the bowling. Starc steams in from around the wicket and after Maharaj squirts a couple down to third, he’s late on a full delivery and edges a regulation catch to Smith at second slip. South Africa need to revisit their selection policy in Melbourne. 41st over: South Africa 135-7 (Verreynne 63) 40th over: South Africa 132-6 (Verreynne 63, Maharaj 0) Keshav Maharaj is out in the middle. Kyle Verreynne must hope he can hold up an end while he keeps the scoreboard ticking over. Yeah, Marco Jansen is not a Test No 7. Treading water on two from 18 he launches a mow at Lyon, managing only to sky a top edge that Cameron Green does very well indeed to pouch at midwicket, following the ball into hands from high in the sky over his shoulder and into his mitts. Decent pressure bowling since drinks from Australia, but that was a poor dismissal. 39th over: South Africa 131-5 (Verreynne 62, Jansen 2) Verreyne gets off strike with an easy single, which won’t upset Starc one jot. He shows why immediately, beating Jansen for pace and bounce outside his off stump. The giant South African looks an unconvincing Test #7 when placed against the calibre of lower-middle order batters in the modern game. Starc wastes his next three deliveries then switches from over to around the wicket, bowling full and straight, but Jansen is ready for it. I would plan for day three, and then you can always go on day four too if you feel like it. There will definitely be walk-up tickets. 38th over: South Africa 130-5 (Verreyne 61, Jansen 2) Lyon continues with his line outside the off stump to the two right handers. There’s typical Gabba bounce, but the turn is slow. Verreyne has his eye in and uses his feet to milk a single. Jansen, not so much, but gets his telescopic front pad outside the line to minimise risk. Thank you very much Geoff, although I’m not sure I’ll be excellent company today. I am tired and grumpy, and not a little hungover. Bah humbug. Readers out there, don’t forget to readjust your email and Twitter radars for all your correspondence. 37th over: South Africa 129-5 (Verreyne 60, Jansen 2) Decent front foot defence by Jansen against Starc, scoring a run into the covers after blocking a couple. Goes back slightly as the bowler arrives, getting low into a crouch so that his height doesn’t have him too far from the ball. He gets safely to drinks, which means that it is time for me to get out of here, and to leave you in the excellent company of Jonathan Partridge Howcroft. 36th over: South Africa 127-5 (Verreyne 59, Jansen 1) Nathan Lyon is back, to bowl only his second over of the day and probably hoping to get a third immediately after it. Verreyne tucks away a single, Jansen reaches out and gets a soft edge into the ground for his first run. 35th over: South Africa 125-5 (Verreyne 58, Jansen 0) Talk about adjusting the radar for Mitchell Starc. He goes from bowling to Bavuma, at 162 centimetres, to Marco Jansen at 207. Long, lean, lanky, stooping down over his bat like a Tim Burton animation. His first few balls he leaves Starc alone outside the line of the stumps. Bowled! Mitchell Starc goes through Bavuma. Forward defensive shot, a bit of swing into him, almost through the gate, it would have missed off stump had it gone through cleanly, but it clips the inside edge of his bat. Back onto his leg stump. Beaten by movement and pace. Lovely bit of bowling and it brings success. A 98-run partnership comes to an end. 34th over: South Africa 123-4 (Bavuma 36, Verreyne 58) Three slips at last. Khawaja comes in to third, Smith second, Warner first. Green in the gully, Lyon at point. But Khawaja ends up at mid off when Verreyne comes onto strike via a Bavuma drive for three. And when Bavuma gets the strike back, the third slip stays gone and he has two out for the short ball, which Boland balls. This all seems a bit confused. Boland gets wided! Bavuma is about five foot tall, so it’s an easy mistake to make. And another single to follow. Six runs from a Boland over. That is heresy. 33rd over: South Africa 117-4 (Bavuma 32, Verreyne 57) Thrashed through the covers! Bavuma this time, getting enthused by what his batting partner is doing. That was Mitchell Starc’s first ball of a new spell. Follows it up by taking a run after hitting straight at Cummins at mid on, who tries a cute flick between his ankles towards the stumps rather than picking up the cricket ball. 32nd over: South Africa 112-4 (Bavuma 27, Verreyne 57) Another four through the cordon for Verreyne! Deliberate enough, reaches for it. Two slips, gully, backward point. I still think they could have another slip there. As we speak, Green has come a little finer, and Lyon at point a little further behind it. Boland is having to do some grunt work now, keeps a lid on things for the next five balls. 31st over: South Africa 108-4 (Bavuma 27, Verreyne 53) Climbs into it! Short form Cummins and Verreyne really muscles a pull shot, hitting it high over midwicket rather than using the pace behind square. Lots of empty grass out there, safe shot. It raises his milestone with a four. He’s made one Test century, no other score about 39 until today, in his 19th innings. Got his career average above 30 as of right now. Averages over 50 in first-class cricket, it’s worth noting. 30th over: South Africa 103-4 (Bavuma 27, Verreyne 48) Bavuma facing Boland, beaten on the outside edge with the first ball, then plays his first really expansive shot as he chases a cover drive, not quite nailing it so he gets three rather than four. 25 minutes into the second session, and we’ve finished the 30 overs that we should have had in the first. 29th over: South Africa 99-4 (Bavuma 24, Verreyne 47) On he goes! Kyle Verreyne, that is. First ball of the Cummins over, smacks it over backward point for four. Then climbs into a pull shot, with two catchers in the deep, but it’s along the ground for a single. Bavuma jumps and takes a run off his hip. He’s playing his part in the pairing well. Stubborn player. Made runs against Australia in 2018, got stranded just short of a hundred in Johannesburg when he ran out of partners. 28th over: South Africa 93-4 (Bavuma 23, Verreyne 42) A watchful start from Verreyne in the Boland over, before trying a cut shot that gets stopped, then an on-drive that gets him a run. Verreyne still striking at 75 runs per 100 balls, that’s a good clip in the circumstances. 27th over: South Africa 92-4 (Bavuma 23, Verreyne 41) A fall for Cummins! Gets into his delivery stride and his back foot slips along the surface and straight out from under him. The crowd gasps as he goes down, but he’s straight back up. Lucky not to roll an ankle there as it folded under him. He’s a little tentative bowling the next ball, down in the 120s for speed. Gets back into the 130s thereafter. And nearly gets Verreyne! Cutting in off the seam, just over the stumps as the batter leaves. He’s not bothered though, getting forward to the next ball and again playing that shot with an open blade that has returned him a lot of runs in this innings. Three more to backward point. Bavuma is hit on the thigh pad, via an inside edge says the umpire, and collects two. 26th over: South Africa 87-4 (Bavuma 21, Verreyne 38) Back after lunch, and it’s a change of ends for Boland, operating with Stanley Street at his back as Cummins did during the first session. Verreyne is prepared to be positive straight away, getting forward to drive the first ball through the covers and race back for three. Bavuma sees out the rest, mostly leaving. Something of a recovery for South Africa, after being asked to bat and then reduced to 27 for 4. Bavuma and Verreyne, mostly the latter, peeled off 45 runs in the last 11 overs of the session. They’re still in real trouble though – if one of these two gets out in the next session then you’d suspect Australia will wrap them up for under 200. The fightback must continue. Scott Boland Average Watch: 9.86. 25th over: South Africa 84-4 (Bavuma 21, Verreyne 35) Not going into his shell just before lunch, Verreyne. Gets the strike from Bavuma, then reaches for a square drive and it’s another one that teases Marnus all the way to the rope, where again he dives and taps back but this time the batters spare him the indignity of running four while he does it. He had support from Lyon on that occasion, which sped up the ball’s return. Bavuma gets short width from Starc a couple of times which makes it easy to let go. That’s lunch! 24th over: South Africa 80-4 (Bavuma 20, Verreyne 32) Here comes Lyon after a long wait. Lunch is looming, probably just the one over for him. He’s bowling from the Stanley Street End, and Verreyne pulls out a reverse sweep third ball! Middles it through backward point. Then a quarter chance as he clips the ball to the other side of the wicket and it strikes Labuschagne on the shin pad fielding at short leg. 23rd over: South Africa 76-4 (Bavuma 20, Verreyne 28) Bavuma staying positive against Starc, hopping as he squeezes a ball down into the cordon, then driving through the covers for a couple. Odd that the Australians don’t have more slips in. Both batters keep looking to drive, they’re not scoring a torrent of runs to cover while doing so, and there goes another edge for four, this time off Bavuma. 22nd over: South Africa 70-4 (Bavuma 14, Verreyne 28) This batting pair keep playing to their strengths. Bavuma scampers a single, Verreyne reaches out and guides four runs between gully and slip. He’s counterattacked well, taking on Cummins. “Just tuning in from Salvador in Bahia,” writes Cressida Evans, lamenting the number of South African wickets. “Any case, just saying checking in to say I’m keeping you company and thank you, as ever, for The Final Word with that there Mr Collins. Abraços and all that stuff.” Our pleasure. Nothing beats a good abraço – that’s a hug, for our non-Portuguese speakers. 21st over: South Africa 65-4 (Bavuma 13, Verreyne 24) Mitchell Starc is back. Another near run out! This pair have real problems, third time and still lucky. Verreyne plays to square leg, comes down as Bavuma starts, gets sent back, and his feet slip from under him as he tries to turn. Travis Head with one stump to aim at misses, but he had so much time. Could have run a couple of paces closer, or perhaps even Carey could have charged in to the stumps had he been sharper about it. I suspect maybe he hung back because he saw Head lining up for his hardest possible throw. He wouldn’t have reached the stumps but he might have got within a few yards for a relay throw. Verreyne survives, and gets a freebie from Starc outside leg stump that he clips away fine for four. 20th over: South Africa 61-4 (Bavuma 13, Verreyne 20) Shot, Bavuma! Gets width from Cummins, rocks back and slays the cut shot behind point. Punch and counterpunch, as Cummins follows up with an unplayable that goes past the outside edge, Bavuma in about six minds as to how to play it. Bavuma tries coming across the crease just a little so he can play Cummins to the leg side, and scurries through for a single. Verreyne does similarly. 19th over: South Africa 55-4 (Bavuma 8, Verreyne 19) Boland still jagging it all over the place off the seam. Whacks Bavuma on the body as it decks in, then Bavuma almost plays another drive but bails out and leaves the ball alone. Gets a single eventually off an inside edge. 18th over: South Africa 54-4 (Bavuma 7, Verreyne 19) Bizarre bit of fielding from Labuschagne! Grabs the ball at cover, then throws it into a huge vacant gap at midwicket and gives away another run. Lost his bearings completely. That doesn’t help Green, who then bowls a half-decent ball outside off stump, but Verreyne plays it deftly with an open face through deep third for four. 17th over: South Africa 47-4 (Bavuma 6, Verreyne 13) They’re scoring runs from Boland! Unthinkable. Singles, using the gap at cover to defend balls into before dashing off. But then, growing in confidence, Bavuma throws his hands at a drive and nearly nicks it. 16th over: South Africa 44-4 (Bavuma 4, Verreyne 12) A tidier over from Green for his second effort, a couple of singles from it but he’s not trying the bumper length anymore. “Thought you might like to know that Brisbane is not in the tropics. I live in Townsville. Brisbane is the temperate south.” Thanks Matt Power – but if any shampoo with coconut scent in it can be called tropical, then I’m calling any place warm and full of palm trees tropical too. 15th over: South Africa 41-4 (Bavuma 3, Verreyne 11) A short leg in for Boland, as well as three slips and a gully. Bavuma knocks a single to the off side. Verreyne has a ball cut him in half, jagging back massively but going over the stumps. You can never rest against Boland when he’s in this groove. 14th over: South Africa 40-4 (Bavuma 2, Verreyne 11) Cameron Green into the attack rather than Nathan Lyon. Tries a short-ball approach, and Verreyne decides to take him on. Stays back and punts him over midwicket first, then reaches out and slashes over backward point! That carries all the way for six! Extraordinary shot, to get the power on it from that position. Suddenly Verreyne has 11 at a run a ball, where everyone else has struggled. Green gets better after that, bowling in the channel and having Verreyne playing unconvincingly. This was prescient from Abhishek Chopra half an hour ago: “Maybe there’s still time for a quick introduction of Boland into the attack - movement at slightly lower speeds can be a handful on this track.” 13th over: South Africa 29-4 (Bavuma 1, Verreyne 1) Scott Boland bowls an over that, weirdly, doesn’t take a wicket. Not sure what happened there. Scott Boland facts (as of before this over). 12th over: South Africa 29-4 (Bavuma 1, Verreyne 1) Nearly a run out! As Bavuma gets off the mark to backward point, there was a miscommunication with the batters, they bail out of the run, and Verreyne would have been gone if Lyon’s throw had gone to his end. Bavuma might have been gone too had the throw hit the striker’s stumps. It misses and they get an overthrow. Then another close one as Verreyne calls Bavuma through for a sharp single, Bavuma sliding into his ground at the striker’s end. 11th over: South Africa 27-4 (Bavuma 0, Verreyne 0) Boland gets his career bowling average back down into single figures. Currently 9.65, with 23 wickets in his fifth Test. He is unstoppable! Why take one wicket in an over when you take more? The Scott Boland method. Runs in, hits an off-stump line, moves the ball in a fraction, smashes Zondo on the knee roll, playing back. Zondo reviews but he’s not very tall, so that ball is hitting a fair bit of the bails over the top of middle stump. South Africa reeling! Scotty Boland! You cannot keep him out of a game. Imposing figure with his broad shoulders and his big frame, thundering in with heavy footfalls. He hits a spot outside the left-hander’s off stump, gets left alone, and gradually works closer to that off stump with the next three deliveries. Fourth of the over, Erwee has to play given the line, skews it away off the edge, and Green uses his entire eight-foot frame to lunge away in the gully and snaffle it. 10th over: South Africa 27-2 (Erwee 10, Bavuma 0) Another belter from Cummins to follow, beating Bavuma’s edge. Has to adjust the length slightly given Bavuma’s shorter stature. An awkward leading edge follows, Bavuma twisting his body while defending and seeing the ball end up at cover. Steps into a drive, Bavuma, but can’t beat mid off. Another snorter from Cummins to finish, takes off from back of a length and then flies past the edge into Carey’s gloves. There’s the right length from Cummins! His classic range, on a line of about three and a half stumps, a length to draw the batter forward while still leaving time to move away, and enough movement off the deck to take the edge. Click. 9th over: South Africa 27-1 (Erwee 10, van der Dussen 5) Solo at the Bolo! Here comes Scott Boland, with a huge ovation from the crowd as he is announced. And he has the rare experience of being driven for a boundary, Erwee driving straight from a fuller ball. The rest of the over is classic Boland though, testing them out on a good length. 8th over: South Africa 22-1 (Erwee 6, van der Dussen 4) Cummins again. How long will the opening spells be? Stanley Street End for the captain, who drops it back of a length to Erwee, defending up on his toes. Past the outside edge the next ball, Erwee dragging the bat inside the line, but the ball was a touch too short and thus doesn’t take the edge. Then a very tight leave, Erwee letting the ball go over his off bail, but again the length isn’t full enough. Easy to point out, hard to get right, as Cummins gets a touch too full from the last two balls and is driven. The first is saved at mid on, the second is not, and Erwee gets his first boundary! 7th over: South Africa 18-1 (Erwee 2, van der Dussen 4) Starc bowls wide of Erwee, then too straight and nudged square for another single. SA’s score has been progressing at a crawl, but Starc despite the wicket has produced a spell that has never looked threatening. Top shot from van der Dussen to follow, overpitched and allowing him to stop the bat dead after the most understated off drive, pushing forward, and it is timed so nicely that is speeds to the rope. Labuschagne puts in a great chase, a great dive, a tap back to save the boundary… and the batters run four anyway. 6th over: South Africa 13-1 (Erwee 1, van der Dussen 0) A brute from Cummins! First really good delivery of the innings, it spits off a length and zips past the outside edge as Erwee responds with a movement that is more flinch than stroke. Four balls into the over, Erwee gets forward and pushes a single to cover, finally off the mark. 5th over: South Africa 12-1 (Erwee 0, van der Dussen 0) Success for Starc to start the over outside the left-hander’s leg stump, then he repeatedly hangs the ball way outside the right-hander’s off stump after Rassie van der Dussen comes in. Doesn’t make him play. Ohhh, trouble for the visitors. That’s the shot that looked risky in Starc’s previous over, when Elgar poked down the leg side away from his body. He does the same this time, reaching for that line, off balance trying to catch up to the ball, and only succeeds in touching it through to the wicketkeeper. 4th over: South Africa 12-0 (Elgar 3, Erwee 0) A maiden from Cummins to Erwee, with the bowler getting the radar back on. 3rd over: South Africa 12-0 (Elgar 3, Erwee 0) There’s a half-hearted invocation of the third umpire to start the over, as Elgar squeezes a bump ball from the toe of his bat into the ground and then to slip. The Australians appeal so the umpires have to have a look, though the soft signal is not out. Elgar misses a prod down the leg side, then presses a couple of runs through cover point off the front foot. Runs off the bat add to their tally of… one. 2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (Elgar 1, Erwee 0) Pat Cummins with the new ball, something that doesn’t always happen when Hazlewood is in the side, and he’s off-line to Erwee to begin with. It flicks the thigh pad and runs away for four leg byes. Second ball? Same result! Back of a length and angling down from a right-arm line around the wicket. Erwee stands upright in his stance, high backlift, and after those false starts Cummins gets the line right, the right-hander leaving and defending the rest of the over. Nine runs out of ten for extras so far. 1st over: South Africa 2-0 (Elgar 1, Erwee 0) We’re away, with Mitchell Starc from the Vulture Street end, and Elgar shifts across his crease to stab the ball away from just outside off stump. Less dramatic than Starc’s first ball of last year’s Test, the one that destroyed Rory Burns’ off stump. So much for South Africa rests on Elgar getting them through the early overs. He blocks the next ball, then knocks a single to fine leg. Erwee is another left-hander, and he gets a short enough length to knock the ball off his hip, saved at midwicket by Head. Only from the final ball does Starc throw in that full swinging delivery, and it takes out Erwee’s leg. Knocks him over completely, after pitching outside the line of leg stump, and he gets a leg bye. The skies have changed quickly this morning. Blue when I arrived, overcast when Cummins won the toss, now the sun is breaking through again. Things move fast in the tropics. The national anthems round out the formalities. Both teams on the field, as per tradition, with large flags held parallel to the ground behind them. The reserve players and support staff ring the boundary, standing to attention with hands behind their backs as they have done for the duration. The Welcome to Country is performed by Aunty Deb Sandy of the Yuggerah people, who asks everyone in the crowd to call out their names so that she can welcome them properly. A nice addition that I haven’t seen before. She also sends out condolences to the Wieambilla victims. The ceremonial proceedings are about to get underway. There’s a ground-wide round of applause as a tribute to the two police officers who were killed not far from Brisbane earlier this week. It goes on over James Sherry’s attempts to resume speaking. There are representatives of the forces on the ground with him, and a minute’s silence follows as people remove their hats in a poignantly old-fashioned gesture. As expected. South Africa go with the keeper at six and five bowlers, the first three of whom can bat decently. Australia go as unchanged as possible, with only Cummins returning for Michael Neser, and Boland retaining his position as first option off the bench. South Africa Dean Elgar * Sarel Erwee Rassie van der Dussen Temba Bavuma Khaya Zondo Kyle Verreynne + Marco Jansen Keshav Maharaj Kagiso Rabada Anrich Nortje Lungi Ngidi Australia David Warner Usman Khawaja Marnus Labuschagne Steven Smith Travis Head Cameron Green Alex Carey + Pat Cummins * Mitchell Starc Nathan Lyon Scott Boland Innnteresting! Cummins must be thinking of putting England under the cosh on the opening morning last year. The pitch is very green, but it often is at the Gabba without providing much meaningful assistance. Still, SA have a sketchy batting line-up so maybe Australia can make inroads anyway. Batting second is historically not an impediment at the Gabba. If you want a preview of today’s match and the series to come, here’s one I prepared earlier. What’s happening in the middle? The South Africans have just finished an all-in game of some variety of volleyball, and now they’re doing ground fielding drills, running in to pick up balls being pinged at them along the turf. The Australians are more spread out: Smith and Khawaja doing slip catching, Starc and Green going through their run-ups, players throwing medicine balls or chatting to commentators. Mark Nicholas is back out on an Australian Test ground after those years with Nine, must be doing commentary for SuperSport I’m guessing. Pat Cummins has just left the field to get changed for the toss. My name is Geoff, I’m at the ground keeping my eyes open for anything interesting. You can get in touch by emailing geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or (while it lasts) on Twitter at @GeoffLemonSport. Good morning from Brisbane. The sun is shining, the palms are swaying, the sky is paradise blue. It is a million miles away from the lead-up to the Ashes Test a year ago, when it rained Biblically for two weeks straight and I was starting to pair off lemurs and marmosets just in case. It is also very mild for Brisbane, which in summer usually has the heat and overwhelming humid of an armpit. I' am not a meteorologist, but presumably the cool summer system that has made the southern states into a frigid hellscape for the past few weeks has also had a gentling effect on the north, because nothing all week is forecast to get above the high 20s in temperature, and the humidity is relatively low. That is the setting of the scene, if you’re watching along on television or reading along while doing other things, and wanting to know what the players are feeling. Which players? Those of Australia and South Africa, one of the strong rivalries in the small world of Test cricket, in their first series since the sandpaper business in 2018. Nobody remembers that, surely? It’s not like it has been in the news ever since."
"Capuozzo’s moment of magic Italy arrived in Cardiff on the back of 36 consecutive defeats in the Six Nations and though Wales had hardly had a championship to remember – a disappointing defence of their title – given the Azzurri’s tendency to get worse as the tournament goes on they were given little hope of breaking their seven-year duck. They were heading for another gallant defeat when Josh Adams went over after 68 minutes, but with less than two minutes to go Edoardo Padovani gathered Kieran Hardy’s overhit box-kick and passed inside to Ange Capuozzo. The full-back, then 22, cemented his burgeoning reputation with a dazzling run, through Adams, then twisted Hardy inside out and delivered the pass to Padovani to score. Paolo Garbisi nailed the conversion to seal a magnificent victory. Italy built on it by defeating Australia this autumn, adding further intrigue to next year’s tournament, with a home match against France kicking off their campaign. Raynal’s whistle does the talking Recent history suggests there is nothing unusual about New Zealand romping clear of Australia in the third quarter but, as was shown throughout the year, the All Blacks are susceptible to late rallies and so it was in Melbourne with a Nic White penalty edging the Wallabies, who had been 18 points down, ahead. The All Blacks shifted into another gear and pressed for the winning score but a penalty for Australia near their own line with around 90 seconds to play seemed to be decisive. That was until the referee, Mathieu Raynal, who had grown increasingly fed up throughout the match, pinged Bernard Foley for time-wasting and awarded New Zealand a scrum from which Jordie Barrett scored the matchwinning try. To some Raynal – who has consistently stood by his decision – was right to call up Foley, to others it was a dangerous precedent and questionable timing considering there are plenty of occasions calls like that could be made in most matches. World Rugby’s recent directives designed to speed up the game suggest we will see more of it in the buildup to – and during – next year’s World Cup. That doesn’t make it any easier for the Wallabies to stomach, however. A shootout for the ages As much as the Champions Cup is floundering at the moment, it is worth bearing in mind that last season’s competition looked, for long spells, unlikely to be completed due to Covid, before springing into life in a captivating knockout phase. None more so than Toulouse’s trip to Dublin to face Munster in the quarter-finals and a first penalty shootout since 2009. The 80-minute contest wasn’t bad in its own right but the tension went up several notches in a scoreless period of extra time before the thrilling denouement. They are so rare that broadcasters and spectators alike were not entirely sure of the format – indeed Romain Ntamack celebrated ahead of schedule when scoring Toulouse’s third kick – but it was one of those moments that captured the attention of those with barely a passing interest in the sport. We are told often enough by administrators of the club game that is the holy grail so maybe we should see extra time done away with and shootouts take place a little more often. The steal that stole the Rugby World Cup In a final between favourites England and the host Black Ferns that pretty much had it all – breathtaking tries, an audacious off the floor offload to seize the lead following a scintillating comeback and a world record crowd for a women’s rugby match – in the end, the game was won on the last play. England’s lineout had dominated throughout the Rugby World Cup, their go-to catch and drive generating countless scores, including in the Eden Park finale, but at the very last, they were outplayed. Trailing by three points having played for 60 minutes with 14 after Lydia Thompson’s red, England won a lineout on the New Zealand five-metre line. As they lined up for what should have been yet another scoring opportunity, the Black Ferns read the call, Joanah Ngan-Woo leapt and stole back possession in front of Abbie Ward, and took the cup away from Sarah Hunter’s side. In the end, someone had to lose, but the Black Ferns’ victory, based on freedom and fun and supported across the nation, meant that really, the winner was as much the women’s game. Fan power sees off Jones Arguably the most significant moment of the year was when boos echoed around Twickenham at the final whistle of England’s limp defeat by South Africa because for all that Bill Sweeney had endorsed Eddie Jones’s World Cup masterplan through two dreadful Six Nations campaigns, supporters making their views so clear forced him to act. Sweeney insists the decision was purely results-based and as much as that rings true, you suspect Jones’s comments about private schools over the summer particularly stung the debenture holders the RFU so cherishes. Jones’s biggest strength at the start of his tenure was the clarity he brought to what was by and large Stuart Lancaster’s squad, but by the end there was a fog of confusion around his setup. He maintains he could have lifted it in the buildup to France 2023 but he was denied the chance to have another crack at the trophy he so covets. Steve Borthwick will bring the usual bounce next year but the jury remains out on whether he can succeed where Jones narrowly failed."
"Ben Stokes has challenged his England players to turn their tour of Pakistan into a historic clean sweep as he and Brendon McCullum ponder a debut for the 18-year-old Rehan Ahmed. Sitting 2-0 up with one Test to play going into the final instalment that starts in Karachi on Saturday – and on a run of eight wins from their past nine matches – England could become the first visitors to the country to record three Test victories in a series. Citing the example of England’s 3-0 win in Sri Lanka in 2018, Stokes said: “We won that series before the last Test and there was even more put on to it, knowing that we could become the only English team to register a whitewash in Sri Lanka. “So although the series here is done and we’ll still lift the trophy at the end regardless of the result, there’s still an extra bit knowing that we could be one of the very few teams that could walk away from Pakistan with a whitewash series. “We’ve got some big challenges after the new year, with a tour of New Zealand and then the big one with the Ashes. But 2022 has been one to look back on with very good memories. I’ve really enjoyed it.” England’s dominant position this week brings with it the possibility of handing Ahmed his first Test cap, a move which would make the leg-spinner – 18 years and 126 days old on day one – England’s youngest Test cricketer, breaking the record held by Brian Close (18 years and 149 days against New Zealand in 1949). While Stokes was intending to make a late call on his final selection of the year, as he and the head coach assess conditions at the National Stadium, the captain stressed that, if Ahmed was picked, it would be because he is deemed ready. Stokes said: “I don’t think it would be a case of giving caps away. We picked Rehan in the squad not just because of his talent and to integrate him, but because it would be a good opportunity to play him if we thought it was necessary. “I’m struggling to work out what he is, whether he’s a batter or a leg-spinner, which is good I guess, because it shows how much talent he’s got. “Having a wrist-spinner is always exciting, especially for England, but it’s not getting too carried away with the potential that he has. Because he is only young, and you’ve still got to nurture talent, no matter how exciting it is.” Stokes, once dismissed by Ahmed in the nets when the spinner was 11 years old, believes it would also send a message to young players from the British Asian community at a time when the sport’s inclusive credentials remain under the microscope. “I have always felt cricket is a very inclusive sport,” Stokes said. “Certainly during my time in the England team, you have been selected on your skills as a cricketer first and foremost and that still should be the way going forward. “Rehan, he could be an unbelievable example to set for younger kids who want to come up. They may have maybe heard about what’s happened in cricket recently [but] he can be seen as ‘we’ve got this 18-year-old, hopefully a potential superstar, why can’t I be that?’”"
"Joe Marler could find himself in hot water with the Rugby Football Union after appearing to spark an ugly brawl in Harlequins’ defeat against Bristol on Tuesday. Marler seemed to bait the Bristol flanker Jake Heenan with an alleged comment that provoked a reaction from the New Zealander and could face further action. The Bristol director of rugby, Pat Lam, said the Bears would not be making an official complaint about the incident but Marler could still be hauled in front of the RFU if the incident is included in the referee’s report or should the citing commissioner consider it something worth pursuing. The Harlequins head coach, Tabai Matson, said he was not aware of the comment but conceded Marler can be “antagonistic”. Lam pointed to how he had never seen Heenan react in that manner, questioning whether the incident was in the spirit of the game. He said: “I love Joe Marler, I brought Jake over from New Zealand to Connacht and to here, he is like a son to our family and I have never seen him like that. It is best to say one of the areas we are all trying to work on is the spirit of the game. Something was said and there was a reaction from Jake I have never seen before. “We are all custodians of the game – players, coaches – and one thing we all value and we all work hard to keep is the right values and spirit. He reacted to something that was said. That is what I know happened. I will leave that to other people, we will just crack on.” The incident took place in the first half as both sides were preparing for a scrum. Marler appeared to make a comment which Heenan reacted to before a melee broke out between both sets of forwards. “He does tease people [but] I’m not sure [what was said],” Matson said. “I’m just commenting on what I saw from the sideline. I don’t know what was said but he’s quite antagonistic. He’s had to play against and I thought [the referee Karl Dickson] handled it well.”"
"Here’s Ali Martin’s report from Karachi: Rehan Ahmed speaks I found out the day before the game. Stokes called me to his room with Baz, and told me I was making my debut. I couldn’t sleep last night – couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. It was a big day for my family. [My dad] loved cricket himself, and he backed us all the way – late nights, early mornings, he was always there. I was very nervous before the first ball. But it was a great feeling. I rushed a little bit in my first spell, though it came out better than I expected. Stokesy was like, ‘I don’t care about the runs, just get me a wicket’. In the second spell I stopped worrying about the runs. [On his first wicket] I’ve been bowling at left-handers all my life as my brother is left-handed. That’s what I always did to him: bowl a googly, then bowl a legspinner and hope he nicks it! When I first started I could only bowl googlies, so I’m still in the process of learning the art of the legspinner. [On his second wicket] I just love bowling the googly! It’s a great wicket-taking option. I’ve got years to [develop the legspinner]. I’ve been working on it here [with Jeetan Patel] and I think I’m in a better position than I was before I came here. [Did you ever think you weren’t ready for Test cricket?] Nah, no. The way Baz and Stokesy backed me was all I needed to know. That’s the end of another entertaining day’s play. Even on a very slow pitch, there were 11 wickets and 311 runs. England had the better of the day, yet Pakistan are probably on top because of the advantage of batting first on a turning pitch. Babar Azam top-scored with an apparently effortless 78 before being run out. England’s spinners shared seven wickets, including two for the teenage debutant Rehan Ahmed. He had a fine day, with both wickets coming from excellent bowling rather than batsman error. 3rd over: England 7-1 (Duckett 4, Pope 3) Duckett works Abrar just wide of short leg for a single. It was in the air and almost a chance for Abdullah Shafique; file under ‘they either stick or they don’t’. The last ball of the day brings another big appeal for LBW, this time against Duckett. Babar goes for the review. Duckett missed a sweep and was hit on the side in front of off and middle stump. This is close… But not that close: it pitched just outside leg. 2nd over: England 5-1 (Duckett 3, Pope 2) It’s spin at both ends, with the experienced left-armer Nauman Ali sharing the new ball. Ben Duckett waves his first delivery through midwicket for three, with Azhar Ali somehow saving the boundary despite playing an impromptu game of Twister with the boundary sponge. Pope defends three consecutive deliveries that keep slightly low, then survives a huge LBW appeal after whipping across the line. It was missing leg, but these are good signs for Pakistan. “I really appreciate the loyalty shown to Crawley, but surely he’s had enough chances now,” says Ollie Benson. “Would Bairstow opening in his place not be a worth a look?” I suspect even the Bazball boys would think that a bit too funky, especially in an Ashes year. I don’t think he’s ever opened in first-class cricket and he’d be too vulnerable to the new ball. 1st over: England 0-1 (Duckett 0, Pope 0) “Pakistan have been motoring along at just under 4rpo, which in days of yore (ie earlier this year) would be a rollocking rate,” says Andy Bradshaw. “But suggests that England have got right in their heads, they know they have to score a lot quickly so can’t just plod along at 2rpo because England can knock that off in a session. Which makes taking wickets easier &amp; the chances of England win more likely. This Stokes bloke is good.” Zak Crawley goes for a fifth-ball duck! He pushed defensively on the back foot at a whistling, fizzing legbreak from Abrar Ahmed that hit him plumb in front – so plumb that he doesn’t bother wasting a review. Crawley missed that by a mile. Here come the England openers. We should have time for three overs before the close. “A jobsharer as keeper isn’t a bad idea at all,” says John Starbuck. “You could have Bairstow and Pope alternating each innings (Duckett in reserve), which means more rest for one of them as a batter and reduced number of injuries. They thus become the Keeping Unit with specialised support and training. You should email Baz about this.” It feels a bit gimmicky to me, though I appreciate I’m a bit of an old fart, stuck as I am in April 2022. Leach ends with figures of 31-2-140-4, while the teenage debutant Rehan Ahmed took two for 89. Rehan bowled some loose balls, as you’d expect, but there were plenty of jaffas too, especially googlies. Overall England have done superbly to restrict Pakistan to 304 on such a pudding of a pitch, though it should start to turn more as the match progresses. Jack Leach finishes the innings with a ripper. It curves into Abrar Ahmed then straightens sharply to hit the top of off stump. Abrar stands wide-eyed in his crease for a few seconds, trying to work out how he’s been bowled. He should be smiling, because those last two wickets came from deliveries that turned a fair way. That’ll do! Lovely bowling from Leach, who lures Agha Salman to his demise. Agha came down the track and was beaten first by the flight and then by the turn. Ben Foakes did the rest. 78th over: Pakistan 299-8 (Agha 56, Wasim 7) Agha is fine to continue. 77.4 overs: Pakistan 299-8 (Agha 56, Wasim 7) Even at the end of a long day/tour, Wood is breaking 90mph with most of his deliveries in this spell. Agha is surprised by a short ball that follows him and rams into first the collarbone and then the (unprotected) side of the neck. There’s a break in play while he is treated. 77th over: Pakistan 297-8 (Agha 55, Wasim 6) Agha walks down the track and chips Leach stylishly over the off side for four. A single off the fourth ball gives Wasim two balls to survive; he’s beaten by the first… and then belabours the second back over Leach’s head for six! Now that’s how a No10 should get off the mark. “I feel like this tour might be ending a couple of England careers as well as starting them,” says Phil Harrison. “For example, once Bairstow is fit again, the only way you keep Brook in the team is if Foakes drops out and JB takes the gloves again. Similarly with Leach: if Ahmed continues to look the more dangerous spinner (and given that he can bat a bit too), I can well imagine Stokes deciding to go with him plus a bit of Root from now on. It’s a tough old game at the top.” It’d be a helluva call to play an 18-year-old leggie against Australia; I’m not sure we’re at that stage yet, although you never know with Baz n Ben. I’ve been thinking about Foakes and I can’t make my mind up. Ideally I’d want Bairstow to stay at No5 and concentrate exclusively on his batting, especially after his astonishing form in the summer. For now I think I would put Brook back on the cab rank, but it’s a very tricky decision. One argument in favour of playing them all is that Stokes could drop down to No7, which is more suited to the statement cameos in which he has specialised since becoming captain. I suppose the moral of the Bazball story is: all bets are off, orthodoxy be damned. It wouldn’t completely shock me if they ended up having a wicketkeeping jobshare between Bairstow and Pope. 76th over: Pakistan 286-8 (Agha 50, Wasim 0) With the tail finally exposed, Mark Wood returns to the attack. But it’s Agha Salman who’s on strike, and he protects Wasim by defending the first four deliveries. A single off the fifth takes Agha to another impressive half-century from 83 balls. He struggled at times against Rehan Ahmed but has looked really good against everyone else. Wasim plays his part by defending a nipbacker from Wood. 75th over: Pakistan 285-8 (Agha 49, Wasim 0) That was a useful knock from Nauman, a punchy 24-ball 20, but he’ll feel like he’s left a few more runs out there. Another soft dismissal. Nauman sliced a slog-sweep back over the bowler Leach’s head, and Stokes ran round from mid-off to take a comfortable catch. 74th over: Pakistan 278-7 (Agha 44, Nauman 20) Joe Root replaces Jack Leach (28-2-119-1). He goldenarmed Mohammad Rizwan in the afternoon session, and England would love another freebie before the second new ball. They almost get a second run out after a mix-up between Agha and Nauman, who was ballwatching. Leach’s off-balance throw from mid-off was slightly wide, which meant Foakes had to fetch the ball before breaking his stumps. That gave Nauman just enough time to get home. 73rd over: Pakistan 278-7 (Agha 43, Nauman 19) Dead rubber, dead pitch, old ball: it’s fair to say the game is meandering a touch. Another shortish delivery from Rehan Ahmed – he is getting tired – is heaved through midwicket for four by Agha. 72nd over: Pakistan 272-7 (Agha 37, Nauman 19) Darkness doesn’t descend as quickly in Karachi, so we should get another hour’s play. Agha Salman looks in the mood to go all night; he walks down the track to drive Leach handsomely over extra cover for four. Beautiful batting. After a few singles, Nauman makes it a double-figure over with an emphatic reverse sweep for four. 71st over: Pakistan 261-7 (Agha 31, Nauman 14) Nauman drags a short ball from Rehan through midwicket for four. I wonder if Rehan is getting a bit tired, mentally rather than physically. Saying which, Nauman tries to drive the next ball and edges it wide of slip. It looks like the spinners will bowl until the second new ball is available. England’s seamers really are struggling here. It reminds me a bit of a similar dead rubber in New Zealand in 1991-92, when most of the quicks had niggles and Phil Tufnell and Graeme Hick bowled forever. David Lawrence was still giving everything as the game meandered to a draw on the final evening, with tragic consequences. 70th over: Pakistan 257-7 (Agha 31, Nauman 10) Agha sweeps Leach firmly round the corner for four more. He resourceful and dogged and looks a good player, certainly for a No7. Nauman hacks a single to deep square to move into double figures. “On the Ashraf review, I thought there seemed to be a very tiny period of deviation from flat shown on the UltraEdge,” says Colin Garwood. “Were my eyes deceiving me or do the rules require a clearer spike?” I don’t think it’s set in stone but, yes, generally it needs to be a bigger spike rather than a murmur. 69th over: Pakistan 250-7 (Agha 26, Nauman 8) A short ball from Rehan is savaged for four by Agha, an excellent shot. He looks more comfortable when he’s attacking the leggie, in fact. Rehan Ahmed’s figures are 20-2-79-2, and since lunch 15-2-42-2. Verily, he’d have taken it. 68th over: Pakistan 246-7 (Agha 22, Nauman 8) “Your opponent was Geoffrey Chaucer?” says John Starbuck. “Who won?” I’m bisorwen ich assumede sin waſ ain rhetorical questfōre-dēde. 67.3 overs: Pakistan 245-7 (Agha 21, Nauman 8) Nauman pulls the ball straight into the helmet of Pope at short leg. There’s a break in play while he has a concussion test, so the umpires have called for drinks. Nauman is not out! Nauman pushed at a delivery that turned down the leg side, with Foakes clasping the ball at the second attempt. There was a scratch as it went past the bat – but there’s nothing on UltraEdge so England lose another review. They have one left. ANOTHER ENGLAND REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND AND I’M NOT REALLY SURE WHY I’VE GOT CAPS LOCK ON IT’S ONLY A NO9 BATTER IN A DEAD RUBBER AFTER ALL I MEAN MAYBE IF IT WAS REHAN AHMED BUT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE This time more than any other time it’s Leach to Nauman, and I haven’t a clue what happened. You’re welcome! 67th over: Pakistan 244-7 (Agha 21, Nauman 7) Another thing to like about Rehan Ahmed is his calm demeanour. He has celebrated his wickets, of course he has, but it’s been relatively low-key. If I had taken a Test wicket at 18, I’d have called for a microphone to give an Oscar-winning speech. The new batter Nauman Ali sweeps consecutively deliveries for four and then three. He’s a decent Test No9, with an average of 24 and a top-score of 97, albeit against Zimbabwe. This is turning into a memorable first day for Rehan Ahmed. He’s picked up his second wicket, with Faheem Ashraf beaten all ends up by a googly from round the wicket. The umpire took a while to give it, and Faheem reviewed, but replays showed it was hitting off and middle halfway up. Well done, kiddo. 66th over: Pakistan 236-6 (Agha 20, Faheem 4) Faheem finally gets off the mark from his 21st delivery, pinging a reverse sweep for four off Leach. “That footage of Warnie with little Rehan is quite a thing,” says Phil Harrison. “It’s made me feel quite emotional. Must admit, it’s frying my brain a bit that England now has a Test cricketer who was born when I was already in my thirties. And he’s really good too.” It’s crazy isn’t it. When I was Rehan’s age my toughest opponent was Chaucer, not Babar Azam. 65th over: Pakistan 231-6 (Agha 19, Faheem 0) Rehan is really into his work now. Since lunch his figures are 13-2-30-1. “Because it is clearly far too early to tell, this is the perfect time for wild speculation and needless pressure building,” says David Horn. “If we were, rather cruelly, to create a scale of international leg spinners starting at one end with Mason Crane and ending at the other with Shane Warne, I wonder how far young Rehan will go? If he ends up somewhere around two-thirds of a Stuart MacGill, that would be truly remarkable.” Och yeah, you’d take that. MacGill was such a good bowler, even if he was the victim of possibly the most contemptuous shot in cricket history. Boxing Day Test 2003, second ball: off you pop. ASHRAF IS NOT OUT! There’s nothing on UltraEdge, so Faheem Ashraf survives. It was such a good googly, which straightened past Ashraf’s defensive push. Foakes thought there was an edge, so did Root, but the technology suggested otherwise. ENGLAND REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND! It was a gorgeous googly from Rehan to Ashraf, and Ben Foakes is sure it’s out. 64th over: Pakistan 230-6 (Agha 18, Faheem 0) Agha, who looks more comfortable against the orthodox spinner, sweeps Leach firmly through square leg for four and then steals a single to mid-on. Stokes’s throw shattered the stumps – and the stumpcam in fact - but Agha was comfortably home. There’s a break in play while the camera is repaired. 63rd over: Pakistan 225-6 (Agha 13, Faheem 0) Agha is not enjoying himself against Rehan. He almost offers a return catch and then survives a big LBW shbout after pushing around a googly. It turned a long way and would have missed leg stump. 62nd over: Pakistan 224-6 (Agha 12, Faheem 0) Faheem survives an appeal for a catch down the leg side off Leach. There was a big deviation but I’m pretty sure it was off the thigh pad. Replays show that’s exactly what happened. 61st over: Pakistan 221-6 (Agha 8, Faheem 0) Rehan bowls a nice maiden to Faheem Ashraf. He has been able to settle into a nice spell here. His first five overs before lunch went for 37; since then he has figures of 11-2-28-1, with the emphasis on the second 1. “Nice bowling Ray!” says Ben Foakes, which sends my mind off into the world of Mr Inbetween. Has there been a better TV series since the Sopranos? Nah mate. 60th over: Pakistan 221-6 (Agha 8, Faheem 0) With Babar gone, Jack Leach returns in place of Mark Wood. Stokes must be really struggling with his knee. Agha comes down the track to crunch a couple into the leg side, the only runs from the over. Pakistan bat pretty deep in this game, so England aren’t into the tail yet. 59th over: Pakistan 219-6 (Agha 7) Babar batted beautifully, making 78 from 123 balls, and looked nailed-on for a century. That’s another bonus wicket for England, the biggest of the lot. Well well well. Babar Azam has been needlessly run out! Agha turned Rehan into the leg side and set off for a single, with Babar reluctantly accepting the call. Brook threw flat and hard to Foakes, who collected the ball in front of the stumps and then broke the wicket as he fell forward. Foakes disturbed the first bail while collecting the throw – but that didn’t matter because the second one stayed on, and Foakes removed it with Babar just short of his ground. Had Foakes knocked both bails off before he had the ball, Babar would have survived. 58th over: Pakistan 217-5 (Babar 77, Agha 6) Mark Wood, god bless him, is going to bowl one more over. England’s seamers really are on their last legs here. Anderson is a quadragenarian, Wood is shattered, Stokes is injured and Robinson has a bad tummy. Wood starts with a wide, which means he’ll have to bowl an extra ball. He walks back to his mark with the expression of a man who lovingly made four perfect souffles and then dropped them while dishing up. “I’ll tell you how slow this pitch is,” says Nasser Hussain on Sky. “Ben Foakes could stand up to Mark Wood here.” Wood is giving everything, desperately trying to get blood out of the stone, but there’s nothing there. 57th over: Pakistan 216-5 (Babar 77, Agha 6) Ben Stokes, who hasn’t bowled since his 74-over spell in the first Test, is warming up and looks set to replace Wood at the Knacker’s Yard End. Rehan finds Agha’s outside edge with a nice legbreak, but the ball drops well short of slip. Agha gets in a pickle with the googly later in the over, bat-padding it in the air on the leg side. There was no short leg this time. The kid is doing pretty well here – not as good as Ian Salisbury on debut, better than Chris Schofield. 56th over: Pakistan 216-5 (Babar 77, Agha 6) There’s a suggestion of reverse for Wood, but Babar is as solid as ever in defence. Wood has such a good record outside England: 15 Tests, 54 wickets at 24.53. Barring statistical freaks, that’s the lowest average for an England bowler overseas since John Lever swung his last in 1981. At home Wood averages in the forties, though that’s partly down to a dreadful series against South Africa in 2017 when he was bowling at half ratpower. 55th over: Pakistan 214-5 (Babar 77, Agha 5) Agha, who struggled against Rehan before tea, waves a shortish delivery through point for three. 54th over: Pakistan 210-5 (Babar 76, Agha 2) Mark Wood starts to Babar Azam after tea. He signals his plan by setting a 3/6 field, and confirms it by ramming the first ball into the middle of the pitch. It doesn’t get up and Babar sways out of the way. Babar takes the pull on later in the over, swatting Wood in front of square for four. This pitch is so slow. This is just lovely: Shane Warne watching a 13-year-old Rehan Ahmed Feel Good Inc Teatime reading The eagerly awaited Australia v South Africa series started with a bang at the Gabba, where 15 wickets fell on the first day. 53rd over: Pakistan 204-5 (Babar 71, Agha 1) Time for one last over from Rehan Ahmed before tea. Salman Agha top-edges a sweep into his arm; then he’s beaten by a very good legspinner. As Waqar Younis says on commentary, it’s the threat of the googly that leads to tentative strokes like that. Rehan beats Agha again with the penultimate ball of the session. That’s a terrific over, and he walks off proudly alongside Mark Wood. His figures of 12-0-59-1 don’t entirely do justice to an encouraging debut. England have had a decent day, finding some weird and wonderful ways to take wickets on a very slow pitch. But Babar Azam is still there, 71 not out and entirely imperturbable. See you in 10-15 minutes for the evening session. 52nd over: Pakistan 203-5 (Babar 70, Agha 1) Wood’s pace is down a bit, generally in the high-80s rather than the mid-90s, though that is entirely understandable in the circumstances. He’s such an admirable, selfless bloke; if he’s not giving it, he hasn’t got it. He still has enough to produce a sizzling 91mph yorker that is really well defended by Agha Salman. Wood oohs and aahs and then goes back to his mark for more. He really is the Tigger of English cricket. 51st over: Pakistan 202-5 (Babar 69, Agha 1) Rehan Ahmed changes end to replace Root, who is hooked despite taking Rizwan’s wicket. (Not that he had much to do with it.) Babar has played Rehan pretty respectfully, only really going after the bad balls. Two singles from the over. “Just realised that an England bowlers younger than my daughter has just taken a Test match wicket,” writes Steven Pye. “Time for me to investigate retirement homes, I think.” And if you want something to read during the upcoming tea break, here’s Steven on England’s famous win in Karachi 22 years ago. 50th over: Pakistan 200-5 (Babar 68, Agha 0) Mark Wood replaces Rehan Ahmed, who has ODI figures on his Test debut: 10-0-56-1. I’m about as qualified to talk about legspin as I am to talk about hair care, so I’ll defer to the Sky commentators. In short: Rehan turns his googly more than his leggie, his length has been a bit hit and miss (understandably), his front arm drops a bit early, and he has all the time in the world to figure it out. There’s a soupçon of reverse for Wood, though nothing that would trouble Babar. After five dot balls, Babar flicks a boundary behind square. Beautifully timed. Man his bat is one big never-ending middle. 49th over: Pakistan 196-5 (Babar 64, Agha 0) Root was laughing his head off when Stokes took that catch, knowing it was a filthy delivery that deserved anything but a wicket. A huge bonus for England just before tea! Rizwan charged Root and clunked a dipping full toss high into the leg side. Stokes ran round from deepish mid-on to take a well-judged catch. That’s an Andrex-soft dismissal, and Rizwan stomps off in disgust. 48th over: Pakistan 194-4 (Babar 63, Rizwan 18) Rizwan is sweeping everything. He drags Rehan off middle stump – he’d have been in all sorts of bother had he missed – for one of four singles in the over. 47th over: Pakistan 190-4 (Babar 61, Rizwan 16) Joe Root replaces Jack Leach and starts around the wicket to the right-handers. Three singles from the over. Meanwhile, Ben Duckett has left the field after hurting his ankle in the previous over. 46th over: Pakistan 187-4 (Babar 59, Rizwan 15) Rizwan reaches a long way to sweep Rehan for two, with Duckett doing well to save the boundary. His left ankle got stuck in the pitch as he did so, and he’s limping slightly. Rehan has figures of 9-0-52-1. We need a Bazball converter to see what they are worth in a normal Test team. “I wonder if you will get to sit your grandchildren down in the run up to future Christmases,” begins Brian Withington, “and regale them with anniversary tales of the time you took over the Guardian OBO from the blessed Tanya Aldred just as the legendary bowler Rehan Ahmed took his first ever Test wicket? Here’s hoping…” For reasons you really don’t want or need to know, it’ll be a rare old Christmas miracle if that happens. 45th over: Pakistan 182-4 (Babar 57, Rizwan 12) Rizwan, the cricketing personification of perkiness, sweeps Leach for four and then whips another through midwicket. He’s raced to 12 from 12 balls. 44th over: Pakistan 174-4 (Babar 57, Rizwan 4) A bit of a comedown over for Rehan, with Babar pulling a short ball for four. It’s all part of his education, same as it was for Shane Warne to be panelled round the SCG by Ravi Shastri on his debut. “In the 41st over you pointed out that Leech’s average was better under Root than Stokes,” says Tom Holdsworth. “Might that demonstrate the point of Bazball: strike rate matters more than average?” It might… if the strike rate wasn’t also worse under Stokes (80, as compared to 67 under Root). But I should stress that there are reasons for the discrepancy. Leach played on a number on Bunsens under Root. 43rd over: Pakistan 168-4 (Babar 51, Rizwan 4) The nicest thing about Rehan’s wicket is that was deserved. Shakeel didn’t slap a full toss to midwicket; he was unsettled by the googly and then pushed nervously at the next ball. And crucially, as David Gower and Nasser Hussain are pointing out on Sky, the length was spot on. Meanwhile, Jack Leach (remember him?) bowls an excellent over… until Rizwan sweeps firmly for four to get off the mark. Wasn’t much wrong with the delivery. 42nd over: Pakistan 162-4 (Babar 50, Rizwan 0) Earlier in the over, Babar waved a full toss from Rehan for a single to reach another serene half-century: 74 balls, 6x4, 0xhope for England. By the way I said Pope’s catch was very good. I was wrong: it was outstanding. “Good morning Rob, from a balmy Las Palmas,” says Kim Thonger. “It will be 22C this afternoon here. Lovely day for cricket, and I discover that various communities on the larger Canary Islands have set up cricket clubs to play Twenty20, with marvellous names such as Scorpio Warriors and Pagoda Kings. Jimmy Anderson could thrive here in semi-retirement. Nice and warm, occasional cloud cover at both ends of the day, and a lovely bit of humidity for late swing. Read all about it here.” Never mind Jimmy, I’ll be practising a bit of wobble seam in the corridor during the team break. Rehan Ahmed has his first Test wicket! He beat Shakeel with the previous delivery, a gorgeous googly, and as a result Shakeel then pushed tentatively at a fullish legspinner. He got a big inside-edge onto the pad, with the ball looping up in the air. Pope swooped forward from short leg to take a very good one-handed catch. It went upstairs but there’s no controversy with this one. What a delightful, charming moment. Rehan Ahmed became England’s youngest men’s Test cricketer a few hours ago; now he’s their youngest wickettaker. 41st over: Pakistan 161-3 (Babar 49, Shakeel 23) It’s notable that, despite their popular bromance, Jack Leach’s record under the captaincy of Ben Stokes (avge 44) is much worse than under Joe Root (avge 32). There are a few reasons for that, not least the fact he hasn’t played on any vile turners under Stokes, but it’s interesting nonetheless. Isn’t it? Oh. 40th over: Pakistan 160-3 (Babar 48, Shakeel 23) Rehan Ahmed was a bit short in his first spell, which went for 37 from five overs. He’s noticeably fuller this time, too much so when Shakeel drives through extra cover for two. That aside it’s a pretty good over. I still can’t quite believe we are watching an 18-year-old English legspinner playing Test cricket. Thanks Tanya, morning everyone. I timed that well: Rehan Ahmed is coming on for his second spell. They pause for drinks, and I’ll hand you over to the master, Rob Smyth, to take you through to stumps. Just in case the Test doesn’t go to day five, wishing you all a very merry Christmas, with an especially happy one to my mum and dad who are waking up this morning in a new house for the first time in 40 years. Thanks for all the messages – bye! 39th over: Pakistan 157-3 (Babar 47, Shakeel 21) Leach bowls one ball then presents it to Stokes. To say, who knows? But he’s sent back on his way without consulting the umpire. A fistful of singles. 38th over: Pakistan 153-3 (Babar 45, Shakeel 19) Wood continues to charge in, well into the nineties mph. Sweat gleans on his forehead and he wipes it over the ball. Shakeel pulls and Rehan fields. We move on. 37th over: Pakistan 151-3 (Babar 44, Shakeel 18) Leach will have a sore shoulder by this evening. Over number 17 under his belt, not even half way through the second session of day one. Babar casually ticks off a run. “James Walsh….asks if anyone else has ever splashed out on seeing an all-conquering team on an off day,” writes John Cox. ”Not quite but my mother, then a teenager living near Lords and with a crush on Denis Compton, took advantage of some early children-free-after-lunch deal to watch the great man seven times during his famous 1948 season, and used to boast that she never saw him score a run. Five times the opponents were batting, once DC came in in the last over and spent the night on 0 not out, and finally she got to see him face a ball, only to witness his only duck of the season.” 36th over: Pakistan 150-3 (Babar 43, Shakeel 18) The cameras focus on Keaton Jennings, who hasn’t played a Test on this tour. Athers tells us that he has just earned his MBA from the University of Manchester. Very impressive, and such a nice guy as well. A maiden from Mark Wood. 35th over: Pakistan 150-3 (Babar 43, Shakeel 18) Shakeel stretches with the front leg, as if trying to take in one more stair in haste, and sweeps Leach to the rope. 34th over: Pakistan 144-3 (Babar 42, Shakeel 13) Mark Wood for his second spell, this time from the pavilion end. Starts with some full balls, finishes with a bouncer that bounces so low that Shakeel is practically squatting as he ducks it. Ben Elkington writes, from under a duvet in Leicester: “I have an innocent and probably sleep-befuddled question: given the lack of Test cricket in Pakistan for so long, the grounds have all seemed relatively empty. Is this down to pricing, the home team performance or ambivalence to test match/red ball cricket? (Apologies if this has been covered previously, wasn’t sure.) And, like the ITV World Cup coverage, I’m concerned that I’m lying here thinking, “yeah, KFC for breakfast is alright in December, isn’t it?” Hi Ben. I think the grounds filled up well during the day in Rawalpindi and Multan – not sure about Karachi. Our man on the ground, Ali Martin, strokes his beard, “Not sure the reason here, maybe series lost … good few sensibly hiding in the shade at the back of the stands.” 33rd over: Pakistan 141-3 (Babar 40, Shakeel 12) A maiden from Leach which includes a beautifully choreographed whipping off of the bails by Ben Foakes as Shakeel goes for the sweep. Feet were firmly anchored in the crease, but sweetly done. ”Ashamed to admit that I shabbily missed the start of play;” admits Brian Withington, “and the awarding of debut cap to Rehan Ahmed by Nasser - quite the moment I gather, and so lovely to see his Dad involved. Nice words from Azhar Ali too. What’s that, you say? Must be some dust in the eye …” 32nd over: Pakistan 141-3 (Babar 40, Shakeel 12) Babar plonks his front leg forward and with a frosty-crisp punch dispatches Robinson past a sprawling mid-on. The next ball nibbles in and with a waft of the glove, Babar lets Shakeel know that reverse swing is happening. 31st over: Pakistan 136-3 (Babar 36, Shakeel 12) Leach prowls in, Shakeel largely unbothered. Stokes has a long chat with him as he makes the long walk back to his fielding position on the boundary. So true. 30th over: Pakistan 135-3 (Babar 35, Shakeel 11) Stokes fiddles and finesses his field. “Hello again Tanya.” Robert Lewis, hi! “Not Bazball, but I was at the SCG in 1976 in the series mentioned recently on OBO where the Windies were rocked by pace and decided to go with a 4-man attack. I remember a highly miffed Michael Holding, then around 20 years old, walking so very slowly back to his mark when a decision went against him.” 29th over: Pakistan 134-3 (Babar 35, Shakeel 10) Ooof Babar charges Leach, over the top, not quite all there but it falls safely out of reach of a slowly reversing lorry Robinson. The link to the PCB youtube page (thank you!): 28th over: Pakistan 130-3 (Babar 32, Shakeel 9) In Manchester it is sleeting in the dark, in Karachi, the sun shines. Shakeel content to play Robinson back until swivel-pulling his penultimate ball for four. And another, a full toss disappears, off-driven with panache. “Tucked under my duvet with a hot water bottle and a coffee, but still freezing, of course,” writes Archie Sparrow. “I found that session really enjoyable. Dead pitch, yes, but we’re still able to make things happen. I remember waking up for the first session of the first test and rubbing my hands in a Mr Burns-esque fashion. It’s only gotten better since then. Is it finally time, as England fans, that we can admit we’re actually really quite good at this test cricket thing?” Wash your mouth out Archie! 27th over: Pakistan 122-3 (Babar 32, Shakeel 1) Root awaits at first slip, Pope (?) at leg slip, as Leach changes ends after lunch. A shout of “Pakistan Zindabad” livens up the still pretty empty ground. There are beautiful canopies over the stands – something English grounds are going to have to think about with the climate crisis. The lack of shelter at The Riverside caused all sorts of issues during the ODI on the UK’s hottest day last year. John Starbuck, hello! “I didn’t make the start but picked up the progress via the mighty OBO. No kids to fuss over, but I have had to stroke the cat, then go out in the frost to the garage and switch off my charging car. Meanwhile, my wife has finished the gingerbread men (with holes for hanging on Xmas trees) and is onto baking the mince pies, for her family do, though shortened by Covid, alas. Still, we all have responsibilities.” 26th over: Pakistan 120-3 (Babar 31, Shakeel 1) Robinson polishes off his over, fragmented by the wicket off Azhar on the stroke of lunch. “Last time i sent an email,” writes Daniel Ironside, “it was swiftly followed by a leaking water pipe catastrophe. This has now been blamed on the elves. England subsequently won that marvellous test match so just hoping that for superstitions sake the whole thing doesn’t need to be repeated.” What are pipes on the altar of Bazball? Two cups of coffee in, all is well. Dog has a full tummy, paper boy is on his round, Ian Ward is in full lounge lizard, leg resting on knee, on the Sky sofa. James Walsh is back, and this time I’ve spelt his name right (apologies), “I’ve only seen one Test of the nascent Bazball era in person - and it’s the only one they’ve lost so far, Lord’s v. South Africa in the summer. “There was a surreal lack of jeopardy, though most of the stand where I was sat was more interested in the champagne corks hitting the outfield than the cricket. “Has anyone else out there ever splashed out on an otherwise all-conquering team on one of their rare off days?” Jimmy Anderson is talking to Nasser. “ A decent session, we bowled brilliantly, the short ball tactic worked well. This surface is two paced so it is difficult for the batter to know whether to take it on or not. Woody has been bowling cross seam as well which should set it up for reverse-swing later on.” I have news Sam Fox! Not TMS, but the guerilla cricket link. 25.2 overs: Pakistan 117-3 (Babar 30) A timely wicket for England, in the last over before lunch. Robinson does the business again and Azhar falls just short of fifty in his penultimate Test innings. It’s been intriguing watching young Rehan Ahmed as he goes through his tricks. A pause, a sandwich, a sit down, and he can start again. Time for me to put the kettle on and flat-line coffee. Back shortly! Off Azhar’s glove and a super catch by Foakes, diving to his left and almost sucked into the gloves an inch off the ground. Soft signal is not out, but Foakes is very keen. So is Robinson. 25th over: Pakistan 117-2 (Azhar 45, Babar 30) Stokes has a long chat with Ahmed at the end of his run, whose ten to two feet are planted firmly in concentration. He drops short with his googly and Azhar tucks in, though in slightly unbalanced way. The next is fuller, straighter, better. Seven from the over, and lunch bubbling on the hearth. 24th over: Pakistan 108-2 (Azhar 40, Babar 26) Robinson is back after being off the field. Causes immediate trouble, as Azhar nearly plays the ball straight to the waiting silly mid=on , a thick edge slices through second slip for four, then hits him on the arm. 23rd over: Pakistan 102-2 (Azhar 35, Babar 26) A full toss from Rehan Ahmed and Babar sweeps as if wafting a fan for four. And another boundary as Babar eyes up the googly and tucks in with knife, fork and spoon. Will Stokes give him another over, or is this enough for a first taste? 22nd over: Pakistan 93-2 (Azhar 34, Babar 18) Azhar, who has the most runs ever at No. 3 in Tests for Pakistan (4055), looking increasingly comfortable. Hello Robert Lewis! “Morning Tanya, from a sunny and mild Istanbul. Yesterday I caught the end of the autumn, finding parasol mushrooms in the forest in the west of the city. Perhaps Stokes is planning on a bowl himself, to bolster the slightly weaker attack?” Actually he said that at the toss, he’s going to have to put in the hard yards. 21st over: Pakistan 89-2 (Azhar 31, Babar 17) Ahmed again, his arm lovely and high, delivered with a snap of the back foot, the leg flicked out in a backwards attitude . Babar drives, edges, and the ball flies through an empty gully. The last falls too full, Azhar drives, another boundary. 20th over: Pakistan 79-2 (Azhar 26, Babar 12) Azhar plays a perpendicular bat and sends Leach towards the rope where it is cut off. A bit of this and that picked off by Azhar. 18th over: Pakistan 74-2 (Azhar 21, Babar 12) Ahmed gets through his over in the time it takes me to pick up my biro from under the sofa. Two from it 18th over: Pakistan 72-2 (Azhar 20, Babar 11) A frankly glorious dance and smack by Babar for four off Leach. 17th over: Pakistan 66-2 (Azhar 19, Babar 6) He looks nerveless, dries his hands again in the dust, and is suddenly ready. The first ball floats up, a leg-break , and he’s off! Pakistan are busy, they don’t want any spell cast. Azhar swivels and shovels him for four. And suddenly it’s done. He fiddles with his collar: nicely done. 16th over: Pakistan 59-2 (Azhar 12, Babar 6) Azhar bursts a four through where Leach’s hands might have been, if he’d reacted quickly enough in his follow through. 15th over: Pakistan 52-2 (Azhar 7, Babar 4) Pakistan play pauper and prince within two balls to Mark Wood – the first a clueless ugly swipe by Azhar, the next a wristy, effortless pull for four by Babar .Wood’s judicious short balls proving a test for Babar – as the pictures point out on Sky, his chest on stance makes it quite awkward to evade the bouncer. 14th over: Pakistan 47-2 (Azhar 6, Babar 0) Did I mention that Leach is bowling in sunglasses? Prescription sunglasses, I guess. He continues to strangle Azha. Rehan Ahmed dries his hands in the dust. Soon? Babar, as Nasser Hussain reminds us, does struggle to pick the googly. “Morning Tanya,” Hello Andy Ravenscroft! “Thanks for doing these in such ungodly hours. Pitch looks slower than my dear departed grandad driving up hill, whilst towing a caravan. Stokes showing again he has a plan though, 2 down somehow! Looking forward to seeing the new leggie.” 13th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Azhar 5, Babar 0) Excellent bust-a-gut bowling by Wood ,and England have got rid of the tricky Masood. It brings in Babar, who, I’m told, loves batting at Karachi. The last time Babar batted here he got 196. The short ball works! What have you done Shan? He pulls, top-edges and Leach at fine leg takes it by his ankles and says thanks very much. 12th over: Pakistan 46-1 (Shan 30, Azhar 5) Azhar breaks the strangle-hold with a lovely back-foot four off Leach. “ Another night with a teething baby means les sleep but also that I can catch the test match before the day begins,” taps William Vignoles. “There’s a weird unique joy of watching a test from some far-flung place in the small hours - even last year’s horror moments of Axar Patel skirling England were weirdly enjoyable. Maybe it’s just innate pessimism but this England attack feels slightly underpowered?” Good work with the baby – those nights are long, but overseas cricket definitely makes them more bearable. As for England, much depends on Robinson’s tummy and Ahmed’s debut… 11th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Shan 30, Azhar 1) Azhar is hit on the arm by a lightning Wood bullet, and the teams take drinks while the physio comes on with the magic spray. News that Robinson is off the pitch with bad guts, which could make this a long morning for England’s seamers. Perhaps an earlier debut than there might be for Rehan Ahmed? Oh that’s a lovely fluent pull by Shan, tucked between two fielders for four. Sam Fox, Finbar has an overseas link for you. Hope it works! 10th over: Pakistan 35-1 (Shan 25, Azhar 1) Oh, England go for an unlikely looking appeal to the last ball of Leach’s over, at least from my sofa….it turns out to be closer than it looked but still umpire’s call as Shan misses a reverse-sweep. An eventful over, with Shan dancing and pinging a boundary over long on and tingly reverswe-sweep for three. Azhar off the mark to his eleventh ball. 9th over: Pakistan 27-1 (Shan 18, Azhar 0) More short stuff from Wood, who tumbles over in his follow-through with the exertion. Shan picks up a single from a tickle round the corner, but Azhar remains scoreless. A good effort “Good morning Tanya,” hello Mark Dexter! “My understanding is that Pakistan is a cricket-mad country. So why are there less people in the ground than would vote for Liz Truss if there were a general election tomorrow?” The grounds tend to start empty and fill-up during the day. We had an email in the last Test from (novelist) Kamilia Shamsie who said that Pakistan were not a nation for early starts. But you’re right, lots of noise on the coverage but not much evidence of many people. 8th over: Pakistan 26-1 (Shan 17, Azhar 0) Masood gently tucks into Leach, with a leaned, extra-cover boundary and three more. The sun is shining brightly on the hard oatmeal pitch. 7th over: Pakistan 19-1 (Shan 10, Azhar 0) Wood is whistled up to the coal face. Runs in with customary vigour, and even squeezes a couple of bouncers off a dead deck. 6th over: Pakistan 18-1 (Shan 9, Azhar 0) Two more close fielders jostle in for Azhar A;i’s penultimate Test innings. He looks eager to get off the mark, a bit frisky, but no immediate joy. A wicket maiden for Leach, who may look to exploit this low bounce. “Sorry to rub it in for anyone stuck in freezing Britain, but I have a day laying in the sun by the red sea ahead of me, which can only be enhanced with the dulcet sounds of try TMS team in my ears. Does anyone have the overseas TMS link to share?” Really sorry to break it to you Sam Fox, but I don’t think there is a TMS link – in previous Tests people have followed it via the PCB website. But I am extremely jealous of your sunshine. If any OBO-ers can help with any other info, please let me know. Umpire’s call it is, so off Shafique must go! Done by one that skids on and plops him on the knee. Shafique makes a last minute call to try to overturn the umpire’s finger… 5th over: Pakistan 18-0 (Shafique 8, Shan 9) Put the Christmas tree lights on, a sparkly companion to the OBO. I actually bought some new ones this year – multi-coloured in homage to my 70s-80s childhood. White suddenly seemed a bit boring. Anyway, back to Karachi, where Robinson hasn’t found much movement on a hot morning, with the kites (I think) circling overhead. Root the only slip. A maiden. 4th over: Pakistan 18-0 (Shafique 8, Shan 9) An immaculate off-drive by Shafique, head over bat, beats Ben Stokes to the boundary. Lovely. 3rd over: Pakistan 17-0 (Shafique 8, Shan 8) An immaculate off-drive by Shafique, head over bat, beats Ben Stokes to the boundary. Lovely. Hello James Walsh“Morning from under the duvet in freezing Tooting. I’m sitting a very clingy Vizler, whose family are off to Belfast for in-law Xmas this early morn. This looks a much more balanced lineup from Pakistan. And England look like they’re missing Jimmy already!” 2nd over: Pakistan 12-0 (Shafique 4, Shan 8) Shan on the attack straight away, with two nimble-toed hits over the top off Jack Leach – taking the new ball at the other end. 1st over: Pakistan 4-0 (Shafique 4, Shan 0) Robinson with the new ball, and a controlled squirt brings Shafique four. Funny for Jimmy to see the future from the bench – a bit like reading your obituary before you’ve died. “morning Tanya!” Hello Finbar Anslow. “Freezing over here. Blooming fire’s gone out, now have to trudge out for kindling .... or I might just get back in bed .... saw Brian Close play at Taunton. Think he might have also been one of the oldest to play for England? Or maybe he’ s up there with longest span between first and last test?” Wilfred Rhodes was the oldest at 52 but Close’s span must be one of the biggest. Time for a quick cup of tea – play starts at 5am. While you’re waiting, here’s a lovely piece on Azhar Ahmed. Or check out the goings-on in Brisbane: Pakistan: Shan Masood, Abdullah Shafique, Azhar Ali, Babar Azam (captain), Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan (wkt), Salman Ali Agha, Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Nauman Ali, Abrar Ahmed. Four changes: in come Azhar Ali in his final Test, slow left armer Nauman Ali, the new Yorkshire captain Shan Masood and 21 year old allrounder Mohammad Wasim Jnr. Mohammad Nawaz, Zahid Mahmood, Mohammad Ali and the injured Imam-ul-Haq are on the bench. England: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Ben Foakes (wkt), Rehan Ahmed, Ollie Robinson, Jack Leach, Mark Wood. Gloves to Foakes, Pope bats, Ahmed on debut. Anderson rested, Jacks on the bench. On a dry pitch, the coin falls the right way for Babar at last. Good morning from Baltic Britain!. But scrap the weather, who is this coming over the hill? It’s Rehan Ahmed, in a Test cap, England’s youngest ever male Test cricketer, at 18 years and 26 days, 23 days younger than Brian Close – and he never gave up anything without a fight. Ahmed, a Leicestershire leg-spinning allrounder, has played just three first-class matches but his talent has been bubbling away – with the Under-19s, with the Lions, with Leicestershire and now with England. With the series already won, Ben Foakes also plays, replacing the resting Jimmy Anderson, and removing the gauntlets from Ollie Pope, who will just bat. Will Jacks steps off the merry-go-round.. Change too for Pakistan. They unearthed a gem at Multan – wrist-spinner Abrah Ahmed. But they must say goodbye. This will be stalwart and former captain Azhar Ali’s final Test. “I retire from international cricket as a fulfilled cricketer who ticked most of the goals he had set for himself,” he said in an emotional press conference. “Not many cricketers go on to lead their countries, and that I was able to captain Pakistan is a matter of great pride for me. “From being a kid who started as a leg-spinner to becoming a mainstay in the Test batting lineup, I had the loveliest moments of my life that I will cherish forever.” Play starts at 5am GMT. Set the clocks."
"Stephen Curry started Wednesday night unsure whether he would play at Indiana because of a sore right knee. He finished it in the locker room with an injured left shoulder. The eight-time All-Star, two-time MVP and NBA career leader in three-pointers is expected to have an MRI on Thursday after leaving during the third quarter of Golden State’s 125-119 loss at Indiana. Curry was injured with about two minutes left in the third quarter as the Warriors tried to rally from a 20-point halftime deficit. His three-point play with 4:16 to go in the third got Golden State within 83-80. But when Pacers forward Jalen Smith dribbled toward the baseline, Curry tried to stop him by sticking his left arm out. Smith continued, and Curry’s arm bent back awkwardly. Curry grabbed his shoulder while standing hunched over on the court then walked to the locker room during the next timeout. “The trainers told me midway through the fourth quarter that he wasn’t going to return,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I trust their judgment. I only spoke to him briefly after the game, so I haven’t had a chance to talk with him yet.” Curry did not take questions after scoring 38 points, making five threes and all 11 of his free throws. He isn’t expected to speak to reporters again until Friday, when the defending NBA champs visit Philadelphia on the third stop of a six-game trip. The Warriors already have lost their first two games on their longest Eastern swing of the season. Now they may be without their best player as they try to climb back above .500. “This is a tough stretch of the season and if Steph’s out, it gets tougher for sure,” Kerr said. “If we’re healthy, I feel like we can beat anybody – I think this team has proven that. We’ve just got to find a way to get there.” Curry was his usual, sensational self while he was in the game. He accounted for half of the Warriors’ 54 first-half points and finished with seven rebounds, seven assists and two steals. All-Star guard Klay Thompson missed his second straight game with a right knee injury and Andrew Wiggins sat out with an abdominal injury. Then in the fourth quarter, forward Draymond Green was ejected after picking up two technical fouls in a span of 14 seconds. Because of Curry, the Warriors still had a chance. “He basically put us on his shoulders for the minutes he was out there,” Kerr said. “He was getting to the line, finding other people and I thought the guys did great job of battling.” But if Curry misses any substantial time, the Warriors won’t be the same. “Steph’s always a guy with a great outlook on life,” Kerr said. “So we’re hoping for the best.”"
"Federer and Williams bow out Roger Federer and Serena Williams were born one month apart and having built legendary careers that redefined the concept of longevity in the sport, this year they departed within three weeks of each other. Both retirements were perfect in their own distinct ways. After exhibiting her greatness one last time by spectacularly defeating the world No 2, Anett Kontaveit, at the US Open, a tearful Williams ended her career with a tribute to her greatest rival, her sister, Venus. While Federer was physically compromised by his chronic knee problems, he played his final match surrounded by friends in Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray at the Laver Cup. It was the sight of Nadal sobbing alongside him after the last ball was struck that underlined exactly what his glittering career means to the sport. This year will be remembered for retirements. Ash Barty started the dominoes falling early in the season by winning the Australian Open, her home grand slam title, as the world No 1 before heading off into the sunset, but other retirees included Juan Martín del Potro, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gilles Simon and the 2016 Olympic singles champion, Monica Puig. Djokovic’s deportation from Australia In the first days of the new year, Novak Djokovic decided to post a picture of himself boarding a plane as he announced that he had secured an “exemption permission” to fly to Australia and compete in the Australian Open. After weeks of speculation about his status for Australia due to him refusing Covid vaccinations, he clearly hoped it would mark the end of the subject. Instead it was only the beginning. As he took the long flight to Melbourne, discussions raged over whether he would be allowed into the country. When he was stopped at the border and sequestered in immigration detention alongside refugees subjected to Australia’s immigration policies, he became arguably the biggest story in world news. After days of arduous court proceedings and a brief victory in his first appeal, the No 1 player in the world was deported the night before the tournament began. The Wimbledon ban debacle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was always bound to present more challenging decisions for tennis, where individuals employ their own teams and earn their own money, than many other major sports. The war led to one of the most significant disputes in the open era of the game. Wimbledon’s decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from its events, backed by the UK government, was a stark outlier compared with the wider reaction from the sport. Russia and Belarus were banned from team competitions but individual players from those nations were allowed to compete as neutral athletes. Both men’s and women’s tours deemed Wimbledon’s decision a clear breach of contract, immediately punishing the tour by removing ranking points from the event. They have followed with comprehensive fines for both the All England Club and the LTA. Swiatek’s incredible winning streak After the retirement of Barty, it seemed reasonable to assume that rankings anarchy would follow as the rest of the top women’s players grew accustomed to life without the dominant force. Instead, Iga Swiatek sensed her opportunity and produced one of the most incredible breakthroughs in recent history as she rose to No 1. Swiatek won 37 matches in a row throughout winter and spring, closing off by winning her second French Open. Then she recovered to win the US Open, despite saying beforehand that she hated the lighter balls used in the women’s tournament at Flushing Meadows: “Honestly, any tournament I play with these balls, I didn’t feel well.” Most important, the 21-year-old marked herself as the new dominant player in women’s tennis. Still, it will always be a great shame that Swiatek and Barty so narrowly missed each other’s peak. Alcaraz’s electric Big Apple breakthrough Carlos Alcaraz has been making history ever since his early teens and his breakthrough this year, in which he won his first Masters 1000 titles in Miami and Madrid, beating Nadal and Djokovic back to back in the latter – the first player to do so on clay – was spectacular enough. He followed up his earlier breakthrough by pulling off an unforgettable maiden grand slam run, winning the US Open after a series of thrilling five-set matches, reaching No 1 for the first time and making it clear that he is the future of the sport. He became the first male player to take over the top spot after the US Open since his coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, did it by reaching the 2003 final. “It’s something that I dreamed of since I was a kid – to be No 1 in the world, to be the champion of a grand slam. It’s something that I worked really, really hard [for],” Alcaraz said."
"World Rugby has announced several new measures aimed at speeding up the flow of the game, including a strict time limit for kicking penalties and conversions. The law tweaks come into effect from 1 January and are intended to reduce time wasting by players, time spent consulting the TMO, and also state that water carriers are permitted to enter the field only after a try. The most notable change may prove to be a new countdown clock for kickers. Kickers must take a conversion within 90 seconds of a try being scored, while a penalty must be kicked within 60. Competitions such as the Six Nations will be encouraged to introduce a “shot clock” to help enforce the law, and the time limit will apply “even if the ball rolls over and has to be placed again”. A World Rugby statement said: “The guidelines, which are designed to assist match officials, players and coaches and to enhance fan experience are part of a drive by the international federation to speed up the game and reflect key outcomes of the Shape of the Game conference in November.” World Rugby has also sought to clarify what constitutes a deliberate knock-on, stating: “It is not an intentional knock-on if, in the act of trying to catch the ball, the player knocks on provided that there was a reasonable expectation that the player could gain possession.” The law changes also include a focus on players supporting their own body weight at rucks and mauls. The changes are another item for the in-tray of England’s new head coach, Steve Borthwick, who said he plans to consider “every single player” in attempting to build a team capable of winning the Six Nations and the World Cup. His commitment to taking a fresh look at selection will raise the hopes of a number of players ignored or discarded during Eddie Jones’s tenure. Borthwick was appointed on Monday, with time running short to prepare for England’s Six Nations opener against Scotland on 4 February. “What I am going to do is look at every single player and look at how we make this squad the best England squad we can possibly make right now,” Borthwick said. “I promise you, I am going to be looking at every single player.” The Bath back-rower Ted Hill will be among those hoping to force their way into contention while the Leicester prop, Dan Cole, is another candidate in light of the new coach’s aim of strengthening England’s set-piece. The 43-year-old Borthwick also praised the Premiership as a proving ground for Test talent. “I think it is a really high standard,” he said. “My job is to get selection right, and to give the players a real clear plan.” Borthwick also stressed his belief in establishing combinations. “You [need to] understand where the players are at, understanding the combinations and the cohesion,” Borthwick said. “Effectively, building the team … understanding the importance and seeing the importance of cohesion and partnerships, that’s important.”"
"The glut of fancy dress costumes. The walk-on music singalongs. The nerve-jangling sporting drama. These days, the only way the PDC World Darts Championship would signal the true start of Christmas any more clearly is if Cliff Richard were on stage throwing tinsel-wrapped tungsten in a Santa costume. They flocked in their thousands up Muswell Hill to the venue that is fast becoming sport’s go-to destination during the festive season. Some came as Santa to mark the occasion. Others came as superheroes. Even the world champion, Peter Wright, who was due to play last on Thursday evening, joined in the fun, sporting a Grinch costume for his match against Northern Irish veteran Mickey Mansell. And that is the beauty of this tournament, which is now in its 30th iteration. Anything can happen and unlike in most other sports, where the crowds only flock in their droves to see the world’s best and hold off in the early rounds, here even the prospect of the world No 88 Mansell taking on New Zealand’s Ben Robb – not even ranked in the PDC system – had the Alexandra Palace crowd lapping it up in their thousands. Back when the tournament started in 1994 amidst a wave of uncertainty of darts’ very existence, things could not have been more different. Purfleet’s Circus Tavern hosted modest crowds throughout, Skol Lager were the sponsors and the tournament prize pool was a modest £64,000. This year, the prize money is £2.5 million, with the winner taking £500,000 of that. Darts is big business these days, with the best players multi-millionaires. Michael van Gerwen wasn’t even playing on the opening night, but there were green shirts almost everywhere you looked. Just a stroll along the Ally Pally concourses reaffirmed how darts has gone from a game loved by a select few in the 1990s to a sporting money-making machine in the present day. There are merchandise stands as far as the eye can see, food stalls and, of course, the bars. So many bars. Even the hospitality tickets were a hefty £250 for the opening night. Mansell’s 3-1 victory in the opening match of the night was a nervy one, aided by the crowd jeering him as he stepped forward to try to hit the winning double. That is perhaps the one side of this tournament’s growth that the purists are not so keen on, though the fact is that those in attendance are the ones that drive the prize money and interest up through ticket sales. But the fact that darts has become a global brand away from the oche was just as evident on it during an entertaining night. There were seven players in action from six different nations – including Robb, the New Zealand qualifier, and South Africa’s Grant Sampson, who produced a sensational shock on his world championship debut. Sampson, a little-known 40-year-old from the town of Brackenfell, had to win a qualifier against Africa’s other top players just to reach the Alexandra Palace and had never played in front of a crowd of more than 50. Nobody would have given him a chance against the world No 40, Keane Barry, but Sampson stunned the youngster to cause the first shock of the tournament. It won’t be the last. But after 22-year-old Nathan Rafferty, the young starlet who is another reminder that darts is no longer an old man’s game, edged Jermaine Wattimena, it was time for the main event. For all the drama in the opening three games, those lucky enough to have a ticket for the opening night came to see one man: and Wright didn’t disappoint. Wright’s walk-on to the Pitbull song Don’t Stop The Party is well-known for being extravagant. Fittingly as the reigning champion, he took it to new heights here, emerging in a full Grinch costume complete with gloves and a festive green Mohican. If that sentence doesn’t sum up the madness of this unique sporting spectacle, what on Earth does? Everything extraordinary about Wright’s appearance and entrance was complemented by a straightforward opening to the defence of his title, though. He had far too much for Mansell and while the tougher challenges are undoubtedly to come, you wondered if all the pre-game shenanigans would throw Wright off his game. We should know by now, from a two-time world champion, that wouldn’t be the case, with Wright winning 3-0. For the fans who attend, Ally Pally is an escape from reality for just a few hours, and a sporting party like no other. For the players like Sampson, who held back tears post-match and guaranteed himself a minimum £15,000 payday with victory here, the darts is a dream factory. Lives can change in the blink of an eye forever. It is sport, but not quite as you know it. Inside these four walls in north London, sometimes anything feels possible. The big names are still to enter the fray over the coming days, and there is a long way to go before the winner of the 30th PDC World Championship is crowned. But these days, Christmas just wouldn’t feel like Christmas without the darts. That was evident from the second the opening dart was thrown on Thursday."
"One of the most vexing questions of this NFL season has been: “What is the problem with the Buffalo Bills?” Maybe there isn’t one. The Bills, who started sluggishly and couldn’t quite put it all together for much of the early season, have rounded into form of late. And on Sunday, they put together perhaps the most impressive win any team has produced all season: a 31-10 demolition of the Dallas Cowboys, who entered with a 10-3 record and had been humbling the competition week after week with their high-flying quarterback-and-receiver duo of Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb. But when the Cowboys got to western New York, the Bills greeted them rudely: Prescott was under duress all afternoon, Lamb had no separation from the Bills’ defenders, and the Buffalo defense was suffocating against an offense that had looked impossible to stop. Dallas finished with 10 points, but all of them came in garbage time. For Buffalo, it was as good as a shutout. The Bills’ offense had no such trouble, and the home team moved to 8-6. They will need to win at least two of their last three games to get into a playoff spot that once seemed a lock and then seemed highly unlikely. But Buffalo, at last, are on the same solid footing they seemed to be on all the time when they made the playoffs each of the past four years. Maybe there’s a future for this team yet. Perhaps the most striking part of the Bills’ dominance was that it came on a day when Josh Allen, the franchise quarterback, could not get much going with his arm. Allen only threw 15 passes and completed seven of them for 94 yards. It didn’t matter much, because the Bills’ offensive line was serving as a battering ram for talented running back James Cook. His big men blew open running gaps with abandon, and Cook ran through them with authority en route to 179 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. It was Cook’s first 100-plus-yard rushing game since 13 November; he had been an efficient option in recent games and had a career outing in this one. The second-year man from Georgia paced the offense on a day when Allen didn’t do much (and, in truth, wasn’t needed much). The Bills’ season has changed dramatically in eight days. Heading into last week’s game against the defending Super Bowl winners, the Kansas City Chiefs, the Bills were 6-6 and reeling from embarrassing revelations about coach Sean McDermott’s leadership. (Among other things, McDermott was revealed to have praised the teamwork of the 9/11 hijackers in trying to make some sort of point to his players.) But the Bills outlasted the Chiefs with some help from KC receiver Kadarius Toney, who lined up offside on what would’ve been a game-winning touchdown. And they needed no such good fortune to dismiss the Cowboys. The Bills are unlikely to win the AFC East, as the high-flying Miami Dolphins have 10 wins to their eight. And as games wrapped on Sunday, they remained, via tiebreakers, on the wrong side of the wildcard playoff picture. But they would make the playoffs if they won out, and two of their remaining three games are against the horrid Los Angeles Chargers and New England Patriots. (Both are on their second quarterback of the year, for reasons of injury or performance.) The Bills look to have cured their biggest ills, so the operative question about them is no longer what is wrong. Instead, it’s more forward-looking: How far could they go? MVP of the week Tua Tagovailoa, Miami Dolphins. Tagovailoa has developed into one of the league’s most productive passers over the past two years, but his naysayers have stayed loud anyway. Tagovailoa, detractors assume, is a mediocre quarterback who looks better because of coach Mike McDaniels’ scheme and the supernatural ability of his skill position players – mainly wideout Tyreek Hill, the league’s fastest player. Hill sat out Sunday with an ankle injury, and Tagovailoa put together a dominant effort anyway in a 30-0 rout of the woeful New York Jets. He completed 21 of 24 passes for 224 yards and a touchdown, that one to Hill’s partner-in-speed, the lightning-fast Jaylen Waddle. Tagovailoa was masterful and continued to look like a franchise quarterback on his own terms, one who certainly benefits from the greatness around him but is by no means dependent on it. If he plays half this well in January, the Dolphins are a playoff threat. He’d have had gaudier numbers on Sunday if McDaniel hadn’t shown the Jets mercy in light of the lopsided margin. Stat of the week 13. That’s how many consecutive years the New York Jets have missed the playoffs, a streak that officially grew by one when the Jets lost to Tagovailoa on Sunday and the rest of the AFC playoff picture failed to break their way. One consequence is that quarterback Aaron Rodgers seems even less likely to return this season. Rodgers has made noise since his Week 1 achilles tear about mounting a shocking early return and playing this season, out of either a desire to help the Jets, burnish his credentials as a master of healing, or both. But Rodgers has also hinted that he might not return if the Jets are not in playoff contention, and Sunday’s loss took care of that. The 5-9 Jets will probably want to try again with Rodgers in 2024, but in any event, they’ll need a better backup than the miserable Zach Wilson. Rodgers’ immediate injury may not have doomed the franchise to such a lousy season if his bosses had put a better insurance policy in place behind him. Video of the week Justin Fields’ three years in the NFL have been up and (more frequently) down, but the Chicago Bears’ young quarterback has put together a lot of nice plays of late. The story of a 20-17 loss to the Cleveland Browns was Fields making incredible plays that his pass-catchers (usually) failed to turn into anything. Case in point: a game-closing Hail Mary heave that fell into the arms of receiver Darnell Mooney, before Mooney literally kicked the ball away for a game-ending interception. There was good news, however: Maybe the finest touchdown pass of Fields’ career came in the first half, when Fields found himself under immense pressure, ran off to his right, then back to his left, and delivered a strike in the corner of the end zone to tight end Cole Kmet. The Bears must soon decide whether to pick up the fifth-year option on Fields’ rookie deal, which would extend his time under contract through 2025. With so much of the league in need of passable QB play, Fields will have value whether the Bears keep him or jettison him for a rookie like North Carolina’s Drake Maye or Southern California’s Caleb Williams. Elsewhere around the league • With impending Rookie of the Year quarterback CJ Stroud out with a concussion, the Houston Texans went on the road and beat the Tennessee Titans 19-16 on a last-second field goal in overtime by Ka’imi Fairbairn. The Texans improved their playoff position in an astonishing comeback season under first-year coach DeMeco Ryans, and their fans got a measure of revenge, too: The Titans wore throwback Houston Oilers uniforms, nodding to the identity the franchise had before it packed up and left Houston for Nashville. On Sunday, the Titans lost to the expansion franchise that replaced the Oilers in their old city. Football can, at times, be poetic. • The Atlanta Falcons slipped further into disappointment. Playing a miserable Carolina Panthers outfit that brought in a 1-12 record, the Falcons couldn’t gain traction in a Charlotte rainstorm and mustered just one touchdown drive in a 9-7 loss. Carolina’s rookie quarterback, No 1 overall pick Bryce Young, struggled immensely as usual in front of a nearly nonexistent crowd. But the Panthers’ franchise player did lead a slogging 17-play, 85-yard touchdown drive as time was winding down. Eddy Pineiro’s 23-yard field goal as the clock expired was the difference. The Falcons moved to 7-7, squandering a major chance in the race for the awful NFC South division. With the loss, head coach Arthur Smith, who went 7-10 in each of his first two seasons, made it less likely that he’d get a fourth year in the job. • The Pittsburgh Steelers, just three weeks ago, looked to be pulling off an astonishing tightrope walk. The club’s offense had been miserable, and the defense had its own problems, but the Steelers were 7-4 after a litany of mostly inexplicable victories in close games. Better yet, quarterbacks around the AFC North were dropping like flies, with only the Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson joining Pittsburgh’s Kenny Pickett among healthy starters. But everything has gone to hell in a handbasket for the Steelers, who lost back-to-back games to the last-place Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots and then, this weekend, got out to a 13-0 lead at the Indianapolis Colts before getting outscored 27-0 the rest of the way. Much of Pittsburgh’s media and fanbase now advocate for an outcome that seemed unthinkable earlier this year: splitting with future Hall of Fame coach Mike Tomlin, who won a Super Bowl in 2008 and has still never had a losing season in 16 years on the job and counting. At 7-7, that streak is in danger."
"It wasn’t a winner-takes-all game on Sunday, but the Detroit Lions had to approach it as if it was. Yes, they would have remained in the driver’s seat to win the NFC North even with a Christmas Eve loss to the Minnesota Vikings, but these Lions knew that there was no upside in letting Minnesota stay alive in the division race for another week. The Vikings, to their credit, did not make it easy for the Lions. Minnesota briefly took a 21-17 lead early in the third quarter before Detroit quarterback Jared Goff found Amon-Ra St Brown for a touchdown that put them up front. On the point after attempt, however, the Vikings managed to successfully block Michael Badgely’s kick for an extra point. This seemed like a minor detail at the time, especially after Jahmyr Gibbs ran in for the touchdown that increased Detroit’s lead to nine points. Then things got rather wobbly for the Lions. First, the Vikings cut the lead down to six with a field goal. In the game’s final drive, Minnesota quarterback Nick Mullens led his team all the way to Detroit’s 30-yard-line with the clock ticking down. Because of that failed point-after attempt, the Vikings were in a position to end the game right here without even needing to pull off a two-point conversion. Maybe in past Lions seasons, that’s how the game would have played out. When you’re a franchise that has never even made the Super Bowl, you’re used to minor mishaps snowballing into major disasters. This season, it was the other team that made the crucial error. The oft-erratic Mullens’s throw landed in the hands of Detroit cornerback Ifeatu Melifonwu for his fourth – and most painful – interception of the game. The Lions hung on to win 30-24, improving their record to 11-4. Melifonwu’s interception was literally historic. With the win, the Lions clinched the NFC North for the first time ever. The last time they won the division was in 1993, back when they were still in the NFC Central. As the broadcasters pointed out, that was before Goff was even alive. Sunday’s win over the Vikings means that Detroit’s Ford Field will host a postseason for the first time in its history. The Lions have long been one of the unluckiest NFL franchises. In their existence, they have played a grand total of 20 playoff games. More often than not, their “big game” of the year comes in November, when they play on Thanksgiving and usually lose. “This is special,” head coach Dan Campbell said after the game. “It’s something you don’t get to do all the time.” Campbell should know. In his first year, the Lions ended with a 3-13-1 record. The Lions started off their next season on a 1-6 run. Since then, however, they have been one of the best regular season teams in the league. Of course, neither he nor the Lions can afford to rest now. There’s more work to be done in Detroit: the top seed in the NFC is still technically in play, although it would depend on the San Francisco 49ers losing out. Holding onto the second seed seems like a more reasonable expectation. All of that is just postseason positioning, however. The real goal will be to accomplish something they haven’t done since 1991 and only once in 66 years: winning a playoff game. Stay tuned. MVP of the week Breece Hall, RB, New York Jets. Breece Hall did it all for the New York Jets on Sunday, putting in a 95-yard rushing performance with two touchdowns in addition to 96 receiving yards. As it turns out, the Jets needed him to have a big game, as their defense blew a 20-point halftime lead to the Washington Commanders. The Jets eventually won 30-28 on a Greg Zuerlein field goal, but it shouldn’t have come down to that. Stat of the week Three. After Sunday’s 265-yard performance against the Houston Texans, Cleveland Browns wide receiver Amari Cooper has now had 200-yard games with three separate franchises. Cooper had previously accomplished this with the then-Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys. The only other player to accomplish this was Terrell Owens, who also did it with the Cowboys, alongside the Cincinnati Bengals and San Francisco 49ers. Cooper, who also set a franchise receiving yards record, was a huge part of the Browns’ 36-22 win over the Texans. He caught two of QB Joe Flacco’s three touchdown passes as the Browns improved their record to 10-5, all but guaranteeing them a playoff spot. Video of the week It was immediately obvious that it wasn’t going to be the Dallas Cowboys’ day after their first drive of the game ended in an end zone fumble. While the Cowboys were able to take a one-point lead late, they gave Miami just enough time to kick a game-winning field goal. The Dolphins won by a final score of 22-20, meaning the Cowboys’ inability to convert field position into points early in the game ultimately came back to bite them. The Dolphins improved their record to 11-4 guaranteeing them a playoff spot and putting them in great position to win the AFC East. The 10-5 Cowboys have now lost back-to-back games and squandered a golden opportunity to at least briefly fight off the reeling Philadelphia Eagles for the top spot in the NFC East. Elsewhere around the league • In for the injured Kenny Pickett on Saturday, backup QB Mason Rudolph led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 34-11 romp over the Cincinnati to improve their odds of making the playoffs while significantly denting the Bengals’ chances. While it probably wasn’t enough to start a quarterback controversy in Pittsburgh, Rudolph’s surprisingly efficient performance means the Steelers won’t feel pressured to bring back Pickett from his ankle sprain unless he’s fully healthy. • The Buffalo Bills’ impressive run continued on Saturday, although it might be too late to prevent the 11-4 Miami Dolphins from clinching the AFC East. After their 24-22 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Bills have won four of their last five games and improved their record to 9-6. While their most likely route to the postseason will come via the wildcard, their statement wins over the Kansas City Chiefs and the Dallas Cowboys have shown that they could be a very dangerous playoff team and maybe even a dark horse Super Bowl team. • The 7-8 Green Bay Packers are still technically alive in the NFC wildcard hunt after their 33-30 win over the Carolina Panthers. Meanwhile, the Panthers’ record is now a league-worst 2-13. That’s bad news for them but great news for the Chicago Bears, who hold their first-round draft pick. At least Carolina QB Bryce Young had a solid game, throwing for two touchdowns and 312 yards in the loss. • If the Chicago Bears do end up with the top overall pick in the 2024 draft, these remaining games might determine whether they move on from Justin Fields at quarterback or not. Fields put up good but not eye-popping numbers in Chicago’s 27-16 win over the Arizona Cardinals, throwing for 170 yards and rushing for 97 while picking up a touchdown both in the air and on the ground. • The Seattle Seahawks also remain alive in the crowded NFC wildcard race, as they improved their record to 8-7 following a 20-17 win over the already eliminated Tennessee Titans. This gives Seattle an identical record as the Los Angeles Rams, who hold the tiebreaker between the two teams. This looks like it won’t be decided until the final week, which is exactly what the NFL wants. • While Fox Sports analyst Terry Bradshaw wasn’t happy with Atlanta Falcons head coach Arthur Smith’s decision to bench Desmond Ridder at quarterback in favor of Taylor Heinicke, the move paid off on Sunday. Against the Indianapolis Colts, Heinicke went 23-for-33, throwing for 229 yards and a touchdown in the 29-10 victory. The 7-8 Falcons remain technically alive in the playoff hunt, although they will need some help. • The 7-6 Denver Broncos, playing at home against a three-win New England Patriots team, had a great chance to improve their playoff odds on Sunday night. However, the Patriots offense unexpectedly exploded for 20 points in the third quarter while their defense held the Broncos offense to negative yardage. Denver managed to tie the game late in the fourth only to see its postseason hopes essentially dissipate after much-maligned Patriots kicker Chad Ryland, who missed two kicks on the evening, nailed a 56-yard field goal with two seconds left."
"The Los Angeles Chargers have fired head coach Brandon Staley and general manager Tom Telesco, the club announced on Friday. “I want to thank Tom and Brandon for their hard work, dedication and professionalism and wish both them and their great families nothing but the best,” team owner Dean Spanos said in a statement. “These decisions are never easy, nor are they something I take lightly – especially when you consider the number of people they impact. “We are clearly not where we need to be, however, and we need new vision.” The decision came down one day after the Chargers’ historic 63-21 defeat at the hands of the Las Vegas Raiders, during which they trailed 42-0 at half-time and didn’t cross midfield until the third quarter. It was the most points ever allowed by the team, who gave up 57 to the St Louis Rams on 1 October 2000. The Chargers dropped to 5-9 with Thursday’s setback, alone in last place in the AFC West. Staley – who had an overall record of 24-25 – is the third NFL coach to be fired this season, joining Josh McDaniels of the Raiders and Carolina’s Frank Reich. It is the first time since 1998 that the Chargers have made an in-season coaching move. Telesco had been the general manager since 2013. The team only made three playoff appearances under his tenure and were 86-95 overall. When the Chargers fell behind 42-0 late in the second quarter, some thought the move should have happened at half-time. “Brandon Staley. I hate to say this because you don’t ever want to call for somebody’s job, but they should fire him. They should make history. They should fire him at half-time,” Amazon Prime Video analyst Richard Sherman said. “We’ve got an Uber X carpool outside and we’ll send you on your way because right now, I’ve never seen a team come out this uninspired.” While Staley had been confident about his job security in the past, Thursday night’s titanic defeat had him questioning his future. He said “I don’t know” when asked if he would still be leading the Chargers on Friday."
"There should be something – or rather, somewhere – for almost everyone on this year’s Boxing Day racing programme, if you live in England at least. Aintree in Liverpool, arguably the country’s most famous racecourse, will join the list of venues for the first time in its history, and whether they are north (Sedgefield and Wetherby), south (Fontwell), west (Wincanton) or in the middle (Market Rasen and Wolverhampton), serious to super‑casual racing fans and those at all points in between will have a race meeting within an hour’s drive of their front door. But will they bother? It is a question that may be nagging at Kempton Park in particular because, while attendances at most of the traditional Boxing Day venues have recovered to their pre‑Covid levels, the crowd for racing’s most valuable and historic card on 26 December has not. The King George card pulled in 17,218 paying punters in 2019, and just under 20,000 a year earlier. The attendance for 2021 and 2022, however, was stuck at about 11,500. That represents a serious hole in the numbers for a track such as Kempton, which has not drawn a crowd above 3,578 for any of its 66 meetings this year. Most are all-weather Flat fixtures, staged to keep turnover rolling in betting shops and online. The track’s lowest paying attendance in 2023 was 291, for a Flat meeting in early November. When the British Horseracing Authority surveyed several thousand racegoers about a decade ago, it found that a significant majority of the sport’s audience – the punters who ensure that it is still the second-biggest spectator sport in the country – went racing once a year. It was a habit, often dating back decades, and pegged to a particular moment in the year. Boxing Day is racing’s immovable feast, a fixed point in the calendar that can be marked off a year in advance. And when any entertainment venue depends on one or two big days each season, the ticket price is only part of the equation. In much the same way that some Premier League football clubs cap the number of season tickets because once-in-a-lifetime “tourist” fans are guaranteed to max out their credit cards on merch, the annual Boxing Day punters are off the leash. They might cover the whole day off by finding a couple of decent winners, but on average they will leave a lot more behind via food, drink and betting than just the price of admission to the grandstand. If this year’s King George card cannot launch a resurgence in Kempton’s crowd figure, it may be that nothing will. Constitution Hill, quite possibly the best hurdler of all time, is due to line up in the Christmas Hurdle. The feature event, meanwhile, is guaranteed to grip the attention from start to finish, thanks in part to Shishkin’s much-documented refusal to raise a gallop when he was supposed to be getting a run under his belt at Ascot in November, but also the fact that at least three of the half-dozen starters are confirmed frontrunners. Nicky Henderson, Shishkin’s trainer, seems reasonably convinced that his runner will jump off with the field. “I’ve had some very entertaining suggestions about how we can persuade him to start,” he said at Ascot on Saturday. “I can’t personally say I’m not worried about it, of course I am, but I really don’t think it’s a big problem, I really don’t. “Someone will go down to the start with him and I just need to check with the starter what we can and cannot do. What I think you can’t do is carry anything, certainly not a Long Tom [extended whip]. If we could do that, it would be simple.” Henderson is right – use of a Long Tom at the start, which makes a noise but does not make contact, was banned by the British Horseracing Authority just a few days before Shishkin planted himself at Ascot. As a result, his backers will be gripping their betting slips as if they were clinging to a cliff edge as the starter calls them towards the tape on Tuesday. Once they are off and running, it promises to be a breathless six minutes. Allaho, the favourite, The Real Whacker, a Grade One novice chase winner at Cheltenham in March, and Frodon, the winner three years ago in front of empty stands, are habitual frontrunners that dare their opponents to match their speed and accuracy over the fences. Any mistakes by Shishkin or Bravemansgame, last year’s winner, could leave them with too much to do. The ingredients are all there for a memorable King George. We can only hope that as the leaders turn for home with three to jump, they will hear the full-throated roar from the grandstands that they deserve."
"That’s it for our coverage of a sixtastic T20 series. Congratulations to West Indies, who look like serious contenders for next year’s World Cup. England aren’t too far away either. Goodnight! Jos Buttler’s reaction We probably didn’t adapt quickly enough with the bat – I thought 16o w0uld have been a decent score on a used wicket. It was a fantastic bowling effort; we did well to hang in the game as long as we did. Phil Salt has had a brilliant series. We found out lots about ourselves as a team. [On the stop-clock experiment] It was only in the last game that we really noticed it. It’s good to keep the game moving. England’s miserable white-ball year ends with another series defeat. Plenty of good has come from this series, though, most notably the performance of Phil Salt. While there are a few slots to fill, most notably at No3, they are in reasonable shape ahead of nexr year’s World Cup. I suppose it’s appropriate that it ended with a six, the 120th of the series. Hope played a gem of an innings there, calmly anchoring West Indies in an increasingly nervous chase with a run-a-ball 43. England fought admirably to defend a below-par total; but for Hope, they would probably have done it. 19.2 overs: West Indies 133-6 (Hope 43, Holder 4) That’s it! Hope pings Woakes over extra cover for six to seal another series victory for West Indies! 19.1 overs: West Indies 127-6 (Hope 37, Holder 4) Holder inside edges Woakes this far wide of leg stump for three runs. It would have been four but for an outstanding stop from Rehan Ahmed. 19th over; West Indies 124-6 (Hope 37, Holder 1) Holder is almost run out first ball! He took a very dodgy single to mid-off and was well short of the crease when Curran just failed to gather Rashid’s throw. Nine to win from six balls, Chris Woakes to bowl them. Oh my. Russell slugs a low full toss straight down the throat of Livingstone at long-on, and England – who have been behind the game throughout this innings – are again dreaming of an improbable victory. West Indies need 10 from 7 balls. 18.4 overs: West Indies 123-5 (Hope 37, Russell 3) Sam Curran concedes only one run from the first four balls of a superb penultimate over. The ball is getting very wet, though, so there’s a short break in play while England call for a dry towel. West Indies need 10 from 8 balls. 18th over: West Indies 122-5 (Hope 36, Russell 3) Jos Buttler gambles by continuing with Rehan Ahmed, who has been relatively expensive. It doesn’t come off: Hope skims a back cut between short third and backward point for four to move the requirement back below a run a ball. It’s very hard to see how England can with this now. 17th over: West Indies 114-5 (Hope 30, Russell 1) The wicket England really need is that of Shai Hope, who is quietly guiding West Indies towards the finish line. England haven’t given this up. Powell edges Topley to short third man, where Rashid takes a smart low catch to his left. West Indies need 20 from 21 balls. 16th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 29, Powell 8) Hope, who is playing an exemplary innings, opens the face to steer Rehan for his first boundary. Rehan has struggled as the series has progressed, an d later in the over Powell muscles him over long-on for six. West Indies are 21 runs away from a hat-trick of T20 series wins this year: South Africa away, India and England at home. 15th over: West Indies 99-4 (Hope 23, Powell 1) Rashid finishes with figures of 4-0-21-2. He’s had a great series: eight wickets at 15 with an absurd economy rate of 6.26. But he’s going to end on the losing side. Buttler brings back Rashid for his final over, knowing it’s now or never for England, and gets an immediate reward. Rutherford smashes a drive towards short extra, where Curran dives to his left to take a superb catch. It’s not the despair, Laura… 14th over: West Indies 94-3 (Hope 19, Rutherford 30) West Indies are rushing towards a series victory. Rutherford hooks the new bowler Sam Curran for six more, and there are 11 from the over in total. Rutherford has 30 from 23 balls, Hope 19 from 28. They’re playing their roles to perfection. 13th over: West Indies 83-3 (Hope 17, Rutherford 21) Rehan Ahmed returns, perhaps in the hope of tempting Rutherford into one big shot too many. Instead it’s Shai Hope, who is happily playing the anchor role, who faces five of the six deliveries. England are running out of time. 12th over: West Indies 80-3 (Hope 15, Rutherford 20) England appeal unsuccessfully for caught behind when Rutherford misses a swipe at Rashid. There’s only one review left and they decide not to risk it. A good job too; there was nothing on UltraEdge. Out of nothing Rutherford launches a full ball from Rashid down the ground for six, almost knocking himself off his feet in the process. West Indies are managing an awkward chase pretty well. 11th over: West Indies 71-3 (Hope 14, Rutherford 12) After 23 balls without a West Indian boundary, Rutherford lifts Moeen handsomely over extra cover for four. That’s an excellent shot which keeps West Indies in control of the run-chase. 10th over: West Indies 62-3 (Hope 12, Rutherford 5) West Indies know how dangerous Rashid is and are content to sit on him. I think that was Charles’ plan as well, but then he saw a low full toss and his brain went rogue. Time for drinks, after which West Indies need 71 from 60 balls. Rutherford is not out! I need someone else’s glasses: it was comfortably missing leg stump and England have lost a review. ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST RUTHERFORD! This looks really close. Rutherford pushed around a legbreak from Rashid and was hit on the pad in front of middle and leg. 9th over: West Indies 58-3 (Hope 11, Rutherford 2) Moeen replaces Rehan and rushes through a pretty good over, four singles from it. West Indies are still on top but another wicket would make things very interesting. 8th over: West Indies 54-3 (Hope 9, Rutherford 0) Adil Rashid strikes straight away. On this occasion it had nothing to do with his bowling, but maybe a little to do with his aura. He accidentally bowled a very wide, dipping full toss to Charles, who clunked it low to Jos Buttler at short extra cover. 7th over: West Indies 51-2 (Charles 26, Hope 7) Rehan Ahmed’s first over disappears for 12. It started quite gently, with four singles and a two off the first five balls, but then Charles clattered a no-nonsense straight six. “We’re not going to win this, Rob,” writes Guy Hornsby. “But I’m just here to say I’m still watching for Woakes’ seam position and Rehan’s googly. That is all.” 6th over: West Indies 39-2 (Charles 16, Hope 5) Charles mistimes a short ball from Woakes just short of Moeen in the covers. In the end Moeen does well to save the boundary. This has been a good fightback by England, with only nine runs scored in the last three overs. 5th over: West Indies 37-2 (Charles 15, Hope 4) Topley continues, which makes sense because the spinners will be doing most of the work after the Powerplay, and concedes only three runs. He has quietly had a good series and is comfortably the most economical seamer on either side. 4th over: West Indies 34-2 (Charles 15, Hope 1) England needed early wickets to have a realistic chance of victory. One more in the Powerplay, before they bring on Adil Rashid, would put them right back in the game. UltraEdge shows Pooran did edge that ball from Topley – but it doesn’t matter because Woakes has got him! Pooran tried to ride the bounce of an awkward delivery that cramped him for room, took the inside of an angled bat and ricocheted onto the stumps. 3rd over: West Indies 30-1 (Charles 13, Pooran 9) Nicholas Pooran strolls to the crease and launches his second ball over midwicket for six. And why not. England thought he had edged the next ball to the keeper, though eventually they ran out of time to review. West Indies need 103 from 17 overs. “Evening Rob,” says Kim Thonger. “Jolly exciting this game, in a damaged sort of way. It occurs to me perhaps T20 internationals need a complete rebrand. May I propose we rename them Ecky Thump. The term was Introduced in Kung Fu Kapers, a 1975 episode of BBC comedy The Goodies. In the episode, ‘ecky thump’ is a secret Lancastrian martial art using black puddings as a weapon. I’m not suggesting we go as far introducing black puddings immediately. A phased withdrawal of the cricket bat will cause less fuss.” But what would you call The Hundred? Bloody Eck? One down, nine to go. Brandon King slogs Topley miles in the air towards mid-on, where Buttler takes a simple catch. 2nd over: West Indies 20-0 (King 3, Charles 13) Johnson Charles was playher of the match when West Indies beat England at the T20 World Cup 11 years ago. Charles walloped 84 off 56 balls that day, and he looks like he fancies something similar here. He pulls Woakes for a big six, albeit with a hint of top-edge, and glides a boundary past short third man. West Indies are off to a flyer. 1st over: West Indies 7-0 (King 1, Charles 2) There’s some early inswing to the right-handers for Reece Topley. Brandon King survives an LBW appeal first ball – it was missing leg – before another inswinger to Johnson Charles runs away for four leg-byes. Every boundary hurts when the target is so low, even in the first over. After a very short break, the players are back on the field. The difference two days make Tuesday, Tarouba England 267-3, 19 sixes Thursday, Taroura England 132 all out, five sixes Sam Curran clouts the next ball to long-off to end an increasingly miserable England innings. They were 109 for four after 14 overs, and then the house fell down. West Indies need 133 to win the series. Adil Rashid sacrifices himself, just like in the 2019 World Cup final, so that Curran can stay on strike. Four balls remaining. 19th over: England 129-8 (Curran 9, Rashid 1) The hat-trick ball is another attempted yorker that Rashid flicks wide of Russell for a single. He would have had three wickets in four balls had Hosein taken a tricky low chance at third man to dismiss Curran. Russell, who bowled really well, finishes with two for 25. Andre Russell is on a hat-trick! Rehan Ahmed smashed a low full toss back at Russell, who took a blinding return catch in his follow through. Goodnight. Andre Russell bowls Chris Woakes with an immaculate yorker from round the wicket, and I don’t know what else to say. It was a nigh-on perfect delivery. 18th over: England 125-6 (Curran 6, Woakes 2) Apparently dew could be a factor in the second innings, in which case Slim has left town. Just four singles from Oshane Thomas’s final over. Only Salt has scored freely in this innings, so the bowling allrounders were never likely to tee off from ball one. “Coming late to the OBO following University Challenge, I reckon England are preparing to insure themselves by having two keepers opening,” writes John Starbuck. “If one of them comes off big, the other could take the gloves after having. his feet up for a while: a very cunning plan. “Meanwhile, my last attempt to get the OBO fans have a treat with the Quicksilver Messenger Service’s version of ‘Mona’ which I’ve been playing a lot in this series.” 17th over: England 121-6 (Curran 4, Woakes 0) Motie ends a fine spell with figures of 4-0-24-3, and a fine series with an economy rate of just 7.37. Erm, about those 40 runs England need. The man most likely to get them, Liam Livingstone, has just checked a return catch to Gudakesh Motie. The ball stopped in the pitch, another sign of its awkwardness, and Livingstone is on his way for a useful 29-ball 28. 16th over: England 120-5 (Livingstone 28, Curran 3) Livingstone picks Holder up over square leg for his second six, a seemingly effortless blow. The rest of the over is a bit of a struggle for both batsmen, with a number of false strokes. On this pitch England’s score isn’t as modest as it looks, but they will want at least 40 off the last four overs. 15th over: England 111-5 (Livingstone 21, Curran 1) Hosein ends an excellent spell with figures of 4-0-20-2. He’s had a strong series overall, with an outstanding economy rate of 7.8. A useful, if chancy, innings from Moeen Ali comes to an end. He charged Hosein, who saw him coming and pushed the ball shorter and wider. Moeen smeared it towards long-on, where Russell and Powell completed a relay catch. Russell’s throw almost fell short of Powell, who had to dive forward to clasp the ball with both hands. 14th over: England 109-4 (Livingstone 20, Moeen 23) Moeen tries to pull Russell and somehow edges the ball to the left of Pooran for four. Every little helps. Moeen then misses a slower bouncer and top-edges another pull that lands safely. A terrific over from Russell – seven from it, but five came from false strokes. “Gary Naylor’s comment about Salt looking like Maxwell is something I’d been thinking about,” writes Tom Van der Gucht. “Salt seems to have one of those faces that make him look like lots of famous people from different angles. From some perspectives he looks like Ian Bell on steroids, from others he has a ring of the actor Jamie Dornan and sometimes he gives off definite Matt Prior vibes.” That’s a perceptive point. There are also quite a few pictures in which he resembles our deputy digital editor Gregg Bakowski. 13th over: England 102-4 (Livingstone 18, Moeen 18) Moeen joins Club Maximum, hoicking Motie miles over midwicket. That’s England’s fourth six of the match and their 55th of the series. The usual ones and twos make it another excellent over for England. 12th over: England 90-4 (Livingstone 16, Moeen 8) It’s fair to say Liam Livingstone enjoys pace on the ball. When Oshane Thomas returns to the attack, Livingstone launches a typical fast-handed six over midwicket. Moeen has a stroke of luck when a top-edged pull lands safely, but that’s a much better over for England – ten from it. 11th over: England 80-4 (Livingstone 8, Moeen 6) Livingstone, who is taking a bit of time to get used to the pitch, takes a couple of singles off Hosein to move to eight from 13 balls. England have scored only 11 runs from the last three overs. 10th over: England 77-4 (Livingstone 6, Moeen 5) Another boundaryless over, this time from Jason Holder. England are starting to lose their way, though I must stress that the pitch looks pretty awkward. Drinks. 9th over: England 73-4 (Livingstone 5, Moeen 2) Terrific stuff from Motie – just three runs and the wicket. England’s spinners will fancy bowling on this, but only if they have something to defend. Two wickets in four balls for Gudakesh Motie! Brook tried to lap a ball that bounced to hit the glove and loop into the hands of Nicholas Pooran behind the stumps. This pitch is offering plenty to the spinners. 8th over: England 70-3 (Livingstone 4, Brook 7) Brook is beaten by a grubber from Russell, then throws his head back in surprise when the next ball kicks from a length. This certainly isn’t another 267 pitch. It might not be a 167 pitch. A low full toss from Russell allows Brook to free his mind of uneven bounce and calmly wave his first boundary back down the ground. 7th over: England 61-3 (Livingstone 1, Brook 1) “It’s just struck me that, under the lid, “Phil Salt looks a bit like Glenn Maxwell under the lid,” says Gary Naylor. “Bats a bit like him too.” His numbers for this series are bonkers: 331 runs at 83 with a strike-rate of 186. A huge wicket for West Indies! For the second time in three overs, an England batter is dismissed the ball after hitting a six. Salt had launched Gudakesh Motie over wide mid-off for his first six of the match and his 22nd of the series. Motie’s response was a beautiful delivery that curved onto middle stump and straightened dramatically to beat Salt’s defensive push. That is a jaffa. 6th over: England 50-2 (Salt 31, Livingstone 1) Salt takes Thomas for successive boundaries, through backward point and then straight down the ground. In doing so, he breaks Mohammad Rizwan’s record for the most runs in a bilateral T20 series. Rizwan made 316 against England last year; Salt has 324 and counting. ”If Phil Salt keeps batting like this,” says Brian Withington, “I might just about be persuaded that he is worth his place in spite of the truly awful wicketkeeping. Is he stepping in just to make us grateful for the return of Jos ‘Tin Gloves’ Buttler?!” 5th over: England 39-2 (Salt 21, Livingstone 0) That was the last ball of the over. Jacks has had a frustrating series. A strike-rate of 146 is excellent; the problem is that his average is one decimal point away: 73 runs at 14.60. Brilliant bowling from Akeal Hosein! The ball after being slugged down the ground for six by Will Jacks, Hosein skidded a quicker ball through to hit the stumps as Jacks shaped to cut. Shane Warne would have been proud of that. 4th over: England 32-1 (Salt 20, Jacks 1) Buttler ends a decent series with 161 runs at an average of 32, and with a strike-rate of 144. Meanwhile Salt, the leading runscorer on either side by a mile, gets four more with a deft steer to third man. As Ian Bishop notes on TNT Sports, West Indies are bowling very straight and so far England have struggled to time the ball. A strength can also be a weakness, part 437241. Jos Buttler premeditates a ramp off Jason Holder’s second ball but scoops it straight to short fine leg, where Oshane Thomas takes a simple catch. 3rd over: England 24-0 (Salt 13, Buttler 11) The left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein, who has opened the bowling throughout the series, comes on first change tonight. Salt makes room to crack another boundary through the covers. Rutherford hurt himself while diving to try to stop the ball; for a second I thought he’d dislocated a finger but he seems to be okay. Salt takes a very tight single to Holder at mid-off – it would have been very close with a direct hit – and then Buttler mistimes a big shot that plops short of long-on. The early signs are that this pitch isn’t quite as conducive to batting thuggery as it was on Tuesday. 2nd over: England 16-0 (Salt 7, Buttler 9) Oshane Thomas, playing his first T20I in two years, starts with a wide half-volley that is laced through extra cover for four by Salt. His line is much tighter thereafter, but when he drops short Buttler heaves a pull through midwicket for four more. No sixes, yet. 1st over: England 5-0 (Salt 1, Buttler 4) Russell hasn’t opened the bowling in a T20 international since 2018. His third ball is a wretched half-tracker that Buttler pulls past short fine leg for four, but that aside it’s a decent over. The players are on the field and Andre Russell is going to open the bowling. Let us flay. The match starts in precisely 20 minutes. Here’s something to read while I watch Luke Littler grab a coffee England are unchanged. West Indies bring in Johnson Charles and Oshane Thomas for Kyle Mayers and Matthew Forde, which means a return to the King Charles opening partnership. Shame they don’t have a player with the surname Ralph. West Indies King, Charles, Hope, Pooran, Rutherford, Powell, Motie, Russell, Holder, Hosein, Thomas. England Salt (wk), Buttler (c), Jacks, Livingstone, Brook, Ali, Curran, Woakes, Ahmed, Rashid, Topley. Jos Buttler says he would have done the same, though batting first wasn’t a problem for England on Tuesday night. All good orgies must come to an end. The T20 series between West Indies and England has been a bacchanalia of six-hitting: 108 in four games, obliterating the record for a bilateral series. Expect at least another 25 in tonight’s decider in Tarouba. And then, just like that, the series – and one of the more eventful years in English cricket history – will be over. England’s comeback from 2-0 down has been built on two spectacular centuries from Phil Salt. No longer is he living up to his initials by being an afterthought in England’s white-ball sides. Salt has been the biggest triumph of this series, making what Matthew Mott called an “undeniable case” for inclusion in the team at next year’s World Cup. Adil Rashid has been majestic, even by his standards, and is top of the T20 rankings for the first time in his career, while Rehan Ahmed, Liam Livingstone and Sam Curran are among those who have done their World Cup chances more harm than good. This series is ultimately about finessing England’s team for when they return in June, so a defeat wouldn’t be the end of the world. But a comeback win would make a statement that, after a traumatic year, England’s white-ball team are back to their old ways: knocking the opposition for six."
"It’s the most wonderful time of the year … Spoty season! Britain’s sporting hero or heroine of 2023 has been whittled down to six nominees by a panel of judges including the Euro 2022 winner Ellen White, the former Olympian Colin Jackson and the Paralympian Ellie Simmons. The winner, decided by a public vote, will be crowned at Tuesday’s ceremony, with Clare Balding, Gary Lineker, Gabby Logan and Alex Scott presenting live from Manchester as the award celebrates its 70th anniversary. Here are the six nominees. Mary Earps The bookies’ favourite to become just the 15th solo female winner, a win for Earps would see a second consecutive award for a Lioness, after Beth Mead claimed the 2022 prize. While personality is not a qualifying factor for Spoty, Earps has it in spades: she was standout performer to help England to the World Cup final, where she produced one of the most iconic sporting moments of the year, brilliantly saving a penalty from Spain’s Jenni Hermoso before promptly yelling ‘fucking yes, fuck off!’ as the cameras zoomed in on her euphoric face. There was uproar when the 30-year-old’s England goalkeeping shirt was not made available by Nike before and during the World Cup. More than 170,000 people signed a petition in protest, and Nike later reversed its decision, with the £100 jersey selling out in hours. Rory McIlroy McIlroy’s return to form has been a welcome one, even if his major drought is now going to be extended to a 10th year. The Northern Irishman fell agonisingly short at the US Open, one shot behind winner Wyndham Clark, but has had plenty of on-course success. McIlroy hit arguably the shot of the year – a 2-iron into wind to 10 feet – to make birdie and win the Scottish Open on the 72nd hole, while his flawless performance in the Ryder Cup led Europe to a tearful victory over the USA. McIlroy’s return to the No 1 ranking in February has added weight to his off-course comments against LIV and the civil war that has engulfed golf in 2023, where he has become a leader, talisman and elder statesman of the game at 34. Katarina Johnson-Thompson Is Katarina Johnson-Thompson the best all-round athlete in the world? The Liverpool-born heptathlete won her second world title in August, a most unlikely comeback after injury – a torn achilles and torn calf – blighted the last few years of her career. But the British public love an underdog story and Johnson-Thompson delivered lifetime bests in the shot put and javelin to claim victory. The 30-year-old is now targeting her first Olympic gold next year in Paris but knows from experience the pitfalls of elite sport, symbolised by her tattoo of a blue shell from the Mario Kart game over her achilles scar. “When life is going too well, a blue shell can always be hovering around the corner to take you out,” she explained. Frankie Dettori Speaking of comebacks, here comes Frankie, British horse racing’s adopted son turned father figure. The Italian jockey is one of only two non-Brits to have scaled the Spoty podium (with New Zealand speedway star Barry Briggs, who was second twice in the 1960s). In the past Dettori has never got closer than his third-place finish in 1996. In 2023, Dettori has had a wild year to match his persona: a farewell tour, a retirement U-turn, and a victorious and dramatic final hurrah at Champions Day at Ascot (where his newly-built statue now stands), prevailing in the Champion Stakes in his final ride on British soil, adding to his wins in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, the Coronation Cup triumph at Epsom and two Classics victories. Alfie Hewett In terms of titles won, Hewett is the runaway leader here. The wheelchair tennis player is a phenomenon, winning seven singles tournaments, including two majors, and only narrowly missing out on a third grand slam title at Wimbledon. Ranked No 1 in singles, he and Gordon Reid also claimed three of the four doubles majors on offer in Australia, France and SW19, while Hewett played a pivotal part in Great Britain’s World Team Cup glory. Already an OBE at the age of 26, Hewett could become the first para-athlete to win Spoty – Tanni Grey-Thompson and Jonnie Peacock finished third in 2000 and 2017 respectively. Stuart Broad Sporting legacies are not just constructed by scores, numbers and titles but moments and memories, especially in cricket: Andrew Flintoff consoling Brett Lee at Edgbaston, Shane Warne’s Ball of the Century, Monty Panesar and Jimmy Anderson’s last-wicket stand. Broad cemented his own legacy with a stunning farewell in the final Ashes Test after the shock announcement of his retirement. Having scored a six with his last ball as a batter, he took the final wicket of the match to give England victory, ending with 604 career Test wickets. Broad did not have a perfect year, but few can doubt his legend in an England shirt and there were no finer finishes than at the sun-drenched Oval in July. A spot of bother … Spoty has always been contentious. Roger Bannister was snubbed in the first-ever award in 1954 for his pacemaker, Chris Chataway. This year, similarly, there were some omissions from the main shortlist that caused a stir. Josh Kerr, Britain’s remarkable 1500m world champion, told the Guardian last week he was “massively disappointed” not to be nominated. The World Athletics president, Seb Coe, was slightly more forthright: “Are you having a laugh, Spoty?” he tweeted. Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham has a claim after becoming arguably the best male footballer in the world, while Ronnie O’Sullivan celebrated his eighth UK snooker championship three days before his 48th birthday, making him both the youngest and oldest winner of the event. Follow it live with Barry Glendenning at theguardian.com or watch on BBC One from 7pm GMT on Tuesday, iPlayer or the BBC Sport website.

"It was, in the words of Michael van Gerwen, no better than “OK”. And of course when you are the three-time world title winner and one of the greats of the sport you pitch your standards higher than most. Even so there was a vaguely stirring quality to this second-round demolition of Keane Barry, a 3-0 victory secured with just two legs dropped. It’s hard to put your finger on what exactly. The roars and the fist-pumps were a little more bullish than usual, the gaze a little more focused. There was a sublime 167 checkout that was basically an act of pure will, eliciting an explosion of noise from the Ally Pally crowd and completely reversing the course of a set that the Irishman was threatening to nick. And then there was the doubling: a 60% checkout rate, which allied to a 98.17 average gave this performance an air of authority and ruthlessness that has been conspicuously lacking in many of his outings this year. “He’s a guy who can never show his best game on television,” Van Gerwen had said dismissively of Barry shortly after the draw was made. Barry himself had cryptically referred to “a few issues at home” by way of explaining his difficult couple of years since bursting on to the scene as the world youth champion in 2020 and securing a tour card in 2021. All the runes pointed to a humbling. But here Barry, who is 21, did pretty much show his best game on television, or at least something close to it. He actually had more darts at double than Van Gerwen, hit more 180s, averaged a competitive 95.81. A little more poise on the outer ring would have made this a very different game. Instead Van Gerwen, supercharged by his 167, surged home by winning six successive legs. “With the finishing I’m pleased,” Van Gerwen said. “The scoring isn’t there yet, so that’s a little bit disappointing. But the important thing is I won the first game. There’s a lot of pressure on me.” We’ve now seen all four of the tournament favourites in action. What have we learned? Luke Humphries has probably shown the most frailty, wobbling to a sketchy victory against Lee Evans, and is no longer the bookmakers’ favourite. Michael Smith looked impressive in an epic test against Kevin Doets on opening night. Gerwyn Price was his usual imperious self against Connor Scutt. Van Gerwen, meanwhile, looked as consistently good as any of them. If his troubles with the doubles really are at an end, then he and Price are probably the players to beat. But if one legend of the game looks to be strengthening, then another is listing. Are the lights slowly dimming on James Wade? Is The Machine on the blink? This was the second year in a row that he exited at his first hurdle, as he became the first seed to be pipped at this year’s tournament. And in his narrow defeat against Matt Campbell of Canada, the world No 13 demonstrated the same frailties and limitations that have led to his slow slide from the world’s elite. He’s never won this title, a source of enormous regret to him, and sad to say, it’s hard to see him ever doing so. In truth, this had been coming for a while. Simply put, Wade no longer pounds the 60-bed in the industrial quantities that took him to 11 major titles and a place among the genuine greats of the sport. For a long time these were cracks papered over by his world-class finishing, the nerve and nous accumulated over a lifetime in the sport. But when you are consistently putting in 90-95 averages, somebody will eventually take you out. For Campbell, a likable welder from Hamilton, this was by far the greatest win of his career. As for Wade, where he goes from here is anyone’s guess. He’s only 40, still hungry, and when it all comes together – as in his run to the European Championship final in October – he can still beat anybody. But this defeat will probably lead to him dropping out of the world’s top 20, and newer younger challengers are circling him like sharks. On day five we saw a few of them in action: the heavy-scoring Mike De Decker of Belgium was ominously good in a destruction of Dragutin Horvat; Ricardo Pietreczko of Germany, one of the year’s breakthrough stars, ended the last female participation in the tournament by beating Mikuru Suzuki in straight sets. In the day’s first match was the latest blow for the international contingent, as Tomoya Goto of Japan beating the veteran Ian White. Then there was the youngest, hippest swinger in town; albeit a swinger aged 59 who has just announced that next year will be his last as a professional. Steve Beaton began his 33rd consecutive world championship campaign with a raucous victory against Wessel Nijman of the Netherlands, flinging five 180s and setting up a second-round tie against Daryl Gurney. The Bronzed Adonis is – finally – leaving the building. But not before he’s played a few of the old hits."
"Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is questionable for Monday night’s game at Seattle because of an illness, a person familiar with his status told the Associated Press on Sunday. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity because the injury report hasn’t been released yet, said Hurts will travel separately from the team. Marcus Mariota is Hurts’ presumptive back-up should he not be able to play. The Eagles (10-3) have lost two straight games but would secure the NFC East title if they beat the Seahawks (6-7) and win their final three games. Additionally, Matt Patricia is replacing Sean Desai as the defensive play-caller for Philadelphia, multiple sources reported on Sunday. Desai will continue his role as defensive coordinator but is moving to the booth, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team hasn’t announced the switch. Patricia, a three-time Super Bowl champion as a defensive coach with the New England Patriots and a former head coach with the Detroit Lions, joined the Eagles as a senior defensive assistant this year after Desai replaced Jonathan Gannon as the defensive coordinator. The Eagles have allowed 109 points over the past three games."
"Michael Smith got his title defence up and running at the PDC World Darts Championship – but he was pushed all the way by Kevin Doets as the tournament began at Alexandra Palace. Doets, the world No 66, had overcome Stowe Buntz 3-0 in Friday’s opening match and looked a dangerous opponent for Smith. The world No 1 began by breaking his opponent’s throw to take the first set 3-1 – but Doets hit back to level in the second. The Dutchman had maintained an average of more than 100 over the first two sets, and he continued that form in the third set, holding throw in the deciding leg to put Smith under huge pressure. Smith, looking to become only the third player to retain his PDC world title, pounced to level at two sets each after Doets missed two darts at double 16. In the first leg of the decider, Smith hit a 142 checkout to break throw and apparently take control of the match. The St Helens star, who won his first Ally Pally title in January with a 7-4 victory over Michael van Gerwen, then showed signs of nerves by missing five match darts – but nailed double top on his own throw to get over the line with a 100.49 average. “I nearly threw it away a couple of times,” Smith told Sky Sports. “I had to keep battling and keep fighting. I didn’t want to go to a last-leg decider, [but] I managed to fall over the line.” The 33-year-old has endured an inconsistent season after his maiden world crown, but insisted that defending the title brought extra pressure. “Driving up to Alexandra Palace, I felt the same nerves I felt last year, and have felt here every year,” he said. Simon Whitlock came through a five-set battle of his own against Paolo Nebrida of the Philippines. Both players struggled to hit doubles in a tight contest, but the former finalist Whitlock checked out on double four in the deciding set to set up a second-round meeting with Gary Anderson on Saturday evening. Elsewhere, Scotland’s Cameron Menzies beat Rusty-Jake Rodriguez of Austria 3-0. Menzies, who had spent most of Friday at his day job as a plumber, hit 50% of his doubles and will face the No 11 seed, Dave Chisnall, on Saturday afternoon. “I was working but it kind of chilled me out, it made me realise that darts is a hobby and a very lucky one, too,” Menzies said afterwards. “I was so nervous, I knew that game meant a lot. What happens now is a bonus but winning that game meant the world to me.” The world No 63 will now hope that his girlfriend, Fallon Sherrock, can also progress past the first round on Monday night. Menzies added that he was happy to avoid Sherrock, who made history with her run to the third round in 2020, in the draw. “I play Fallon in the house and I beat her eight times out of 10 but she has moments when she smashes me, which is fair enough,” the 34-year-old said. “I know for a fact up there on the stage she would batter me. It’s her stage, she would batter me.”"
"The bounce of a rugby ball can change everything, as Munster found to their cost in Devon. One minute the Irish province were looking in absolute command of a Champions Cup fixture they badly needed to win, the next they were heading home seriously downcast after a game transformed by another remarkable late surge from a re-energised young Chiefs team still unbeaten in Pool Three. When Munster led 24-13 entering the final quarter they seemed all but safe, only for Exeter’s bench to replicate the Houdini act they performed in Toulon in the opening round. First the back-row forward Ross Vintcent stretched over for a close-range try to reignite the contest and then, a couple of minutes later, the replacement scrum-half Stu Townsend lobbed a hopeful box kick into space on the edge of the Munster 22. Calvin Nash, scorer of his side’s first try, allowed it to bounce and the former Leinster forward Jack Dunne came charging into view to poach it. To Munster’s horror the lanky lock kept rumbling all the way to the try-line and Exeter were ahead for the first time. An interception score from the in-form Henry Slade in the 79th minute compounded Irish pain to earn the Chiefs an additional pre‑Christmas bonus via their fourth try. Rob Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby, revealed afterwards his players had joked in the dressing room that it was Dunne’s first decent catch for the season, while his opposite number, Graham Rowntree, described the whole episode as “crazy”. It leaves Munster, who have now failed to win in three visits to Devon, without a win from their opening two pool games, with a trip to Toulon and a home game against unbeaten Northampton still to come. “I’m hugely frustrated,” Rowntree said, unhappy with his side’s fraying second-half composure. “We are the world specialists in making life tough for ourselves.” It was certainly a gripping, seesawing contest, with Exeter having initially looked anything but likely winners. Munster’s analysts had clearly identified potential space on the edges of their hosts’ rush defence and the visitors duly scored three times in the same right-hand corner in the first half. For their opening score Craig Casey threw a huge pass out to the unmarked Nash before a neat cross-kick from Jack Crowley sent the athletic blindside flanker Tom Ahern charging over from almost 50 metres at a seriously impressive gallop. Things improved even more for the visitors when more deft midfield work cleared the way for Antoine Frisch, once of Bristol, to burst down the same right touchline. Exeter did manage one first-half try, when Dan Frost rewarded a decent period of home pressure with a close‑range score, but were being opened up too often for comfort by a Munster side also enjoying the bulk of the territory and possession. It was hard fought, though, as it was always destined to be. There is more that unites these two teams than divides them – regional pride, rural passion, no-nonsense attitudes – and a physical edge was guaranteed on a mostly grey, still afternoon. Munster were also indebted to the long arms and strength of their international lock Tadhg Beirne, who came up with a crucial turnover on his side’s line after an overenthusiastic Tom Cairns had opted for a quick tap penalty. Exeter, though, had fought their way back from 18-5 down beside the Mediterranean the previous week, and still declined to lie down even after Munster scored again, more smart play from Frisch down the middle eventually stretched the cover sufficiently to put the full-back Shane Daly over, again down the Chiefs’ left side. Maybe there was a Irish assumption that the hard work had been done. If so, they were greatly mistaken. Baxter’s decision to make mass changes bore spectacular fruit and Munster were suddenly confronted with a very different beast. First Vintcent and then the opportunistic Dunne combined to get the crowd roaring again before Slade, who finished with 17 points, swooped to apply the late coup de grace. Munster were unhappy with the awarding of the final try, with Beirne engaging in prolonged arm-waving debate with the French referee Matthieu Raynal, but Baxter was keener to dwell on Slade’s consistently excellent contributions this season. “He’s training and playing like a young man,” Baxter said. “I can’t ask any more of him. He’s playing in the way he played to get an international cap. You can just tell he’s a big game player.” Vanes hat-trick as Leicester hold on to beat Stade Archie Vanes scored a hat-trick of tries as Leicester withstood late pressure to seal a battling 27-24 victory at Stade Français in the Champions Cup. The win, which came via a 66th-minute penalty from Jamie Shillcock, helped the Tigers extend their unbeaten record in Pool Four of the competition. Shillcock finished with 12 points with the boot, while the Paris side’s tries came from Mathieu Hirigoyen, Charles Laloi and Léo Barré. Leicester had fashioned a 14-7 advantage at half-time through Vanes’ first two tries which were both converted by Shillcock. The hosts seized the momentum at the start of the second half, with Laloi crossing in the corner within one minute of the restart. Vanes’ third try of the night helped Leicester hold their nerve and edge back in front in the contest with 54 minutes on the clock. Once again Stade Français fought back and appeared to have wrested the momentum when they scored to level the match with 20 minutes to go. But Shillcock’s 66th-minute penalty nudged Leicester back in front and they withstood fierce pressure from the home side in the closing stages."
"Here’s Geoff’s report from the MCG. See you back here for day five! An astounding end to an extraordinary day in an amazing Test. India threw the first punch of day four, popping the bubble of new sensation Sam Konstas who got an unplayable peach from – who else? – Jasprit Bumrah and walked off for eight. With Australia’s teen talisman gone, India went on a tear before a roaring crowd that has now reached a record high of over 299,000 over the four days. Mohammed Siraj got rid of Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja before Bumrah blasted out Travis Head (1), Mitchell Marsh (0) and Alex Carey (2). At 91 for 6, Australia looked shot. But two first innings heroes came to the rescue: Marnus Labuschagne scrapped his way to another 70 and captain Pat Cummins added to his 49 with a fighting 41. The home side got to 148 before India surged back into the contest. Cummins holes out, Mitchell Starc ran himself out and Australia looked down and out at 173 for 9. Enter the unlikely 10th wicket partnmers of Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland. Through guile, luck and courage they inched Australia to a lead of 300 and then went past it. Their extraordinary 55-run partnership for the 10th wicket has Australia 333 runs ahead. And given the highest score ever chased at the MCG which was 332 back in December 1928, it puts Australia in the box seat to win this fourth Test and take a 2-1 lead into the final match in Sydney. But it ain’t over til it’s over. And this Test series has twisted and turned like few others. Will Australia’s fast bowlers roll through India tomorrow – or will the niggles to Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Marsh leave them hamstrung? Or can India mount yet another fightback and steal the Test – and the series – with a record-chasing run chase? Join us tomorrow to find out. One thing’s for sure: it’ll be a day to remember. 82nd over: Australia 228-9 (Lyon 41, Boland 10) Last ocer of the day. Who you gonna call? Jasprit Bumrah. He tosses up a fat full toss and Nathan Lyon clubs it square for FOUR. Probably the worst ball of the series by Bumrah. He’s tired and needs a hot thali and a cold Kingfisher. Bumrah errs again with a no ball and then Lyon steers a short ball through midwicket for two. And now high farce… an edge, a catch between the knees, a brief celebration and then dropped heads as the umpire calls no-ball. There goes Bumnrah’s five-for. And judt when India think it can;’t get any worse Lyon salts the wound with a whack over midwicket that brings up the fifty partnership. Remarkable. And Lyon adds an absurd full stop to an extraordinary day by edging for FOUR. Ouch! 81st over: Australia 214-9 (Lyon 29, Boland 10) India has the new ball but seems they want Jasprit Bumrah to bowl with it next over. Instead Akash Deep gets a final whirl with the old cherry which is showing hints of reverse swing. Lyon doesn’t care. He drives another single. I stand corrected. With Boland on strike India take the new ball. Boland deflects a single to third man to go into double figures. And Lyon leans into the next and tonks FOUR down the ground. Stirring stuff from Australia’s tail! 80th over: Australia 207-9 (Lyon 23, Boland 9) Sundar enters his fourth over and Boland notches his 63rd ball survived. That’s the 80th over up in this innings. Will India bring back Bumrah for a final blast with the new ball? 79th over: Australia 206-9 (Lyon 21, Boland 9) Akash Deep returns to the attack and crashes it into Boland’s pad first ball. This looks close. Umpire says ‘Nah’ but India think ‘Yeah’ and sends it to the higher powers. No dice. It’s going down leg. Scott Boland breathes a little easier but not as deeply as India’s opening batters. There’s no way they want to face a Mitchell Starc over tonight. 78th over: Australia 206-9 (Lyon 21, Boland 9) Lyon slogs for FOUR! Jadeja put it on off stump and the old man from Young jumped out and put it through square leg. With 20 minutes left in the day’s play, Australia may be about to smash and grab their way to a couple of nasty Cummins-Starc overs in the shadow of stumps. 77th over: Australia 200-9 (Lyon 17, Boland 8) India bring on Washington Sundar but it can’t slow Australia’s inexorable crawl past 200. A Lyon single brings it up and takes the partnership to 27. Australia lead by 306. 76th over: Australia 199-9 (Lyon 16, Boland 8) Boland plays out another Jadeja over as he reaches then breaches his longest Test innings – 48 balls and eight runs. And he’s done yet. 74th over: Australia 197-9 (Lyon 15, Boland 7) Lyon edges Jadeja for a single. Neither side minds that. Can Boland carve another boundary. He has now faced more deliveries than Nathan Lyon and looks set for a big score – maybe even double figures. The only one who wants this final wicket more than India is my greyhound who is waiting for a break in play to be fed the last of his Christmas turkey. Sorry Bailey, blame Mr Boland. 73rd over: Australia 196-9 (Lyon 14, Boland 7) Lyon drives Siraj down the ground for a single leaving Boland to CUT FOR FOUR! That takes the Australian lead over 300. That is huge. This partnership has been worth 23 runs – every one them could prove golden. That hurt Siraj. He has 3-66 but still has a face angrier than a bulldog chewing a wasp. 72nd over: Australia 191-9 (Lyon 13, Boland 3) Bumrah to Boland. It sounds like a mismatch but the Australian No 11 has now hung tough for 30 balls. Bouncer. Yorker. Off stump, leg stump. Big Scotty survives it all. 71st over: Australia 191-9 (Lyon 13, Boland 3) A single to Lyon as Siraj strays. Boland cops a bouncer and flinches enough to pop it up. Luckily it comes down short of gully. Good bowling. It baffles me why India haven’t tried the chin music before to these two. Boland glances a single and takes a run which a direct hit would’ve ended the innings. 70th over: Australia 189-9 (Lyon 12, Boland 2) Bumrah barrels in and puts one on Lyon’s leg stump. His flick of the bat misses but there’s enough pad for a leg bye. Can Boland survive five Bumrah balls? Yes. He. Can. Gervase Greene has emailed to urge that we “officially drop the pretence that Cummins is not a genuine all-rounder? In the last year - and while captain, curiously - he has jettisoned the dour, but solid blocker propping up the tail. He can now accelerate the rate as required, not only keep out - but score from - even top-notch bowling. And most pertinently, he can flick these switches at will, depending on what the team requires. He is a marvel. A marvel he is, Gervase. And may yet prove it with a final burst this evening. 69th over: Australia 188-9 (Lyon 12, Boland 2) Time for another jet-fueled Jadeja over. And a little Nathan Lyon luck as he late cuts inches away from Rohit Sharma and steals a run. Blocker Boland survives a 14th ball as Australia lead by 293 runs. 68th over: Australia 186-9 (Lyon 10, Boland 2) Guess who’s back? Bumrah. Australia are creeping toward a lead of 300 and to reach that number would inflict an important psychological blow. Can India’s main man stop these bunnies from breeding 10 more runs? Lyon and Boland edge closer with two leg byes. And Lyon’s drive and Nitish’s misfield at mid-on adds another. These two have put on 14 runs for the 10th wicket. There’s a muted shout for lbw and a middlin review on the last but it’s way wide. 67th over: Australia 184-9 (Lyon 10, Boland 2) Spinner on spinner as Jadeja zips into Lyon. The Australian gets the better of the encounter, dabbing to backward point. He calls for two and it pressures the fielder into a fumble so he gets them. Then a single. And now more frustration for India as Boland’s cheeky single becomes a chancer’s two when the throw ricochets for an overthrow. The people’s hero is off the mark! Australia lead by 289. 66th over: Australia 176-9 (Lyon 8, Boland 0) Lyon is DROPPED! He was caught on the hop by a Siraj slower ball and tentatively popped it up at eye level. Siraj blinked at the wrong split second and spilt the chance. India have grassed four today by my count. Will it cost them in the long run? Siraj thunders one into Lyon’s pad and screams for an upraised finger from the umpire. It doesn’t come but Sharma shrugs and reviews. Unsurprisingly it’s sailing down leg side. Lyon celebrates by carving the fourth ball into the covers for three. 65th over: Australia 174-9 (Lyon 5, Boland 0) Here comes Australia’s No 11, local hero and Johnny Mullagh medallist 2021, Scott “Blocker” Boland. Jadeja gifts Australia a no-ball but Blocker blocks the rest to make it a wicket and five dots. Edged and caught! Cummins goes after another fine innings. Jadeja put it outside off and it gripped a fraction and Cummins’ artful steer became a top edge. That’s a crucial wicket but it gives Australia’s skipper time to put his feet up for a bit and prepare a plan for young master Jaiswal who has dropped three catches today and maybe isn’t feeling too lucky. 64th over: Australia 173-8 (Cummins 41, Lyon 5) We have 41,448 in the MCG and every one of them is on the edge of their seat. Lyon scampers a leg bye from Siraj’s first ball and gives back the strike to Cummins who cuts fine for another two to enter the roaring 40s. Great stuff from Cummins who, after 49 in the first innings, is now entering the rarified air of the full-fledged allrounder. And now he swings hard and high. Two there but he takes one to keep strike. Australia lead by 278. 63rd over: Australia 169-8 (Cummins 38, Lyon 5) Cummins steers a Bumrah yorker to third man. There’s a run there but he doesn’t takes it, preferring to protect the GOAT. Jasprit now gives him a bouncer to think about and the skipper takes evasive action. Then a yorker. Cummins is up to the challenge of both, knowing Bumrah can’t bowl forever. And now a little counterattack, leaning back and cutting to the rope for FOUR. 62nd over: Australia 165-8 (Cummins 34, Lyon 5) Lyon edges for FOUR. Streaky but sweet for Australia. Mohammed Siraj adds another furrow to his well corrugated brow. Rohit Sharma has come alive as a captain this afternoon. Despite criticism of his leadership and a shocking run of form with the bat, he has injected his spearhead Bumrah with acumen and fired up Siraj to take three wickets. Not only is the Test and series in the balance, Sharma’s career might be too. 61st over: Australia 161-8 (Cummins 34, Lyon 1) After a break for drinks, Jasprit Bumrah – refreshed and ready to bowl – steams in. Will Pat Cummins spurn singles to protect Nathan Lyon or will he trust the man with whom he orchestrated that famous victory at Edgbaston? There they put on 55 runs for the ninth wicket to secure victory in the first Ashes Test. Can they conjure more glory for Australia here? Not yet. It’s a maiden. 60th over: Australia 161-8 (Cummins 34, Lyon 1) Siraj returns – face full of zinc, head full of steam. New batter Nathan Lyon flicks off the pads to get off the mark. Cummins does well to drop a bouncer at his feet. The next one is wide and Cummins opens the blade and runs it through gully for three more. Australia lead by 266 runs. Starc is GORN! The umpire went tot the replay but Starc walked. He knew he was well short of his ground. Dreadful mix-up by the Australian pair and probably Starc’s fault. He turned too quick for the second when Cummins, with a clear view of the swooping Nitish, cancelled it with a bark. But too late. Starc was well short of his ground and veered out of the path of the ball when he should’ve have tried to wear it on the body. 59th over: Australia 152-6 (Cummins 29, Starc 3) Here comes Bumrah. Does he ever go away? He has Starc in his sights and the big man gets a single. Or is it two? NOOOOOO! There’s a huge mixup and Nitish has swooped and thrown it the ‘keeper. Rishabh Pant seizes the bouncing ball, removes the glove in a flash and throws down the the stumps at the non-striker’s end. This looks close… 58th over: Australia 152-6 (Cummins 29, Starc 3) Starc attacks! That was a full blooded drive and if Nitish Kumar Reddy hadn’t dived for the stop it was four. Instead it’s one run. Desperate hours here at the MCG. A Test, a series and cricket’s world heavyweight title in the balance. Cummins carves Siraj for another two runs from the last. 57th over: Australia 152-6 (Cummins 29, Starc 3) Cummins clips a single from Ravi Jadeja’s first ball. Australia lead by 257 now but runs are coming in a trickle. Do they risk being skittled cheaply by hitting out and trying and rip out India’s top order in the final hour? Or eke another 30 at snail’s pace so they’re safe at stumps? The question for Australia is: How much is enough? 56th over: Australia 150-6 (Cummins 28, Starc 2) Mohammed Siraj enjoyed that. He raises his arms and flapped them fiercely at the crowd, bellowing the whole time. Was that a sharp retort to the jerring Australian fans? Or a rev-up for the Indian contingent? Great theatre either way! New batter Starc flails one over the top to steal two runs. First ball is straight and fast from Siraj and Marnus misses. Big shout… OUT! Marnus reviews straight away but Siraj looks confident. Of course he does. Is there any bat? Replays show no and Marnus must go. Massive breakthrough for India! Siraj has three and Australia are back in strife. 55th over: Australia 148-6 (Labuschagne 70, Cummins 28) A tight leave first up by Cummins as Jadeja ramps the pace up to 95kph. It narrowly missed off stump so it’s a good leave. And there’s a good shot! Captain Pat swivels Jadeja fine for a boundary. That brings the partnership to 57 and Australia lead to 253. 54th over: Australia 144-6 (Labuschagne 70, Cummins 24) Attempted yorker. It’s straight and full but Labuschagne brings the bat down in time and jams it through backward square for two runs. He gets another two with a hip chip from the last. Hang on, it’s a belated no ball decision. 53rd over: Australia 139-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 24) Edged but safe! Cummins pierces slips and runs two. Weird few moments as the Australian pair knock back two singles from Jadeja. They need to win this Test to take the Sydney weather Gods out of the equation next week. Lose or draw and they’re behind the 8-ball. Finally Cummins taps another run to escape Cyclone Jasprit next over. 52nd over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) Squared up and beaten! What a seed! Off stump line and seaming away. Bowler and batter share a grin at that one. Bumrah walks back to his mark watching the big screen and marvelling at his own genius. He proves it three more times as Marnus is made to look increasingly mortal. If you’re wondering… England hold the record for the highest score chased at the MCG which was 332 back in December 1928. Not a bad target for Australia to aim for I reckon. 51st over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) Jadeja is whirling through his fifth over. He has 0-10 so far but has accelerated the run-rate no end. Cummins knocks back a single on the fifth to stay off strike to Mr Bumrah. Over to you Marnus… 50th over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) Bumrah’s spell begins with a maiden as Labuschagne signals Australia’s intent to shut up shop when he’s the maestro is on and have a lash at whoever’s at the other end. We’ll see how that works out… Tick, tick… Bumrah. He has the ball in hand and we are about to resume. What a session! Yet again Jasprit Bumrah tore apart Australia’s brittle batting to bring India back into the game that looked to be slipping away. Bumrah has 4-30 from 14 overs and the scalps of Travis Head (1), MItch Marsh (0) and Alex Carey (2) are hanging from his belt to join that of Sam Konstas (8) from the first session. In doing so Bumrah went to 202 Test wickets at an average of 20. Incredible! Even so, Australia fought their way back in that final hour. Marnus Labuschagne has scrapped and scraped his way to an undefeated 60 and Pat Cummins (21 not out) is playing another brilliant rearguard knock to save his top order’s blushes. Those two have put on 43 runs in quick time – by far Australia’s most profitable partnership. This will be a fascinating night session. Will Bumrah the Destroyer return and rip through Australia’s final four wickets. Or will this epic Test take another twist with Australia batting beyond 300 and giving India a challenging target on day five? Grab a cuppa and contemplate. We’ll be back with the final session shortly. 49th over: Australia 135-6 (Labuschagne 65, Cummins 21) At 43 runs, Cummins and Labuschagne have given Australia its best partnership of the innings. But it almost ends as Jaiswal DROPS ANOTHER! The young opener has been banished from slips after dropping two catches there and put in the dog box of silly mid-off. Now Cummins fends at Jadeja and spits a catch at ankle-height but airborne enough to get fingers to it. Alas, Jaiswal is too high in his crouch and another chance goes begging. That’s Tea. 48th over: Australia 134-6 (Labuschagne 64, Cummins 21) Two from the first as Sundar shucks the rust with a first ball down legside. Second is wide again but outside off and Labuschagne slaps at it but can’t pierce the field. he does better next time, chipping past silly mid-on for a run. Australia lead by 239 and this partnership is now worth 43 runs. 47th over: Australia 131-6 (Labuschagne 61, Cummins 21) Another Jadeja over goes by in fast-forward with just a Labuschagne single from it. Looks like Washinton Sundar will bowl the last over before tea. Curious and curiouser… 46th over: Australia 131-6 (Labuschagne 60, Cummins 21) Short and sweet from Akash and Labuschagne swings it to the rope for four. Next one angles back and Marnus chops down late and watches aghast as it fizzes back towards the stumps… but bounces over! The luck of Labuschagne strikes again. He takes a single to celebrate leabing Cummins to carve the final ball to the boundary backward of point. Shot, skipper! 45th over: Australia 121-6 (Labuschagne 54, Cummins 17) Time for spin. Ravi Jadeja returns to the attack and his first ball is wide and full. Labuschagne cuts for a run. Cummins watches the next three then steps out and drives for four. Australia’s captain is putting together another valuable innings for his side here. 44th over: Australia 117-6 (Labuschagne 54, Cummins 14) Dropped! Akash Deep threw it down short and Cummins gave it a heave and top-edged. Nitish Kumar Reddy sent off under swirling wind to claim the catch but couldn’t get there in time. Valiant attempt. Cummins nails the next one and it runs close to the rope for another two. 43rd over: Australia 111-6 (Labuschagne 52, Cummins 9) Marnus gets his fifty with a push to square leg. It’s been another rearguard action by the mercurial No 3 who has held this innings together while never quite getting ion top of India’s bowling attack. Now Cummins flashes at a full ball outside off by Siraj. They run three. Labuschagne drives past mid-on for another two then works a single off his hip. Siraj is starting to tire, he’s too weary even to mutter murderous intent at the batters. Seven from the over. Australia lead by 216 but they need another hundred to be safe and apply pressure. 42nd over: Australia 104-6 (Labuschagne 49, Cummins 6) Uh-oh, Bumrah is back! After a short spell in the skinny shadows of the Shane Warne Stand, India’s destroyer has been recalled by skipper Rohit Sharma for a final spell in the hot half hour before tea. Bumrah runs in with 4-28 and you wouldn’t bet against him scalping the final four. Cummins fends off the first and Labuschagne rebuffs a single to fine leg to retain strike. Can Australia survive? Marnus finds a single from the last to keep strike for the next. 41st over: Australia 102-6 (Labuschagne 47, Cummins 5) With the zinc beading under his crazy eyes, Mohammed Siraj charges in at Cummins who flails at the first and edges the second, but survives both. He finds relief in a single to mid-on. Labuschagne, who is closing on another fighting half century despite living dangerously all innings, sees off the rest. 40th over: Australia 100-6 (Labuschagne 47, Cummins 4) Thick edge from Labuschagne and Jaiswal DROPS IT AGAIN! Good grief. A bad shot from Marnus – a half-blooded catching practice cut straight to the fielders – but an even worse attempt by the youngster, who reached with hard hands and put it down cold. That’s the second one Jaiswal has shelled at slip today after giving Usman Khawaja another life this morming. Is it the stroke of luck Australia need? 39th over: Australia 99-6 (Labuschagne 46, Cummins 4) Captain Pat responds! First ball he faces from Siraj and Cummins clubs it into the outfield for four – all run. A statement shot. He will attack India with the bat and then go after them with the ball. Unnerved, Siraj sends the next few wide. Fourth Test on a tightrope right now. 38th over: Australia 94-6 (Labuschagne 46, Cummins 0) Another one for Bumrah, but he’s bowling to Labuschagne, which is not what India want. In fact Labuschagne turns down a single first ball! Into the leg side, no thanks. Farming the strike with your No8 who nearly made a half century in the first innings. That’s the respect they have for this bowling artist. Labuschagne leaves where he can, gets through the over, then tries to dab four with a late cut from the last ball, but misses. And that, with a large exhale, is me for the day. Angus will be with you for the next four Bumrah wickets. 37th over: Australia 94-6 (Labuschagne 46, Cummins 0) Siraj to Labuschagne, a couple of runs to cover. Andrew Jagels wrote in with a question earlier, before the action cranked up, so I will attempt an answer given it might be of interest to others. “Could any of our Indian readers clarify why some players have their first names on their shirts (Jasprit, Virat) whereas others have their ‘surname’ (Rahul, Siraj). The variety has always puzzled me.” I’ve had other correspondence asking this, so I’ll attempt the short version, based on working in cricket. Forgive any generalisations or errors. Basically, first name and surname structure doesn’t apply elsewhere in a Western way, unsurprisingly. India has so many different cultural and language groups that there are lots of methods of structuring names. Tamils tend to use their father’s name and then their own name, so Ravichandran Ashwin’s name is Ashwin. He wouldn’t use Ravichandran on a shirt, because it’s not his name. So his shirt name is also his personal name. But then Tamils who move elsewhere sometimes flip the order, so Washington Sundar’s name is Washington and his father is Sundar. Or our colleague Bharat Sundaresan’s name is Bharat, his dad was Sundaresan. Other cultural groups might use a common grouping name, like Singh or Sharma or Reddy, which are not really surnames but identifying broader group membership. So some coverage calls yesterday’s century-maker Nitish Kumar rather than Reddy. We went with Reddy because it’s not that common as a cricketing name, though it’s very common where he’s from. For another example, Jadeja’s first name in full is Ravindrasingh, but the ‘singh’ part gets discarded in the same way that the Kumar part after Nitish might eventually be. Then someone like Kohli, who does have a first name and surname structure, it’s more about marketing than naming. Having the Virat 18 shirt is a brand thing, and helps sell millions of copies, as well as promoting the brand he uses in other commercial ventures. The player agents probably decide that, it’s personal choice. Devdutt Padikkal was just out there sub fielding wearing a shirt that only said “Dev”. So that probably doesn’t answer your question, exactly, because there isn’t one answer, but that fact is also the answer. There are lots of different ways to structure Indian names, that are well beyond what we do with Smiths. 36th over: Australia 91-6 (Labuschagne 43) At a loss for words. Typed or written. Cummins will be in next. He’s done it again! Done it again, this time to a left-hander. Bumrah is unstoppable right now. It’s another snorter of a delivery. Around the wicket, angled in, then decking hard. Perfect length. Carey coming forward, trying to defend down the line. Not as extravagant an amount of movement as the Konstas one, but enough to beat the bat, perhaps brush the back pad, and nail the stumps. Bumrah has 29 for the series, 4 for 28 today. Can he keep it going? 35th over: Australia 88-5 (Labuschagne 40, Carey 2) Soooo. Labuschagne is looking good, and Carey has been in great touch. Australia still probably need another hundred runs though. Can’t expect the tail to deliver all the time. This is getting tight! Carey gets going with a flick through the leg side for two. Australia lead by 193. 34th over: Australia 85-5 (Labuschagne 38) Second ball and sixth ball of the over, those wickets. Bumrah has 201 at 19.46 right now, and in this series that’s 28 at 12.6. The series record for a visiting player is 38, by Maurice Tate. So a few more here and a big match in Sydney, who knows. They’re in it! India right in it now! Bumrah had just notched 200 career wickets at 19.56, the first player to cross that milestone averaging under 20. And he celebrates with 201. Two in the over. Marsh in a rut that he can’t get out of. Might not make it to Sydney. Australia 190 ahead, the wicketkeeper Carey coming out to join Labuschagne. Into the basket! Down comes the guillotine! Bumrah does it. He’s bowled so many great balls today that haven’t taken wickets, he deserves an innocuous one that does. In at the pads, Head flicks it away, but in the air and straight to short midwicket, where NK Reddy is hopping in the air and making it tough for himself but clings on to a ball around his midriff. 33rd over: Australia 84-3 (Labuschagne 38, Head 1) Off the mark first ball for Head, poked behind point, then Labuschagne guides a ball for three. He’s loving his threes today. India were bubbling about the place with the Smith wicket, they think they’re still in it. Got to lop off Head though, he could cost them the match in an hour. There’s that late-game probability! Not a good ball from Siraj, full and wide and there to hit if a player wants to. Smith does, huge drive, no footwork, reaching, and nicks it. 32nd over: Australia 80-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 13) Time to try the man of the moment. Nitish Kumar Reddy bowls an innocuous first over, with a couple of twos in there for Marnus. 31st over: Australia 76-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 13) Carved away by Smith! Through the covers off Siraj, who has 1 for 16 and has just gone for his first boundary of the innings. 30th over: Australia 70-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 8) An awkward pull from Smith misses, a cover drive connects for three. Akash Deep goes past Labuschagne’s edge for the umpteenth time. How have they not got more edges here? 29th over: Australia 64-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 5) A few run-out jitters, as Labuschagne sends back Smith. But Smith goes back, and plays out the rest of the Bumrah over, wandering across towards the off side to block, taking a single last ball. 28th over: Australia 63-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 4) Snorter from Akash Deep. That ball goes up the trellis, past the glovery of Labuschagne and smacks the palms of Pant standing back, taken up around his shoulders. Then another, two balls later, and this one does crush his gloves. Hand off the bat, and he’s got the physio out there. If the bounce is doing this already, no way India are chasing a big score. Labuschagne gets some strapping on his forearm, like Konstas. It’s a big day for forearm injuries. Jeremy Stokes on the email: “Interesting re. Icelandic cricket term ‘the cat is back in the sack’. The Russian phrase ‘a cat in a sack’ loosely means not knowing whether what you’re going to get is going to be good or bad. Eg. ‘Sam Konstas is coming out to bat - this is a cat in a sack’.” Huh. Schrodinger’s cat in a sack? Where the unknown is less the aliveness and more the quality? Personally I would go for ‘Rasputin in a rug.’ Again, no idea whether he’s dead or alive in there. 27th over: Australia 63-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 4) What is Rohit Sharma’s favourite thing about lunch? He can ask Bumrah to bowl again afterwards. Begging for more magic. Bumrah must be tired, not so much physically but from the demand of needing to be the main player time and again. He bowls a few decent balls without the earlier menace, then overpitches and meets a lovely straight drive from Labuschagne. Top class, back past the bowler for four. 26th over: Australia 58-2 (Labuschagne 23, Smith 4) Lunch done, Akash Deep to start us off, but he gets too straight and he’s bowling to the Flick Brothers. Thee for Labushagne, two for Smith, all off the pads. Peter Leybourne, who is reading the OBO in bed in Bangkok and using the lunch break to make his breakfast, has sent me a glossary of Icelandic cricket terms. Personal faves, the wicketkeeper translates to ‘the keeper of the gate’, via the word vikketwörður. A duck is a duck but a golden duck is a falcon. Or if you say that someone is back in the hutch, you say “the cat is back in the sack”. I’m very interested in late-game-Smith, any time Steve Smith bats on day four or five. Because he’s rarely been effective late in games. You heard about his 34th Test hundred in this match – 30 of those have come in his team’s first innings. Only four batting second. Of those, all four were in the third match innings. Never made a ton in the fourth. Those third-innings hundreds, by the way: Edgbaston, his only twin tons, on his astonishing return in 2019. New Zealand at the WACA, on a pitch so flat that Mitchell Johnson spontaneously retired halfway through the Test. Melbourne 2017, when the surface was so turgid that they dug up and replaced the entire square. And Pune in 2017, when the game moved so quickly that he was batting a second time by day two. This isn’t a criticism per se, it’s just intriguing that a player can be such a dominant force in some ways and not a factor in others. Fun session. Some fine fast bowling, it was exciting moment by moment for a good while there. A few good shots, a couple of memorable deliveries, Jasprit Bumrah getting fired up on dismissing Sam Konstas and copying the young player’s move of waving to the crowd to get up adn about. Pretty good attendance by the looks, bottoms bays of the Olympic and Southern Stands filled out through the session. Nice sunshine out there and moderate temperatures. Australia in much the stronger position, there’s a big modern trend of overestimating how many runs one needs to defend in a fourth innings, but India remain in the game if they can get a rush of wickets happening. 25th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 20, Smith 2) Who said that Rohit Sharma is out of captaincy ideas? An over of spin before lunch! It’s bold, it’s daring, it’s a revelation. This is the incisive thinking we’ve been waiting for. Jadeja is the dart artist of choice, left arm straight, and he’s immediately clipped for three by Labuschagne. Smith tries a back-foot punch through cover but finds the fielder. And that’s it. It. Is. Sandwich. Time. 24th over: Australia 50-2 (Labuschagne 17, Smith 2) Labuschagne squeezes a single down to fine leg from Deep, second last over before the interval. Gets Smith onto strike, and gets Smith off the mark, a bottom handed wipe of a shot through midwicket. Like a mafia henchman, ugly but effective. 23rd over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Another scoreless over blocked out by Smith from Siraj, very happy to play for lunch at this stage. 22nd over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Akash Deep back for Bumrah, who did look like he was flagging in that previous over. And dishes out a working over! Smashes Labuschagne in the box, which is the trend of the moment, the mode du jour. Beats the inside half of the bat a couple more times, hitting pads, appealing. Loves an appeal for a very not out lbw, does our guy. No run. 21st over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Siraj to Smith, playing at almost everything, but taking his time to get a read of the pitch. 20th over: Australia 47-2 (Labuschagne 16, Smith 0) Bumrah with a normal human over, one that Labuschagne is able to defend without any personal injury or bowel-outraging alarms, before driving four through cover. 19th over: Australia 43-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 0) It was a great setup, if it was one. Four balls all going across, but pitching in line with the stumps first. The wicket ball also pitches in line, but just in line with leg stump, a touch straighter. And a couple of feet fuller, making sure the length is right. India need Siraj, who was so good on their last tour. He’s contributed today. Smith blocks his first ball. Another one clean bowled! Through the gate goes Siraj, lots of effort in the delivery action, and was there a little swing in there? Or was that seam? Siraj has been going past the outside edge time and again, now he passes the inside edge through a big gap and takes out middle and off stump. 18th over: Australia 43-1 (Khawaja 21, Labuschagne 12) Bumrah to Khawaja, who edges a run behind point, allowing the bowler to smack Labuschagne’s pads with an in-ducker and go to DRS when Umpire Gough says no. I thought leg side, live. It’s umpire’s call, and the tracking says possibly brushing the corner of the leg bail, so fair to err towards the batter. But a different call on field and they would have had him. Labuschagne adds another two off his pads to end the over. Eamonn Maloney has been studying the Wiki. “Unique but possibly not quite complimentary enough to be autobiography? Unlike the highly suspect page of an ex-AFL player I came across once that described him as ‘a successful businessman in today’s society’.” In today’s society! That sounds like a high-school debate opening. 17th over: Australia 40-1 (Khawaja 20, Labuschagne 10) Siraj isn’t bowling as short as Deep, but he keeps beating the edge too. Bowling across Khawaja, who makes it through another over and adds a run. 16th over: Australia 39-1 (Khawaja 19, Labuschagne 10) Five overs up front, now a chance of ends to bowl his sixth replacing Akash Deep. Bumrah starts with another leaping ball that smacks into Pant’s gloves after a fruitless push, but Labuschagne gets two next ball with a modest drive past the bowler. Beaten by the third ball of the over, very close to the edge and just over the bails as well, Pant appealing out of a sense that somehow, if the arc of the universe bends towards justice, that just should be out, even though the bat didn’t touch it. A hefty lbw appeal next ball, but Bumrah’s inward movement is taking it well down the leg side. Too good for thee, but too good for himself as well. Fifth ball, back past the outside edge, as the cordon hops and bubbles like the cheese on a French onion soup. Then Labuschagne ends the over with a bit of soup in his cup, as Bumrah cuts one into him and liquefies his box. Ouch. What an over. What a bowler. We keep saying things like this, but he is honestly on a level all his own right at the moment. 15th over: Australia 37-1 (Khawaja 19, Labuschagne 8) Much better over from Siraj. He draws an edge from Labuschagne that bounces in front of Kohli at slip and skims through his hands. Then a couple of really nice balls to the left-hander that threaten the edge. Now Bumrah is coming back. 14th over: Australia 36-1 (Khawaja 19, Labuschagne 7) Good pull shot from Khawaja. One of his main strokes when he’s playing well. Deep bowls a seventh over on the trot. Andy Bradshaw asks if it counts as a slogging injury “when the much missed Andrew Symonds ripped the bicep off the bone smacking Sajid Mahmood into orbit during the 2007 VB series, because Paul Nixon had irritated him so much?” We’ve developed a theory on The Final Word pod that Paul Nixon may have written his own Wikipedia page, given the level of detail and the fulsomeness of description compared to pages of some rather more prominent players. Go and have a look and tell me what you think. And donate to them. And donate to the Guardian, so I don’t get in trouble for saying that. 13th over: Australia 32-1 (Khawaja 15, Labuschagne 7) There we go. Siraj time, and the batting gets easy. Fish are jumping and the cotton is high. Three for Labuschagne, turned through square leg, three for Khawaja through point, two more for Marnus on the glance. The age of ease. Drinks. 12th over: Australia 24-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 2) Sixth over for Akash Deep, only a glanced single from it, he’s only gone for 13 in total. But we need that other column populated, Akash, to keep this game bubbling. 11th over: Australia 23-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 1) Bumrah gets a break. Amazing first spell, but I still think that Australia have had the better of it. India really needed Bumrah to get on a tear, get them three down perhaps. Could easily have happened, but another ten overs of graft and then the Australians can start to regain control of the innings. No run for Khawaja from Siraj’s first over. “‘You come for the King, you best not miss,’ spake Bumrah to Konstas.” That’s from Samir Chopra, quoting Omar Little. Konstas couldn’t do anything but miss that ball. 10th over: Australia 23-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 1) You’re hearing it more and more: Akash Deep, please pitch it up a little. Just a little. Deep is too shallow. He’s getting plenty out of this surface, exciting movement, but he’s kept passing the edge. Until he gets a nick! That is a bit fuller, but Labuschagne edges it into his leg first, and that takes the pace off it. Lands in front of slip. 9th over: Australia 23-1 (Khawaja 12, Labuschagne 1) How the hell is Khawaja still there? Two more in this over from Bumrah that go careening past the edge, as the batter tries to drive rather than just being a static target. It doesn’t work. 8th over: Australia 21-1 (Khawaja 11, Labuschagne 0) Right India, it’s time for Somebody Else As Well As Bumrah. Time for whoever that player is to do something with the ball. This is a good over from Deep, keeps Khawaja pinned down around the off stump, but can’t dislodge him. 7th over: Australia 20-1 (Khawaja 10, Labuschagne 0) Welcome to the jungle, Marnus. Labuschagne walks out and immediately gets beaten by another Bumrah jagger. Timmmmbbbberrrrr! What a ball from Bumrah! The da Vinci of hyperextension, except that Bumrah actually finishes his projects. That is unbelievable, in the literal sense. How do you play that? You don’t. You can’t. We can’t answer the question of whether Konstas can bat, because that wasn’t batting. He was just standing in the way. This ball pitches outside the off stump by a good distance, then seams as wickedly as the ones away from Khawaja earlier. But it’s seaming into the right hander. Screaming in. He plays the right line, for a ball that was moving anywhere near a normal amount. This one though goes past his inside edge. From well outside off, it knocks leg stump out of the ground. What a moment. 6th over: Australia 20-0 (Konstas 8, Khawaja 10) “I love the fact that after the last four days of Konstas mania, we still have no idea if he can bat.” Quite so, Peter Salmon. Might answer that before lunch. Konstas misses the first ball here, huge appeal from Deep. Senselessly, because that ball hits the top of the thigh. Nice movement, but pitch it up a bit, buddy. Nope, Deep goes shorter and Konstas pulls four through fine leg off a top edge, then nicks on the bounce past Jaiswal at gully for one. They’ve got deep third back for the scoop. Still no closer to an answer. 5th over: Australia 15-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 10) A delay while Konstas gets some strapping on his forearm and takes a couple of painkillers. Not sure what happened there. He hasn’t been hit, as far as I can see. Called for the physio immediately after the catch fell short. Can you strain a forearm muscle from slogging too hard? Bumrah keeps working over Khawaja. I don’t know how he hasn’t nicked one of these first three deliveries. They’ve all done too much, in the end. The third one is fuller than the others, and still deviates so far it misses willow. Last ball of the over, though, Khawaja can glance for four. 4th over: Australia 11-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 6) Still unconvincing, Khawaja. Misses a pull shot, edges to gully on the bounce, before flicking two runs square. Deep is bowling from the Shane Warne Stand end of the ground, the old Southern Stand. Khawaja drops a single. Konstas edged in front of gully. Jaiswal again. A very low ball, that one, but he hesitates and hangs back for half a second. Perhaps if he’d gone forward immediately he might have got fingers under it, but would have been tough. “Liked your piece on Reddy.” Cheers, Colum Fordham. “Together with Australia’s Sam Konstas, he has added a breath of fresh air to test cricket. All raw talent and nerveless aggression. Shame in a way that he capitulated early to Lyon but still. India have a faint whiff of a chance to draw the match if they dig in but it won’t be plain sailing. At least Reddy’s wonderful innings has given India some hope. Will be fascinating to see Konstas’ reaction now. I’m sure there will be fireworks one way or another.” 3rd over: Australia 8-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 3) Bumrah’s turn to beat Khawaja outside the off stump, but again there’s no edge. Indian bowlers need one early. If Australia pass 200 in this innings then the game is all but gone. Good ball from Bumrah! Rearing at Khawaja, just past the shoulder of the bat as he pulls the bat inside the line. Khawaja chats to himself about it as he walks away. Then he’s dropped! Oh, that was straight to him. Jaiswal at a leg gully, almost, had to be expecting a catch in that position. Glanced off the pads, low and fast and flat, but straight into the hands at about knee level, and Jaiswal just lets it burst through. Huge moment. 2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Konstas 3, Khawaja 2) Akash Deep with the new ball, not Siraj. If there’s any swing, now is the time. He has Khawaja hopping as ever, trying to play balls on a length. Gets one to fine leg. Deep bowls a goody to Konstas, that slams the seam and decks away, just past the edge. Then outswing but Konstas carves with the movement to deep backward for two, before being beaten again by a ball too short to take his edge. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Konstas 1, Khawaja 1) The Double Ks come to the middle, Konstas on strike to Bumrah… and there are boos as he takes a single first ball! Little pull shot. Khawaja glances his first run. Bumrah not quite on the spot yet, sore shoulders from carrying the side, all that. Bowls wide of the off stump and has a word to himself as Konstas stares back at him, then bowls leg stump and deflects off the pads for two. Pace down in the low 130s. Let’s give him an over or two to warm up. There’s the first Konstas shot! Charges, swats, misses with an almost horizontal bat, and the ball bounces over his stumps. John Starbuck, our most maritime-coded correspondent, writes in. “‘Morning, Geoff. Oh how I miss Richie saying ‘Morning everyone’. I’m currently drinking golden rum to help me sleep later (he says) and carrying on with re-reading Jasper Fforde’s The Woman Who Died a Lot, which I recommend, even though the dominant sport is not cricket, but croquet. More power to your typing fingers as I’m set to enjoy the OBO, so long as the rain holds off. What’s the weather forecast for the MCG?” I once confused some very pleasant Icelanders who thought I was talking about croquet. Weather is set fair, cool on the walk in this morning, but on the way to the mid 20s and no rain for the rest of the Test. So the Indian pair added 11 this morning, trimming the deficit usefully. Now everything rides on their efforts with the ball. Will Australia fall victim to the third-innings wobble, as they did in Brisbane? Will they seize control of this match? Sam Konstas is going to bat in a few minutes. Strap in, either way. Never mind, the point of contention is soon resolved. Team play from Reddy, he could have just batted for the nice red ink ton, but he keeps taking on Lyon and hits him down the ground again. This time elevated but not enough distance, and Starc at long off has the buckets out. Lyon gets three instead of Cummins getting four. 119th over: India 369-9 (Reddy 114, Siraj 4) Cheers as Siraj blocks the first ball. Not many in yet this morning with the early start, though the MCC area is well stocked. Siraj is able to squirt away a run fourth ball, then Reddy adds another. Then a big to-do from the last ball. Siraj jams down on a yorker outside off stump. It squeezes up from the edge to slip. Umpire’s review checks the bump ball, and the Bangladeshi third umpire Sharfuddoula rules it not out! Cummins is astonished, the Australians had already started wandering towards the fence when they saw the replay. Cummins is making the T sign for a review to the standing umpires, over and over again, while Joel Wilson tells him that he can’t review a review. I have to agree with Cummins there. There’s a chance that the ball is touching bat and ground at the same time as it arrives, I guess. That might be the umpire’s thinking. But it comes up off the ground and then subsequently off the bat, I would say. Touches the bat last on its way to slip. Anyway. Not out. 118th over: India 367-9 (Reddy 113, Siraj 3) Single first ball! Happy to let Siraj face the spin of Lyon. Interesting. Siraj might need to look for a run here rather than block out five balls. And he does so! A little prod behind point, nicely done. Reddy sweeps a couple of runs square. Then charges Lyon and smites four! That’s the stuff. When you may not have many opportunities to face, got to take the ones you get, and the young century-maker has been happy taking on Lyon all series. Down the ground this time. But can’t find the run from the sixth ball to keep strike. Cummins with a full over to Siraj could be the codicil. 117th over: India 359-9 (Reddy 106, Siraj 2) Cummins to bowl, Reddy to resume on a century, the onlookers cheer… and he plays a forward defence. Nice. Blocks out a couple and then decides to take the single fourth ball of the over, not fifth or sixth. So he’s decided to trust Siraj from the outset. Not so much that they take a possible run when Siraj blocks a ball into the midwicket gap. He spars at the sixth, down the line of the stumps, and it goes by the edge. Players are coming onto the field. Some Indian squad members are still taking high catches as the umpires walk out. That’s dedication. Now they’re on the move. Drop me an email, the address is in the sidebar. Or the bit up the top on your phone. The special part of yesterday was Reddy’s innings, one that he couldn’t have assembled without the partnership support from Washington Sundar. So that’s what I wrote about at stumps. Day 4, and the match is still is alive. I love that for us. December 28th may be known forevermore as Nitish Kumar Reddy Day. That’s unlikely, but it wouldn’t be outrageous if it happened. It was one hell of an innings from the young player to assemble his first century in Tests and to do so from No 8 in the order. India still trail by a lot, 116 runs, but they have a path towards at least scrapping this out for a draw, or if they happen to bowl well in the third innings then they could be in the frame for a win. So the scores are: Australia 474, India 358-9. Of course, the advantage is still very much with Australia, and all they have to do is bat decently in the third innings to put a win out of reach for India, and shoot for one themselves. First, though, they need to finish off Reddy. He reached 105 not out by the time bad light and rain ended play early on Day 3. He’s still there, and he’ll have strike. But he only has Mohammed Siraj for company. So this could all be over in a couple of minutes, or he might farm the strike for a while and whittle down that deficit still further. Let’s see."
"Four months after Paris 2024’s spectacular finale, starring Tom Cruise abseiling off the top of the Stade de France and hurtling out of a plane above Los Angeles, the executive director of the Olympics is mulling over the lasting impact of the Games. Albeit with the help of a rather different cinematic icon. “I was making a presentation to Deloitte executives recently,” says Christophe Dubi, the man responsible for planning and delivering the Olympics. “And I started by paraphrasing the Stranger in The Big Lebowski: ‘Sometimes, there is a man, he’s the man for his time and place, he was The Dude.’ Because Paris really was the right Games, at the right time and place.” Warming to his theme, he says: “There were a lot of geopolitical tensions, with people upset about just about everything every day. And suddenly you have this breath of fresh air, unfolding under our eyes, at a moment where it was needed.” At the Paris 2024 headquarters, meanwhile, its chief executive, Étienne Thobois, offers his own succinct summary of those 17 days of joyous madness. “You always hope,” he says. “But you don’t really believe it until you see it. It was intense, exciting and, well, fabulous.” Few in the French capital would demur. Every day brought fresh heroes and dramatic new storylines; unexpected memes and memories. To British ears the names Keely Hodgkinson, Alex Yee and Tom Pidcock are enough to slip the mind back in time. Léon Marchand, Sydney McLaughlin‑Levrone and Yuto Horigome went global, while Raygun, the pose of the Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec and the Rubik’s cube gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik went viral. After the corruption-soaked Rio Olympics, and the Ghost Games of Tokyo, Paris felt like a much-needed return to form and relevance. Especially in the moment. But how does it look in retrospect – especially now the data has been crunched and marinated? The numbers are encouraging. This month the International Olympic Committee published independent research claiming that 84% of the total potential global audience, equal to around 5 billion people, followed Paris 2024. It also found that each viewer watched about nine hours of coverage, on average, a 25% rise compared to Tokyo. Meanwhile 73% of people felt the Games were a success – compared to 65% for Tokyo and 57% for Rio. But what gives Dubi particular satisfaction is that attention among gen Z viewers is trending particularly well. “We have regained what we had somewhat lost,” he insists. “So when you reconquer gen Z, those that are looking at the world facing the future rather than looking at the past, it really matters.” Meanwhile for Thobois the overriding satisfaction is how much the original Paris 2024 playbook – including the opening ceremony on the Seine, the marathon for all, allowing 20,024 runners on the official course, and the concept of Games Wide Open, using Paris’s iconic landmarks as venues – was delivered and embraced. “There are two things that I think made it a success,” he says. “First, if you look at the bid book and all its innovation, and what we delivered, we were quite close. We had a clear vision, an ambition, and we carried it off pretty well. And second, we delivered a Games that embraced and mixed Olympic and French values.” He cites the Olympic cauldron rising up off the Seine every night as a particularly vivid memory. “It was almost a spiritual moment every night with up to 40,000 people watching this thing in silence. It was the City of Light under the Olympic light. It was almost poetic, and I think very French.” And then there were the crowds, particularly in the road bike races on Montmartre and during the triathlon. “They were everywhere. And the magic of the Games was just fantastic.” Of course there were issues. Days before the Olympics, the Paris 2024 systems were affected by the CrowdStrike outage. There was anger about the lack of protein for athletes in the village. The French train network was hit by arson attacks on the day of the opening ceremony. And then, hours later, came the deluge as biblical levels of rain hit Paris when the world’s eyes were on it. “The thing is, when you look at the statistics it cannot happen,” Dubi says. “Yes, you can have a light shower maybe. But what happened that night? Statistically, it happens maybe once in a century. But I knew that for every section of the opening ceremony, we had a plan B that would unfold and we would deliver it so I wasn’t worried about the rain.” However, Dubi was concerned how the athletes, major stars, chief executives and spectators were feeling under their ponchos. “But no one complained. Out of resilience, something magical was formed.” We might forget now that the threat of terrorism was such that 45,000 police and security forces were on guard that night. Or that there were widespread fears beforehand of terrorism attacks, strikes or delays getting into stadiums. However, Dubi concedes the Olympic movement does need to absorb some lessons. Asked about the controversies in Paris, especially the Dutch beach volleyball rapist being allowed to play, and Imane Khelif and Lin Yu‑ting competing in the women’s boxing tournament, he replies: “There are some moments where things happen, and you move on. And then there are the issues that you raise here. “There were others – such as the 60-second rule to appeal in gymnastics – which has retained our attention as well. And there, you have to take a step back and say: ‘Yes, that’s an issue to be addressed.’” And what of the legacy? Thobois cites the cleaning of the Seine as a major plus, along with providing more sports equipment and facilities, especially in Saint-Denis. And he is still confident there will be “intangible” legacies too from the Games, such as the benefits from schools having 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Of course, those heady days where Paris seemed to enjoy a three-week party are long gone. Real life, and political strife, once again dominate the landscape. But Dubi insists that what happened in the summer still resonates. And not only in the French capital. “The uniqueness of the Games – and what Olympic values mean for society – is probably more relevant than ever,” he says. “And Paris has reinforced that uniqueness.”"
"It has been a tour of polygraphic variation for India’s Test team. Down and out to begin in Perth, becoming ascendant by the end. Back to the bottom in Adelaide, dragging themselves out of trouble in Brisbane to finish the draw there on a high. But starting the fourth Test in Melbourne, right in the series at 1-1, was the first time the Indians have looked completely at a loss. It’s not that nobody has ever batted aggressively in Tests. Gilbert Jessop, David Hookes, Sanath Jayasuriya, Rishabh Pant, most of England’s current lineup – plenty have had their shot. It’s not that nobody has played a scoop shot to Jasprit Bumrah in a Test – ask Joe Root, who soon found it didn’t work out so well. What is unique with Sam Konstas is a combination of factors: to be on debut, in front of a full MCG, facing a world-leading fast bowler whose series so far reads 21 wickets at 10, while at an age two years short of being able to buy a whiskey sour in Kentucky, and still having the stones to play that shot from the 11th ball of your Test career. Then when it fails, play it again. And when that fails, again. And again. And again, as it begins to succeed. Perhaps that is the genius in picking a 19-year-old: less about courage, more about that spongy pre-frontal cortex, home to an as‑yet undeveloped sense of risk. Perhaps only a teenager would be game to take on that situation. Perhaps only a teenager would be forgiven if it had failed. Or perhaps the tactic made sense. Bumrah started the day with as good a first over as you’ll see. At pace, the ball moving outrageously off the seam to beat Konstas on the outside edge: once, twice, thrice, whatever the word is for four times. So Konstas might have reasoned that he could keep poking around like Nathan McSweeney and wait to suffer the same fate, or he could try the opposite and see if the sisters of myth had something else in mind for him. Meanwhile, somewhere in the Big Bash lumping runs from fluorescent adversaries, McSweeney might right now be wondering if he should have tried the same thing. It was never perfect, but that’s what drove India mad. Had somebody flawlessly timed those shots, they would have had to doff a cap. But the first attempt saw a ball clear the off bail. The second was too wide for the shot. The third made contact but wasn’t clean, a miscue trickled to the rope. The fourth and fifth took recalibration halfway down. Konstas guessed that Bumrah would target the stumps, and was ready, but had to adjust to the line, shifting his target region from fine leg to deep third by moving his wrists to swap the scoop into reverse. Both were perilous. So all of those moments frustrated India. Bumrah started with a smile that said he had Konstas’s measure, and ended with a smile that said he wasn’t sure what more he could do. Others were less sanguine, Mohammed Siraj getting verbal after Konstas charged him and hit a ball back that struck the bowler. While fielding that ball next to Konstas, Virat Kohli gave him a stern glare that was ignored. At the end of the over, Kohli walked the length of the pitch directly at Konstas and made forceful contact shoulder to shoulder, a collision that will be examined endlessly by a million self-appointed advocates. It seemed like it was not just audacity bothering the Indian players, but the fact that Konstas had got away with it, offending some sense of justice in the way that cricket’s luck is meted out. A few risky shots is one thing, 50 at a run a ball something else. By the time he was out lbw to spin, Konstas had singlehandedly lifted Bumrah’s tour average from 10.9 to 12.71. He had derailed the quick’s opening spell and India’s concentration. In the session and a half that followed, India conceded half-centuries to each of Australia’s top four. Of course, Bumrah being Bumrah, he later had a couple of spells yielding two wickets for 10, and India got Australia six down late in the day. But by then the horse had not only bolted, it had founded an underground resistance movement to come back for the rest of the herd. A score north of 300 on this Melbourne pitch already has Australia right on top, with Smith to resume on 68 and Australia’s capable lower order for company. Inevitably, Marnus Labuschagne, out for 72, will be chastised for another unconverted fifty. Konstas with 60 will be praised for setting the tone, taking the initiative. It won’t always be this easy: as his career continues he will get little patience when busts intersperse the booms. See English infuriation with the similarly built Zak Crawley. But then, Konstas probably won’t always play this way. It was a specific approach for a specific day. That day happens to be his first, and people remember debuts. So it’s a day that he will always have: at 10am, learning with the toss that he was about to bat. At 10.28am, racing to the middle ahead of Khawaja to examine the pitch. And well before lunch, done for the day, but already snapping selfies in the crowd, having become for the moment a new national cricket hero. The moment might not last, but right now it belongs to Sam Konstas."
"We are knee-deep in Twixmas: that twilight zone between Christmas and new year, excess and reflection, lists and yet more lists. Over the past week there have been many saluting the best sporting moments of 2024. Yet across the globe there is one constant: these lists are dominated by a Paris Olympics seared into the memory. Nothing else came close. Pick your day, relive the moment. Keely Hodgkinson, Alex Yee, Simone Biles, Léon Marchand, Mondo Duplantis, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and a men’s 1500m final for the ages; I was fortunate to see them all up close. But even that list still barely scratches the surface. As Christophe Dubi, the executive director of the Olympics, put it to me recently, Paris 2024 was like the Dude in the Big Lebowski: the right Games at the right time and place. In fact it was so good, it even provided the most thrilling moments of the year in tennis and basketball – two sports where the Olympics are usually an afterthought not the pinnacle. Novak Djokovic’s victory over Carlos Alcaraz was one of the great men’s matches, while Steph Curry’s “golden dagger” provided one of the great moments, and memes, in the dying embers of Team USA’s triumph against France. The TV figures were also strong, with the BBC’s live coverage winning the ratings battle every day. So during this period of excess and reflection, a provocative question comes to mind. Would it be that wrong to stage the summer Games, this wondrous celebration of sport, more frequently? Perhaps, even, every two years? In the past you could have brusquely dismissed the idea with two words: too expensive. But Paris – while not exactly cheap – showed how to stage a Games without a city becoming a building site or being crippled with debt. The iconic tourist attractions provided the perfect backdrop. And only two new venues, the Olympic village and the diving centre, were built from scratch. It’s not as if there’s a shortage of potential hosts either. India and Hungary openly want an Olympics. Qatar and Saudi Arabia would be in like a shot as well. And so would London if it had a realistic chance to stage it again. Naturally, there are counterarguments, with the most compelling being that the Olympics would lose the rarity value that makes them so unique. And, as Michael Payne, a former senior marketing executive at the International Olympic Committee, explains, you can have too much of a good thing. “When Fifa was considering staging the World Cup every two years, they came out with various research studies saying that the fans wanted it,” he says. “But if you asked six-year-olds if they would like Christmas every day, what would the answer be? And how quickly would you end up destroying what makes it special?” Payne believes that Paris was arguably the greatest Olympics yet and provided a much‑needed reboot for the Olympic brand after Tokyo and Rio. But he warns that you can’t expect an organising committee to hit the heights of Paris – or London in 2012 – every time. He also wonders whether there is enough sponsor and TV money to support having a Games every two years. “The Olympic product is in robust health,” he insists. “But at the same time the business model, which has supported the Olympic world for 40 years, is undergoing significant change.” Not only is there growing uncertainty over the long‑term viability of the Olympic Partner sponsorship model, which brings hundreds of millions of pounds to the IOC every cycle, but many major TV contracts are due to run out in 2032. “I don’t think there’s anybody on the planet who can tell you what the landscape will look like in 2036,” Payne says. “Will it be the traditional players? Will it be new players? Might it even be people that we haven’t heard of today?” All that is true. But there is a final argument in favour of a more frequent Olympics. If the Games don’t push on, they may fall back. We live in an era where the average sports fan in the UK is increasingly a big-eventer. Sure, they will follow every cough and spit of the football season. But in an average calendar year, their focus is on the big events in the biggest sports. For tennis and golf that means the grand slams and majors. For rugby it is the Six Nations and World Cup. Cricket? Probably Test series against Australia and India, the World Cups and not much else. And for the classic Olympic sports and athletes? Let’s be honest. Outside of perhaps track and field, how many will enter the public’s consciousness even once before Los Angeles in 2028? The danger is that in a world of shortening attention spans, out of sight may lead to being permanently out of mind. Sure, there are logistical challenges in staging an Olympics every two or perhaps three years. But they are not insurmountable. To avoid the football World Cup, for instance, the Olympics could be staged in odd years. One last point. We often hear from the IOC that the athletes are at the heart of the Olympics. But how can it be right that many of the greatest athletes of this or any era – from Biles to Duplantis to McLaughlin-Levrone – will have to wait four years to have the world’s attention fully focused on them again?

"Joe Root has been recalled to the England ODI side for the first time since the Jos Buttler-captained team put up an underwhelming ODI World Cup defence in November 2023. England’s white-ball squads will depart for the sub-continent on 17 January under the new coach and captain combination of Brendon McCullum and Buttler. The tour includes three ODIs and five IT20s against the white-ball juggernaut of India followed by the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 hosted by Pakistan in February and March. In the first England men’s ODI and IT20 squads to be announced under McCullum’s extended white ball head coach role, two groups of 15 players have been named for each format with Root only selected for the ODIs and Leicestershire leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed named in the T20 squad. After coming out of retirement to play in the 2023 ODI World Cup Ben Stokes was not considered for selection, the talismanic all-rounder continues to be assessed following a left hamstring injury sustained during the third Test match against New Zealand earlier this month. Root is in the middle of a gleaming period of form with the bat, becoming England’s leading Test-match run scorer and century-maker in 2024 culminating in him taking third place in the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award this week. After a chastening period under former coach and captain pairing of Matthew Mott and Buttler in which they relinquished both World titles, England’s white-ball sides are looking to get off to a fresh start in 2025 by returning to an old hand. Root’s recall to the squad for ODIs could even see him overtake Eoin Morgan’s 6,957 runs to become England’s leading runs scorer in the longer of the two white ball formats. After making his ODI debut in India in January 2013, the Yorkshireman can boast an average of 47.60 from 171 matches with 16n centuries and 39 half-centuries, he’ll also offer some handy overs with the ball."
"“There are more statues of Lester Piggott in the UK than there are of sporting women,” said the statistician Chris Stride with dismay. “It is really bad … there are hardly any at all.” In fact, there are a fewer than a handful of sporting women celebrated with public statues. They include the pentathlete Mary Peters on the outskirts of Belfast; the 1930s Wimbledon champion Dorothy Round in Dudley; and the trailblazing footballer Lily Parr at the National Football Museum in Manchester. That is compared with more than 350 men, from Steve Ovett on Brighton seafront to John Curry at the ice skating arena in Sheffield, to a grimly determined arms-folded statue of Alex Ferguson outside Old Trafford in Manchester. Or a joyous, arms-aloft statue of Ferguson outside Pittodrie in Aberdeen. We know this because of the almost obsessive determination of Stride, a senior lecturer of applied statistics at the University of Sheffield and the driving force behind From Pitch to Plinth: the Sporting Statues project. For 14 years, Stride has been leading a team that records and researches statues of sportsmen and women around the world. It is a project without end. In the coming weeks he will add about 20 UK statues and 120 US baseball statues. “There are about 120 football statues across the world we’ve got to add. We find them all the time. They are quite hard to search for on the internet … I can translate the word statue into lots of different languages for you.” Stride began the project in 2010 for the simplest of reasons. “One of my colleagues came into my office and he said he had seen a lot of football statues as he went to games – ‘Do you know how many there are?’ “I’m a statistician. If someone asks how many are there of something, I need to know. I went out and counted how many there were, basically.” He soon realised the interesting thing about the project was not the bald numbers, but the tales behind the statues and what they may tell us about society more widely. “There are so many crazy stories behind them, there are so many interesting people who have come together to put them up,” Stride said. Academically, almost nothing had been written about the subject, which Stride has corrected with zeal. He said that since the 1990s statues had been recognised as an effective marketing tool for sports clubs, a phenomenon that began in the US and spread. The reasons are mixed but “essentially, it has been shown that fans get more attached to a club if they feel nostalgic about it”. They also help give new stadiums, which might look more like warehouses from the outside, some kind of identity which is why, outside Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium, people will find statues of Tony Adams, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Ken Friar and Herbert Chapman, who was Arsenal manager between 1925 and 1934, winning the league four times in five years. Stride said it was interesting that sports statues do not tend to be in the centres of big cities but in smaller places that have often lost traditional industries. “It is the idea of trying to put some identity back into that town. Public art has always been used to try to do that, it’s just that between the 1920s and 80s public art tended to be a bit more arty, more abstract. Surveys showed that the public aren’t really into abstract art.” There was a swing back to figurative art but no appetite for the old figurative art subjects of military heroes or kings and queens, Stride said. It’s a reason places such as Ashington (Jack Charlton) and Barrow (Emlyn Hughes, Willie Horne) have sporting statues. “They’re often towns that have lost their key industries and they are clinging to something which will give them some identity.” Sporting statues are also fascinating for how many get it so wrong. A recent statue of Harry Kane in Walthamstow was widely mocked, joining a roll-call of misfires including a weirdly featured Ronaldo bust at Madeira airport that was lampooned on Saturday Night Live and a 12ft Maradona in Kolkata, India, which was said to look more like Bobby Ewing from Dallas, the football manager Roy Hodgson, or “someone’s gran”. Stride said there was a straightforward reason why so many are bad. “It is a really difficult thing to do. “When I started the project I interviewed a lot of sculptors, maybe 20 or 30 of them, and one thing they collectively said is that sculpting a footballer is actually really difficult. It’s not like the Queen where you’ve only got the head right and then it’s a flowing dress. “With footballers you’ve got the legs, the shape of the body – fans will recognise the shape. The really difficult thing is to get a sense of movement into it.”"
"England claimed a comprehensive 286-run victory in the one-off Test at Bloemfontein after rolling South Africa over for 64 in their second innings – their lowest total in women’s Tests. The success is England’s first Test win in more than a decade – the last came against Australia at Perth in January 2014 – and Heather Knight’s first as captain (she had previously presided over four draws and two defeats). Knight fell 10 runs short of a third Test century in the afternoon session, trapped lbw by Nonkululeko Mlaba, but this result will surely delight her just as much as reaching that personal milestone would have – especially with an Ashes Test at the MCG only six weeks away. “We’ll go to Australia with a lot of confidence and belief in what we do as a side,” Knight said. “It was a really important tour for us, coming off the back of that disappointment at the World Cup. To come away from home, only lose one game, win both white-ball series and win a Test is a monumental effort.” South Africa had fought hard in the first two sessions to bowl England out for 236, but the evening session witnessed a staggering collapse. Lauren Bell, the player of the match, added four more wickets to take her match tally to eight, beginning the South Africa funeral-procession by trapping Laura Wolvaardt lbw, as she once again used her new wobble-ball to great effect. “Performances like that give me a lot of confidence that I’m moving in the right direction,” Bell said. Less than two hours later, Bell ran out Mlaba with a direct hit from mid-off to wrap up the innings, and the match. The fact that Mlaba was short of her ground only because she didn’t bother to ground her bat was a telling sign of the demoralised state of the South Africa camp. It was a disappointing end to a day in which the left-arm spinner had earlier become the first South African to take 10 wickets in a women’s Test – the instrument of an England collapse of their own in which they lost their last six wickets for 54 runs, courtesy of some reckless shot-play across the line. Marizanne Kapp could not bowl due to workload management, while the seamer Ayanda Hlubi was ruled out with a hip injury, but Mlaba gamely shouldered the load. The problem was that England’s lead already extended to 350 by the time they were all out half an hour before tea: the highest successful fourth innings run-chase in women’s Tests is just 198. With the pressure on, four of the South African batters fell lbw: in the absence of DRS, that placed the spotlight firmly on the umpires. But perhaps the most controversial moment was when Annerie Dercksen appeared to bat-pad an obviously clean catch to Tammy Beaumont at short leg, and the umpires sent the decision upstairs, sparking widespread confusion. According to Knight, the referral related to whether it had been a bump ball but South Africa’s coach, Mandla Mashimbyi, said he was baffled by it: “There was no communication and I didn’t understand why. It was quite bizarre.” The concern is that Cricket South Africa may review the result, rue the controversy, and conclude that future women’s Tests are not worth the risk. Mashimbyi, though, said he was “passionate” about the format: “DRS is above my pay grade, but I will make sure that we expose our players to more red-ball stuff.” In any case, England’s raucous celebrations are testament to the fact that Test cricket matters for women as much as for men. “The girls are absolutely buzzing,” Knight said. “To do what we did today is very special.”"
"Konstas’s joyous, impudent 65-ball 60, a debut innings like no other, gave Australia a grip on the game that they may not relinquish. India loosened it slightly during the last session, when they reduced Australia from 237 for 2 to 299 for 6, but overall it was Australia’s day. And it was undeniably Sam Konstas’s day. 86th over: Australia 311-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 6) A swinging yorker from Bumrah is played well by Cummins, who clips it into the leg side for a couple. Those are the last runs of a terrific day’s play, one that will be forever associated with the audacious brilliance of Sam Konstas. 85th over: Australia 308-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 6) Cummins edges Deep wide of third slip for four. He was worried for a split-second and and snapped his head round to follow the ball, but it bounced well short. Deep gets a move on to ensure there will be time for one more over. 84th over: Australia 303-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 1) Bumrah swings one back into Cummins and goes up for LBW. Too high, maybe leg side as well. Cummins takes a couple of leg-byes later in the over before pushing a single to get off the mark. That should be Bumrah’s last over of the day; if so he’ll end with slightly unusual figures of 20-7-72-3. 83rd over: Australia 300-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 0) A leg-bye brings up Australia’s 300. They’re still ahead in the game but India have done well to peg them back from 237 for 2. Deep ends an excellent over with a good delivery that Smith edges onto his inner thigh. He felt that. Good lord, that’s unplayable! Akash Deep, given the new ball ahead of Siraj, starts with a monstrous seaming lifter that Carey tickles through to Pant. It’s Deep’s first wicket of the innings, deserved reward for some terrific bowling. He’s arguably been India’s best bowler today, even though Bumrah has three-for. 82nd over: Australia 299-5 (Smith 68, Carey 31) Bumrah is taking the second new ball now. Two late wickets would make this a pretty good day for India. Carey takes his innings in his hands by running down the track to chip over the leg side. The ball teases mid-on before dropping safely for a couple of runs. A square drive for two more brings up a busy fifty partnership from 76 balls. 81st over: Australia 292-5 (Smith 68, Carey 24) No he’s not; Reddy is going to continue with the old ball. I’m not sure what happened there because Bumrah looked ready to go. There are suggestions it might be because of the light but then Reddy is a seam bowler and I don’t think the umpires can distinguish between fast-medium and medium. Anyway, Reddy bowls another uneventful over that yields just a single for Carey. “A much earlier OBO post enthused about how young Konstas’ knock would be a thrill for the massive Greek community here, especially in my old hometown of Melbourne,” writes Gervase Greene. “It reminded me how remarkable it is that such a huge diaspora here, ridiculously abundant with gifted football and soccer stars, has somehow missed the top cricket tier. For example, even the brilliantly intimidating Marcus Stoinis, I’m fairly sure, has never played an actual Test match. Go figure.” While I’m all for diversity and brilliantly intimidating cricketers, Stoinis isn’t a Test player, is he? 80th over: Australia 291-5 (Smith 68, Carey 23) A maiden from Washington ends act one of this Test match. The second new ball is available and Jasprit Bumrah, back on the field, is going to take it. 79th over: Australia 291-5 (Smith 68, Carey 23) We won’t get the full 90 overs in today, probably more like 84 or 85. Jasprit Bumrah is still off the field but you’d imagine Deep and Siraj will take the new ball in his absence. Reddy has an LBW shout against Carey turned down. It was a nice delivery that jagged back off the seam but Carey got a thick inside edge onto the pad. 78th over: Australia 288-5 (Smith 66, Carey 22) Smith has slowed down slightly since pulling Siraj for six, though it’s unlikely to affect his concentration. It feels like he’s taking a bit of downtime ahead of the second new ball, which will be available in two overs’ time. 77th over: Australia 286-5 (Smith 65, Carey 21) Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has bowled only two overs today, almost strikes with the first ball of a new spell when Smith plays a lazy shot that bounces just over the stumps. That was really close. 76th over: Australia 282-5 (Smith 63, Carey 19) Washington has been tidy without really threatening. The wicket of Labuschagne came from an unforced error. But he is at least holding up an end to get India through to the second new ball. “I’m going to claim providing Geoff with that Mr Smith Goes to Washington line a few years ago,” writes Ray Murphy. “He even replied at the time giving an ‘elephant stamp’ for creativity.” Bumrah had some treatment during the drinks break and is now leaving the field. He’s walking freely but that’s a concern for India; it looks like a calf problem. Might just be cramp. 75th over: Australia 279-5 (Smith 62, Carey 18) Carey sniffs at a good delivery from Siraj and is beaten. A misfield from Bumrah at long on – not his first of the day – turns one run into two, and there’s another misfield in the covers off the next delivery. Oh dear. Time for drinks. 74th over: Australia 276-5 (Smith 62, Carey 15) Carey jumps all over Washington Sundar, slog-sweeping handsomely over wide mid-on for six more. He has quietly had a terrific year with the bat, averaging just shy of 40. “Packing up the house for a move to the UK,” writes Don. “Not a single box was filled during Konstas’s fab knock. Since then we’ve done ten. I wonder how the cloning boffins at CA are going? A couple of Heads, a couple of Konstases and a handful of Cumminses should just about do it! That’s an Ashes series I’d like to watch.” Especially if England had a load of Brooks, Roots and Woods. 73rd over: Australia 269-5 (Smith 62, Carey 8) Siraj replaces Bumrah, who took care of business in a short spell of 3-0-14-2. He’ll be back with the second new ball you’d imagine. Smith punches a nice drive for three; the loss of those three wickets has not changed his batting one iota. To prove the point, he pulls the last ball of the over mightily over square leg for six. This is the best I’ve seen him bat in a long time. A couple of you have mentioned the Mr Smith/Washington line a few overs ago. I can’t take credit for that; Geoff (I think) referenced it during the 2020-21 series and it’s been burned in the memory ever since. Steal from the best and all that. 72nd over: Australia 258-5 (Smith 53, Carey 6) “Packing up the house for a move to the UK,” writes Don. “Not a single box was filled during Konstas’s fab knock. Since then we’ve done ten. I wonder how the cloning boffins at CA are going? A couple of Heads, a couple of Konstases and a handful of Cumminses should just about do it! That’s an Ashes series I’d like to watch.” That brief innings from Mitch Marsh continued a run of form that is becoming a concern. These are his scores in Tests this year: 54, 5, 21, 10, 40, 0, 0, 80, 6, 47, 9, 5, 2, 4. 71st over: Australia 254-5 (Smith 50, Carey 5) Bumrah is slightly too straight to the new batter Carey, who is able to work him behind square for a couple of singles. Smith pushes another into the off side to reach a serene, authoritative half-century from 71 balls. He’s looked terrific. A poor over by Bumrah’s standards ends with a wide delivery that Carey cuts for two. 70th over: Australia 248-5 (Smith 48, Carey 1) Carey pushes Washington for a single to get off the mark. I’m surprised Rohit hasn’t gone in for the kill and brought Siraj back at this end. I know the second new ball is due after 80 overs but if necessary you could leave it until the morning; this is the time to strike. 69th over: Australia 246-5 (Smith 47, Carey 0) Since drinks Australia have lose three for 12 in four overs. Smith is squared up by Bumrah and gets a leading edge into the off side for a single. Again, India won’t mind that as it gives Bumrah the chance of five deliveries at Marsh. That’s all he needs. Marsh drives nicely for four, is hit on the glove by a nasty lifter and then top-edges a lusty pull through to Rishabh Pant. He’s usually so good on the pull but that zipped off the pitch and was on him too quickly. I’m not sure it was short enough for the shot either. 68th over: Australia 241-4 (Smith 46, Marsh 0) Smith carries on as if nothing has changed, rolling his wrists to collect a single off Washington’s first ball. Marsh defends the rest of the over. 67th over: Australia 240-4 (Smith 45, Marsh 0) Even on a day when he’s been nowhere near his best, Bumrah has taken 2 for 53 and is on the prowl for more. Bumrah returns in the hope of getting Travis Head early. Smith drives his first ball for three, the third run coming after a misfield from Siraj. I wonder if that was deliberate to get Head on strike. If it was, Siraj is a twisted genius because Head has gone for a duck! He shouldered arms to an immaculate delivery from round the wicket that came back just enough to trim the off bail. Now then. 66th over: Australia 237-3 (Smith 42, Head 0) The new batter is India’s Kryptonite. But if they can get him early they’ll be back in the contest. The drinks break has done for Marnus Labuschagne. He charged the first ball of the next over and swished a drive towards mid-off, where Kohli leapt to take a good catch. Labuschagne leaves the field in a manner that almost redefines the phrase “trudging off”; he can’t believe he’s given his wicket away like that. 65th over: Australia 237-2 (Labuschagne 72, Smith 42) Yikes. Out of nothing, Deep gets one to spit from a length and beat Labuschagne. It straightened a touch as well, which might actually have saved Labuschagne. This has been an impressive old-ball spell from Deep, one that deserves better than figures of 6-1-26-0. 64th over: Australia 233-2 (Labuschagne 69, Smith 41) Mr Smith goes after Washington, charging down the pitch to blast a straight drive for four. This is looking very ominous for India, not just in this game but also ahead of the Sydney Test. Khawaja, Labuschagne and Smith are all in a far better place than they were at the start of the series. 63rd over: Australia 226-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 36) Labuschagne and Smith are the most prolific third-wicket partnership in Australian Test history, with around 2350 runs at an average of 60. It’s been a while since their last century stand, though, which was at Lord’s in 2023. They may rectify that in the next hour. Smith mistimes a pull over midwicket for three to take the partnership to 72. “Is there any shade on the ground?” says Adam Humphries. “If there is, I’d be parking Bumrah in it and bringing him on late in the day. Seems to be the Aussies’ day, but the visitors might get a bit lucky as the finish of play approaches with a rested strike bowler.” It must be so difficult to resist the temptation to bowl him, especially when you’re in as much trouble as India are here. I agree, though; I’d be inclined to let him rest until either the second new ball is available or Travis Head arrives at the crease. 62nd over: Australia 223-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 33) Washington appeals unsuccessfully for LBW when Labuschagne misses a reverse sweep. Scratch that, replays show he gloved it. Rohit looked slightly more inclined to review that than the Deep appeal, but not with only one left. 61st over: Australia 221-2 (Labuschagne 66, Smith 32) For the third time in this spell, Deep begs Joel Wilson to give Smith out LBW. It was a good delivery which straightened off the seam to hit Smith on the back leg, but it looked quite high and there’s no chance Rohit Sharma can risk his last review on that. Replays confirm it was bouncing over and was probably going down leg. A maiden from Deep, perhaps his best over to date, includes a beauty that beats Smith outside off. 60th over: Australia 221-2 (Labuschagne 66, Smith 32) Washington Sundar replces Jadeja, who grazes with figures of 14-2-54-1. Four singles from the over, all taken with minimal risk. It feels like India are entering a world of pain. 59th over: Australia 217-2 (Labuschagne 64, Smith 30) Deep beats Labuschagne with a clever wide outswinger. Given Labuschagne’s recent struggles, it’s odd that India haven’t tempted himwith more deliveries like that. Runs continue to flow, with 40 in six overs since tea. Labuschagne pulls for three, Smith fences through the slips for three more and then a Bumrah misfield gives Labuschagne a second run. “Hey Rob, multicultural crowd of over 80,000,” says Ray Murphy. “Is there a better Leviathan-sized ground in the world to watch cricket?” I’m probably not the best person to ask, but none come to mind. 58th over: Australia 208-2 (Labuschagne 58, Smith 27) Smith rocks back to cart Jadeja wide of mid-on for four more. That brings up a ruthless fifty partnership from 82 balls; Smith celebrates by mauling the next delivery back over Jadeja’s head for four more. 57th over: Australia 199-2 (Labuschagne 57, Smith 19) I’m not sure Rohit would have reviewed that if the score was, say, 50 for 2. It was on the desperate side of optimistic. Smith is not out! Smith shuffled a long way across, missed a flick to leg and was hit on the knee roll. But it was doing too much and would have missed leg stump, so India are down to their last review. India review for LBW against Smith! Deep has another huge LBW shout turned down, but this time Rohit goes upstairs. My hunch is umpire’s call on line, though it’s really close. 56th over: Australia 197-2 (Labuschagne 56, Smith 19) Labuschagne, who is batting with increasing fluency, glides Jadeja for two and then spanks an inside-out drive to the extra-cover boundary. Lovely batting. India have got problems. 55th over: Australia 190-2 (Labuschagne 50, Smith 18) Akash Deep, on for Bumrah, has a big LBW shout against Smith first ball. It’s turned down by Joel Wilson and Rohit Sharma declines a review because of height. It was pretty close, mind, and would have been umpire’s call had they gone upstairs. Smith takes seven from two deliveries later in the over, flicking to fine leg and driving three more through extra cover. Labuschagne fiddles a couple through the slips to reach a vital, hard-fought fifty from 114 balls. Australia are in such a good position here. 54th over: Australia 181-2 (Labuschagne 48, Smith 11) Labuschagne sets the agenda for the evening session by running down the track to slap Jadeja over mid-on for four. While it’s too early to be talking about a 12th Test hundred, he does look comfortable out there. The players are back out there. It’ll be an extended evening session, with 37 overs still to be bowled. Ravindra Jadeja will take care of the first. Teatime reading A cracking piece here from Jack Snape on a debut innings like no other. More than anything, Konstas had belied expectation. On debut, against Bumrah, in the first session on Boxing Day, it should be not be possible to play the way Konstas did. He charged down the pitch to Siraj short of a length, cut a middle stump-bound yorker for four, and produced more ramps than Arisa Trew’s backyard. 53rd over: Australia 176-2 (Labuschagne 44, Smith 10) Finally, on the stroke of tea, Washington Sundar comes on to bowl. He starts around the wicket with a slip, leg slip and short leg. Labuschagne is beaten by a good delivery that zips across him from round the wicket, then strides forward to drive classily to the long-off boundary. That’s the end of a good session for Australia, who consolidated the work of Sam Konstas by scoring 64 runs in 28 overs for the loss of Usman Khawaja. India’s tiring bowlers are facing the prospect of a Headache in the evening session. 52nd over: Australia 171-2 (Labuschagne 40, Smith 9) It feels like Australia have weathered the brief storm that followed Khawaja’s unexpected dismissal. Jadeja, who is bowling accurately but with little help from the pitch, is milked for three singles. 51st over: Australia 168-2 (Labuschagne 39, Smith 7) Labuschagne and Smith are taking no risks against Bumrah, unlike Sam Konstas earlier in the day. I’m wary of recency bias but all but we’ll surely reflect on that as one of the most audacious debut innings ever played. Kevin Pietersen dumping Glenn McGrath back over his head for six comes to mind, but he was 25, not 19. Ashton Agar’s 98 was awesome in a different way. 50th over: Australia 165-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 6) Smith mistimes a pull off Jadeja but it beats Sundar at mid-on and runs away for four. Just under ten minutes to go until tea; as things stand it’s Australia’s session. 49th over: Australia 161-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 2) Bumrah snaps an absolute jaffa past Labuschagne’s outside edge. Kohli appealed from slip but nobody else was interested. This is a good spell for India, who are building some pressure, and Australia will be happy to get to tea without losing any more wickets. A yorker from wide on the crease is jabbed into the ground and over gully for a couple by Labuschagne, who flicks two more behind square to end the over. 48th over: Australia 157-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 2) Smith drives Jadeja for a couple to get off the mark. “Always love the almost poetic description we get from you,” writes Mark in Cleveland, though I should stress he’s talking about Geoff rather than me. “This piece from earlier only needed a tweak to become a first innings Haiku. Khawaja this time. Stretching for a ball, to slip? Again, Deep sorrow. 47th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Bumrah tries an elaborate off-break that is defended by Labuschagne, then walks back to his mark smiling at anything and everything. Geniuses are rarely as happy-go-lucky as Bumrah. Another maiden ends with Labuschagne edging a good one short of slip. Labuschagne has slowed down as his innings has progressed: 21 from the first 43 balls, 13 from the next 47. 46th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Jadeja is bowling very straight to the right-handers as usual, with a slip and short leg in place. Labuschagne waves a quick single to mid-off and Smith defends the last two balls. 45th over: Australia 154-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 0) That’s such a bonus for India, especially as Bumrah is at the start of his spell and could do some game-changing damage. The new batter Steve Smith nicks his fourth ball on the bounce to second slip, a lovely delivery that squared him up. A wicket maiden. “T20 has ruined Test cricket,” writes Simon T. “Should’ve seen off the new ball with solid defensives or (preferably) studious leaves. Good luck to the young fella but I’ve hardly settled in to my salmon sarnies &amp; Chardonnay…” Jasprit Bumrah strikes with the first ball of a new spell! It was a rancid delivery, short on leg stump, but Khawaja was through his pull shot too early and toe-ended it in slow motion to midwicket. Bumrah puts his hands over his face in mock-embarrassment. All those snorters he bowled this morning and he gets a wicket with that. 44th over: Australia 154-1 (Khawaja 57, Labuschagne 33) Labuschagne dances down to Jadeja, is nowhere near the pitch and switches to a defensive stroke. A maiden. 43rd over: Australia 154-1 (Khawaja 57, Labuschagne 33) Labuschagne times Siraj sweetly through mid-off, the first boundary in eight overs, anf dollows up with a clip through midwicket for three. Australia are in such a good position, one that would have been unimaginable this morning when seven of the first 10 deliveries went past the outside edge. 42nd over: Australia 146-1 (Khawaja 56, Labuschagne 26) Labuschagne waves Jadeja inside out for a couple to extend this methodical second-wicket partnership to 57. This is such a great opportunity for Australia to take control of the match and series. Perth is starting to seem forever ago. 41st over: Australia 143-1 (Khawaja 55, Labuschagne 24) Khawaja, who is back in his bubble after three difficult Tests, flicks Siraj for another single. Labuschagne drops another on the off side and Khawaja flicks a third to fine leg., Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy, ostensibly picked as bowling allrounders, have bowled two overs between them. If India lose this series they will lament some peculiar selections. That said, they are desperately missing Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Shami. “A decade or so ago there was a lot of online action around watermelon boy,” writes Pete. “Has there been another fruit-based crowd hero since? I’ll be on the lookout from my couch today.” He’s not among the crowd but Sam Konstas blew a few raspberries in India’s direction. 40th over: Australia 140-1 (Khawaja 53, Labuschagne 23) Jadeja spits one past Labuschagne, who was beaten more by the bounce than the turn as he tried to cut. He decides to take precisely no risks for the remainder of the over. “Christmas Day here in North Carolina,” write Alex and Katelyn. “The first time I told my half-Swedish, half-American partner I loved her was during an Australia-Pakistan match last year and we are freshly engaged sitting down to watch a spot of today’s action. No sound on, as a compromise.” That’s really rather lovely. Congratulations! 39th over: Australia 140-1 (Khawaja 53, Labuschagne 23) Khawaja flicks Siraj through square leg for a single; Labuschagne steals another on the off side. You never know with such things but it does feel like Konstas deserves an assist for some of these runs; from an Australian batting perspective, his innings has changed the mood of the whole series. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Any chance we can pause this match and relive Sam Konstas’s knock again? There have been something like 91,515 innings played in Test cricket; few, if any, were as eye-catchingly unique as Konstas’s 60. 38th over: Australia 138-1 (Khawaja 52, Labuschagne 22) The medium mediums of Nitish Kumar Reddy frighten nobody, especially when he bowls a bouncer that Labuschagne happily ducks, genuflecting. Wendy Cowling has finished off dinner recently. “Mixture of fruity and nutty Christmas pudding with top-quality vanilla ice cream - was a great success, although a brother-in-law poked at his serving after the first spoonful and in a suspicious voice said: ‘I think this has spices in it.’” Mystifies me how some people live their lives afraid of any food that isn’t a petrol station sausage roll. Drinks break. From here, your guide will be Rob Smyth. Please direct to him your emails, and hopefully he’s not blocked from his inbox by a rogue workplace router. 37th over: Australia 137-1 (Khawaja 51, Labuschagne 22) Siraj again, flying down the leg side. It feels like with Konstas having made the runs, these two can just squash the life out of India’s fast bowlers, then the rest can come in and profit. Trouble looming for India if they don’t break this pairing soon. Siraj settles for trying to break Labuschagne’s pair, again zeroing in on the testicles. If only someone hung a box on middle stump, Siraj might bowl full enough to hit it. 36th over: Australia 136-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 22) Very late in the piece, India’s fourth seamer has a shot. Innocuous first offering in the 120s. 35th over: Australia 134-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 21) Struck again by Siraj is Labuschagne, though this time mercifully it misses the box and hits more thigh. It draws an error to follow, a top-edged hook shot that lands safe and picks up four runs fine. It’s all going Australia’s way today, aside from the nut shots. Then a couple to square, and another near collision as Labuschagne dashes a single and clips Siraj, who gives him a long look. “Is Marnus channeling Wally Grout here?” asks Greg Wood. “Don’t rub em, just count ‘em?” 34th over: Australia 123-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 14) Khawaja moves again, a lovely on drive from a rare overpitched Deep delivery. Rather more streaky as he reaches for a rising ball and slices it between slip and gully. Konstas reached fifty in 52 balls, Khawaja in almost twice as many. Neil Brandom is far from Melbourne. “It’s Christmas afternoon in Orange County, California. We get the sketchy Fox coverage through Willow. More importantly, your OBO alerts me to sneak away from our Christmas gathering (who know nothing of cricket) to watch highlights.” Tactical, I like it. 33rd over: Australia 119-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 14) Straight in the bowl of Jatz crackers there from Siraj, who is booed as he starts a new spell. Labuschagne the unlucky wearer of the contact, and he makes it two on two the next ball! This time he’s down for longer, on his knees on the pitch. He looks up to Siraj with a rueful smile, as if to say, would you mind aiming somewhere else? Good inward movement from Siraj, but if I may repeat a point, the length isn’t threatening the stumps. It’s only threatening a length. Labuschagne needs a physio visit after the second blow, really just to give him time for a drink and a breather while he pretends to have a chat. 32nd over: Australia 119-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 14) The nicks aren’t carrying. Khawaja this time, stretching for a ball, short of slip. Again, Deep sorrow. 31st over: Australia 118-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 13) An overstep for Bumrah in the over, his first of those today, though his rhythm is still good enough to get an edge from Labuschagne from a different ball. It doesn’t carry to slip though. “Slumped in front of the telly is the only way to spend Boxing Day. The swirling heat outside makes it even better, though that’s tempered by the thought of those facing a fire threat in western Victoria,” writes David Meiklejohn. “Question: is Kohli in trouble? Or are the conspiracy theorists (ICC=BCCI) right and he’ll get off with a light slap on the wrist?” Well, it’s not a conspiracy theory when it’s demonstrably true, as that contention is. The Indian board sets terms at ICC meetings and the others are financially obliged to accede. So, the chance of Kohli being suspended is non-existent. If he were to be, India would probably refuse to play in Sydney and CA would be out millions of dollars. He might get some demerit points. 30th over: Australia 116-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 12) Runs at last! Four of them, Khawaja getting a full piece of a pull shot off a fast bowler for the first time today. Out through midwicket. Thoroughly beaten on the next two balls though, trying to drive. Deep is coming around the wicket and seaming the ball away. Gosh, he’s been an unlucky bowler in this series. Beats Khawaja a third time, again forcing the rabbit hop on the crease. I can’t fathom how that movement helps the batter control a shot. Any batting coaches out there, drop us a line. 29th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Four maidens in a row. Labuschagne handles Bumrah watchfully but without any alarms in this over, trying to defend incoming balls to leg, trying to leave outside off. 28th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Deep is giving Khawaja a hard time. Another ball that beats him, another jumping fend at it. There is still enough there for the bowlers, but India can’t break through. Three overs since lunch, no run. 27th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Bumrah from the Shane Warne Stand End. Rides his little imaginary horse up to the crease, then catapults. Labuschagne gets one off the gloves trying to glance, then one towards gully trying to press. Another appeal for a leg-side catch but nobody except Bumrah thinks there was a touch. In fact that was miles from the glove. Rohit pretends to review and then pulls out, laughing. 26th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) We’re back with Akash Deep, and it’s another maiden, in that groove outside Khawaja’s off stump. The opener is still playing on his toes a lot of the time. Trying to catch up on a few emails. One from Ibby Usman, before the break. “That’s absolutely embarrassing from Kohli. 35 years old, tens of thousands of runs, however many centuries, and he’s shoulder barging a 19 year old, then playing the victim. Never thought I’d say this, but I wish Warner was out there when that happened.” I generally try not to make assumptions about what players are thinking, rather than doing, but it’s hard to see how Kohli could have been genuinely surprised by the contact after walking towards the other player. We’re about to resume after lunch. It’s still hot and still cloudy in Melbourne. India need to find a way to get some equilibrium back after that break. Shiona Biswas is feeling upbeat. “It’s a working holiday season for me albeit while also spending time with old friends. Having grown up on the other side of the world in India, tuning in to the Boxing Day test brings me extra cheer today.” Glad to hear that. What a session. A hundred runs in it, Australia already on top, and it came from an injection of what could be deemed audacity or foolishness, depending on your view, that was undeniably allied with a lot of skill. Sam Konstas said that he would take on Bumrah and take on India, and he did: scooping, ramping, reversing, charging, all of the above. It won’t always work, and it very nearly didn’t work a number of times here, but it got him a score and it got Australia the impetus. Now they have a big advantage on which to build a lead. 25th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Two more for Khawaja off the outside edge, he’s building a handy score here. He needs one, and it needs to be bigger than this. It’s still cloudy at the G, as Bumrah gets bounce and Khawaja fends it away, lucky that it goes to ground. The clock ticks past lunch time. Khawaja glances a run. Bumrah appeals for a leg-side catch from Labuschagne, but no dice. And that’s that. 24th over: Australia 109-1 (Khawaja 35, Labuschagne 12) Deep rolls back in, Labuschagne wristing two runs through midwicket. Khawaja drives what should be one but Siraj misfields at mid off, conceding three. “In all of the Konstas hype, can we not add that he is debuting in the city with the largest Greek population outside Greece, and about the sixth or seventh largest with Greece included? I hope everyone is raising a spanakopita to him in Melissa’s Cafe, Smith Street, my first stop every time I am in Melbourne.” We can add that, Peter Salmon, this is an open forum. Wait, that’s Roman. Lucky I’m not agora phobic. We did a homemade spanakopita for Christmas lunch, it was top notch. 23rd over: Australia 103-1 (Khawaja 32, Labuschagne 9) Bumrah back for a quick burst before lunch, maybe two overs, and he’s nasty immediately. Two balls in a row leaping at Khawaja’s gloves, played off the handle almost as the batter flinches. Then pad, but via an inside edge. No run from the over. Sam Konstas is down at the edge of the player’s race signing shirts and taking selfies. Why not? The crowd wave is circling the ground. Atmosphere here is top notch. 22nd over: Australia 103-1 (Khawaja 32, Labuschagne 9) Jadeja to Labuschagne, a deft late cut brings four runs. Next ball, another one, finer! Bumping up the scoreboard close to lunch. I’ve finally worked out how to route some emails off my phone through about three other intermediaries to have them show up as text messages. Every other website at the MCG is blocked, somehow. Anyway, here’s an expert on my opening subject: his name is Russell Yule. “My great-great grandfather emigrated from a Scandinavian state a while back to England before my great grandfather emigrated to Queensland in the early 1900s. Our family name was changed to ‘Yule’ because the original ‘Juïlle’ wasn’t, ahem, gaining traction, so great granddad went with a phonetic spelling. My understanding is that the Yule log was a large log that had been chosen based on its ability to burn for a long time. This was to celebrate a Pagan winter solstice celebration in the long hall where the party would last as long as the log was burning. Generally it was considered poor form if the log burnt out in less than 8 days. If you’re snowbound for a while, you might as well enjoy it… There are some sacrifices to be made. The Yule Goat (or reindeer buck) was a big part of the celebration in order to safeguard the New Year harvest. There was also a pig sacrifice as well but since the wet blankets at head office decided that sacrificing live animals was not okay, sacrifices were made. Smaller Yule Goat ornaments are now made from straw, (and apparently available from Ikea!), which burns well. It is a common game to try to sneak a Yule Goat ornament under a neighbouring friend or family Yule tree. Once discovered the game is to sneak it on to someone else’s Yule tree. Oh those wacky Scandos! The Yule ‘Pigs’ are now often made from the corn meal from the last ear of corn from the previous harvest. A pig head is baked from the cornmeal and rather than being even is broken up and spread over the corn field to promote a prosperous harvest. There is also a Yule Cat that decides, based on whether children get new clothes or not, if children have been good/worthy of presents. The thinking being that only good children would get new clothes. There’s a thought that bad children would then be offered to the Yule Cat who would spirit them away. Possibly based on the very real fact that children who didn’t get new clothes wouldn’t survive the winter.” 21st over: Australia 92-1 (Khawaja 29, Labuschagne 1) Some leaving, a run, a leg bye, another quiet Deep over. Super weird seeing players just carry on like the game is normal, after that opening stand. It’s like the awkward resumption of conversation after a fight at family Christmas when the offending parties have been ushered outside. 20th over: Australia 90-1 (Khawaja 28, Labuschagne 1) Normal service resumes, then, with two of Australia’s regulars in the middle. Oh, what a piece of bowling from Jadeja! Just as I was thinking about Australian tons on debut, about Ponting’s 96, and all that stuff. Around the wicket, down the line of the stumps, drawing a big forward defensive lunge from Konstas. The ball straightens just enough to beat the edge and strikes his back leg. Konstas doesn’t bother reviewing. Immense ovation for the young player as he walks off though, and the MCG gives you a long runway to keep soaking up that applause. He was chancy, he was dramatic, and he found his own unique way to nullify the threat of a Bumrah opening spell. 19th over: Australia 89-0 (Konstas 60, Khawaja 28) Three more for Konstas, driving Deep at the top of the bounce out through cover. “Are middle aged men allowed to swoon?” a friend messages me. 18th over: Australia 86-0 (Konstas 57, Khawaja 28) Jadeja goes through Konstas, past the bat, but the ball is just too far down leg. Umpire says no and it’s a good call. Jadeja agrees, eventually, and that’s a good call too. Konstas drives a run, then gets the strike back, and drives another. Seems to have settled down from his early adrenaline rush. 17th over: Australia 83-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 27) Another drinks break, in the heat. India have been thoroughly disconcerted, it must be said. You could see Kohli speaking to teammates after that collision complaining the Konstas had put a shoulder into him, miming a big shoulder movement coming forward. But Kohli is the one who made a beeline close to the other player. I’m sure there’ll be much more about that later. Konstas does the remote camera interview at the drinks break, but won’t say anything about the bump when asked. Akash Deep resumes after the break, and gets through a maiden over in the channel outside Khawaja’s off stump. Three overs for five runs, he has. Siraj meanwhile has gone at 4.8 an over, and Bumrah at 6.3. 16th over: Australia 83-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 27) Spin, at last. Jadeja to Khawaja though, I want to see what Konstas does against slow bowling. Presumably he’ll try to murder it. No need though, as Khawaja pulls the second ball for four. It wasn’t short, but Khawaja gets down very low with a straight front leg to manufacture the length and get power through his shot. Punches one off the back foot. 15th over: Australia 78-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 22) Again, Deep makes things slow down a bit. Bowls most of the over to Khawaja. One run from a top edged pull. 14th over: Australia 77-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 21) A remarkable morning. It’s not even midday yet, and the kid has 50 at almost a run a ball. He’s taken down the biggest threat by treating him like a T20 bowler. Gets there with an inside squeeze to leg, and he makes Khawaja work those twilight-of-a-career legs to race back for two. Salutes the crowd, then follows up by slotting Siraj for a monster pull shot over the longest part of the ground. Just lands inside the rope. He’s done that a lot today. Hopefully the memory of that gives him some solace as he gets his box crushed next ball. 13th over: Australia 65-0 (Konstas 48, Khawaja 20) We get a brief pause for breath, as Konstas faces four balls from Akash Deep but elects to have a little look at him before trying anything. 12th over: Australia 65-0 (Konstas 47, Khawaja 17) More Siraj. Try a spinner, surely? Khawaja tucks one, Konstas flays a cut shot to deep third for two. Misses a hook shot at a bouncer. 11th over: Australia 62-0 (Konstas 45, Khawaja 16) It’s official, Konstas is winning the battle. He’s got Bumrah into a sixth over in this heat, he’s just had an earful from Kohli, and he smokes an off drive for four! Finally a normal shot, and an imposing one. Feeling good about that, he smacks one over long on for six! Reaches for it outside off stump, again the length is fuller, and he gets the length to land it on the rope just around from the old Bay 13. Four more! T20 shot again, backs away and squirts the full straight ball away through backward point this time. Then opens his stance again and tries to pound more over long off, this one mistimed for two runs. This is absolutely extraordinary. He’s taken 18 off that Bumrah over after 14 off an over earlier. Nathan McSweeney would have done the same. 10th over: Australia 44-0 (Konstas 27, Khawaja 16) Early drinks break. Apologies I haven’t got to any emails, the internet connection at the ground has somehow torpedoed access to that server while allowing everything else. I’ll just have to believe that they were witty, erudite, and insightful. I can imagine a bunch of confused late-night English readers trying to work out how Zak Crawley is playing for Australia: tall, right-handed, and throwing the bat without concern. Konstas plays through cover for a couple, then charges Siraj and belts back a drive that hits the bowler. Again Siraj has a few words and the crowd get on his back. Kohli doesn’t say anything, skipping down level with the batter to field, but looks at him with what I would interpret as contempt. Konstas doesnt’ mind, charging again to belt a cut shot for four! Then pulls, splices, high over the leg side for one, into a gap. Huh, now Kohli really is getting into Konstas. They bump shoulders at the end of the over, Kohli walking beside the pitch towards Siraj. Kohli moves his line partly but not enough, perhaps expecting Konstas to do the same. They clip quite forcefully, then Kohli turns to give the young player an earful. Khawaja comes up and shoos Kohli away, Umpire Gough gets involved as well. Boiling over. 9th over: Australia 37-0 (Konstas 20, Khawaja 16) Change in the field for the bouncer, Bumrah to Konstas. Deep square leg, deep fine leg, deep third set quite fine. Two slips, gully, point. Konstas is clueless to the ball cutting in, but it goes too far to leg before hitting his pad. Then he edges on just short of slip! Kohli diving across can’t get it. Skews a single through square leg and gets off strike. Bumrah’s first crack at Khawaja and he immediately goes past the left-hander’s edge. But Khawaja gets the last ball of the over off his pads for four, behind square. Nicely timed. 8th over: Australia 32-0 (Konstas 20, Khawaja 12) Still digesting this. Bumrah’s over went for 14. It’s not like he was collared though. I wouldn’t say that Konstas hit any of those scoop shots flush, or that it seems a viable long-term strategy. But he’s shaken things up. Khawaja pulls three more from Siraj, Konstas gets one off an inside edge, Khawaja drives two. Runs flowing. 7th over: Australia 26-0 (Konstas 19, Khawaja 7) Finally, Konstas connects with his scoop shot! Not completely cleanly, it takes the inside portion and goes much straighter than intended, over the keeper more than fine leg. And it trickles to the rope rather than racing. But he does get four. And goes again! For six! That one is cleaner, and it’s a reverse. Absurd shot. Bumrah has had enough and goes for the yorker. It’s a pretty good one, tailing in at off stump. But Konstas is either expecting it, or is fast enough to adapt. He gets in position, has the bat down for the full pitch, then seeing the line, falls with his body towards the leg side rather than continuing to the off, and opens the face to hit it very fine over deep third. It carries the rope by a few inches. Third ball, charges and tries to flat bat through cover, misses. Fourth ball, leaves. Fifth ball, plays the same reverse scoop to another full ball, and it lands just short of the rope. Replay says four, not six. This is utterly absurd. 6th over: Australia 12-0 (Konstas 5, Khawaja 7) Siraj to Khawaja, across him. It’s been a tale of two battles so far, all of Khawaja down one end and Konstas down the other. Khawaja has soft hands as he runs one into the gully, no score. Finally the ends change, as Khawaja pulls without timing it, clunking three through square, and Kinstas will face Siraj for the first time. Smashes his pad first ball. Was there an inside edge? Guess not, the ball lands with the cordon. Konstas follows up with a huge charge and swing! Baseball style, aimed nowhere and everywhere, and fresh air again. Siraj doesn’t much enjoy that audacity, and has some words. The big screen flashes a close-up of him speaking and the crowd immediately razzes him. But Konstas gets a score to follow, three runs through square leg on the flick. Australia double their score that over. 5th over: Australia 6-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 4) The Bumrah-Konstas show resumes, and the new guy tries the scoop again! This ball was even less the one for it, fuller but wide of the off stump. The bat is nowhere near it. Rohit chuckles, Kohli just shakes his head in mild disapproval. You can’t bat like that after two career runs, buddy, he seems to be thinking. Bumrah ends the over by nearly bursting through, taking a sliver of bat onto the other player’s foot. 4th over: Australia 6-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 4) What do you know – an incorrect review with Siraj’s encouragement. The ball does bend in to the left-hander and smash Khawaja on the pad, but it’s near the knee roll and he’s on the march towards the bowler. Always going over, but India burn one early to see the green light. Siraj at least turned to the umpire eventually, after running down level with the batsman first. Then swings one down leg side, and Khawaja gets a little inside feather on it to fine leg for four. 3rd over: Australia 2-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 0) Huge ovation for Konstas with his first Test runs, getting a straighter ball from Bumrah that he can stab off his pads through square leg for two. Then plays a very clunky forward defence and gets bat on ball again. Bumrah could be bowling fuller, everything so far is over the stumps. He’s enjoying the contest though, smiling at Konstas every couple of balls, as if to say, I can work you out, young feller. So Konstas plays the scoop! Eleventh ball of his Test career, against the best quick in the world. And misses. The ball goes over his off bail. A bit fuller… Bumrah walks back chuckling and shaking his head. And last ball of the over, beats him again! 2nd over: Australia 0-0 (Konstas 0, Khawaja 0) Now then, India need quality from the other end. Some support for Bumrah. It did start to come in Brisbane, before the last-day rain. Siraj with the new Kooka, and he does beat Khawaja with a good one, Khawaja playing on the top as he has done so often while getting out this series. And again, fourth ball, sparring, kangaroo style, bounce and movement. Khawaja survives the over. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Konstas 0, Khawaja 0) There’s a real good lip curl from Konstas on the close-up cam, waiting for Bumrah. The crowd hushes in anticipation… and sighs as he leaves the ball. A big jerky action, shouldering arms over the top of the ball and pulling his bat around to face back down the pitch. Plays and misses at the next one, a pearler that goes away off the pitch. Bumrah doing heaps early. Draws another leave third ball, but the fourth and the fifth are lovely. Beaten, beaten again, both times drawing Konstas into the defensive shot before seaming past the edge. Perfect seam position, upright then scrambling away. And the sixth ball same again! Just misses the edge. Bumrah excited, but doesn’t go through with his appeal. Didn’t bowl an in-ducker in that over, I wonder if he’s going for an extended setup. Konstas beats Khawaja to the middle by about 150 metres. Runs out there and regards the pitch. The young and the old. Anthems go around the ground. We’re not full yet, but well on the way to full. Mitch Starc has had a haircut. Boland has too. Marsh and Konstas have not, by the looks. The Torres Strait and Aboriginal flags fly on poles between the larger Australian and Indian national flags, which are held flat like bedsheets ready to be folded. Done, away we go. And a big piece of news about India’s XI. I wasn’t expecting this. Gill is out so they can play two spinners, with Jadeja at six. Rohit goes up to three. Australia Usman Khawaja Sam Konstas Marnus Labuschagne Steve Smith Travis Head Mitch Marsh Alex Carey Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc Nathan Lyon Scott Boland India Yashasvi Jaiswal KL Rahul Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Rishabh Pant Ravindra Jadeja Nitish Kumar Reddy Washington Sundar Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj Akash Deep Weather report from the ground: it is already hot out there, but it’s currently cloudy. So that’s some measure of relief at least. I suspect it will burn away soon, although there’s also a chance of rain in the forecast and a cool change later. The whole Melbourne grab-bag. I’ll tell you what is certain: Indian support. My word, the crowd outside is at least half wearing blue India shirts. Huge lines on the way in. Huge toss to win! No surprises there, with the heat and the gusty winds blowing across Melbourne. Tell us about your day, whether you’re at the end of it on one half of the planet, or it is already yesterday on the other. Who ate what? Who annoyed who? Who is filled with seasonal cheer? Get salty, get schmaltzy, get smoochy – whatever you like. The email line is open. Here’s our lead-in piece on Konstas and his forerunner, Ricky Ponting. The biggest news for Australia is the debut of young sensation Sam Konstas to open the batting. Huge challenge for him, especially if he’s called upon immediately. Although that would give him less time to get nervous, I suppose. He seems pretty confident, but walking out in front of 90,000 would have to challenge any teenage bravado. Scott Boland is coming back for Australia replacing the injured Josh Hazlewood. Not sure what India will do yet, they always play their cards close and always seem to make a change somewhere along the line. Happy tidings of the Yule. Now that I think about it, I’ve never thought to check what Yule means. Yuletide could be the guy from The King and I doing an album of Vance Joy covers. Regardless, what with all of those logs and whatnot, I’m going to assume that most people had a festive time. In most of Australia, Christmas was stinking hot, in the UK it’s been cold and bleh to a moderate sort of level, and wherever else you were in the world, it was something else. Or still is something else, for those on the negative side of Greenwich Mean. Whatever the case, it is Boxing Day in Melbourne, and that means one thing. We are about to send 13 players and two umpires into the middle of the MCG to suffer in ridiculous heat all day. In Melbourne the temperature didn’t drop out of the 20s all night, it will be into the 30s by the time the toss takes place, and it will be up towards 40 degrees by the end of the afternoon. The following days will cool off. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure the ICC doesn’t have an extreme heat policy, even though the world is getting hotter. Cricket Australia does have one, where something called the Heat Stress Risk Index can be calculated to theoretically suspend games if it gets hot enough. But at this level of heat they usually just have extra drink breaks. So, on we go. Safe to say this is a bat-first day, even though the MCG has become the best bowling pitch in the country after they renovated it for being too flat."
"Go fetch a cup of tea and your best arguments, it’s time for the Guardian’s 10th annual men’s Test XI of the Year. This year’s selection panel comprised Vic Marks, Ali Martin, Emma John, Rob Smyth, Jonathan Liew, Adam Collins, Geoff Lemon, Daniel Gallan, Tim de Lisle, Taha Hashim, Tanya Aldred, Jim Wallace, and myself, Andy Bull. It’s been an intriguing 12 months, in which every team was able to beat someone but no team was able to beat everyone, and at the end of it, everyone picked their own XI and, when we added up the votes, this is how it all came out (and yes, we were surprised so many Englishmen ended up in it, too) … 1 Yashasvi Jaiswal 14 matches, 1,312 runs at 52. Votes: 13 out of 13 Over the course of England’s tour of India, Jaiswal established himself as one of the brightest batters of the next generation of Test cricketers, a point he proved when he ended the year by taking 161 off Australia in Perth. It wasn’t just the number of runs he scored, although they came by the hundred-weight, with back-to-back double centuries in Vizag and Rajkot, it was the irresistible ferocity of his batting. Jaiswal hit more sixes in the past 12 months of Test cricket than Virat Kohli has in 12 years of it. He was the only unanimous pick in this team. 2 Ben Duckett 16 matches, 1,065 at 35. Votes: 10 It was a rough 12 months for opening batters right around the world, and Duckett, as the former Wisden editor Tim de Lisle says, is a faute de mieux selection. Aside from Jaiswal, he was the only opener to make 1,000 runs in the year, or even get close to it. He scored two dashing centuries in games England lost, against India in Rajkot and Pakistan in Multan, and established himself as a senior member of the team, but his slightly flibbertigibbet habit of getting out without going on meant he finished the year with a middling average. 3 Joe Root 17 matches, 1,556 at 56 / 11 wickets at 51. Votes: 12 There’s an argument that Root is the best batter in the game right now, and an argument, too, that given what he’s achieved in his field, he may even be the most accomplished active sportsperson in the UK. Just don’t expect to hear him make it himself. Chastised for his impish dismissal trying to reverse‑scoop Jasprit Bumrah in India, he responded with a bloody-minded 122 off 274 balls in the next Test against them. It was the first of six centuries he scored against five different teams in four countries. In the space of six weeks of high summer, he scored twin tons against Sri Lanka at Lord’s and a career-best 262 against Pakistan. 4 Harry Brook 12 matches, 1,100 runs at 55. Votes: 11 You only ever needed to see Brook hit one inside-out cover drive to understand exactly how talented a batsman he is, but it’s been a joy to watch him make good on his potential this year, when his form has carried him right to the top of the International Cricket Council’s Test batting rankings. He skipped the tour of India for personal reasons, but spent the time getting himself in shape for the season ahead, and was rewarded for it with four hundreds, including the first triple century by an Englishman in more than 30 years. Root reckons he is “by far and away the best player in the world at the minute”. Next year’s series against India and Australia will show whether he is right about that. 5 Kamindu Mendis 9 matches, 881 runs at 66 / 3 wickets at 30. Votes: 8 Mendis spent most of his year propping up Sri Lanka from way down the order. He began with back-to-back scores of 102 and 92 not out against Bangladesh, and was better again on tour in England, where he made 113, 74 and 64 in successive Tests. He dominated a home series against New Zealand, when he made twin centuries, the second of them an unbeaten 182, which made him the series’ leading scorer by a country mile. He found it harder going on tour in South Africa, but still, by the end of the year his remarkable ability to bowl both right- and left-arm spin was just a footnote to the brilliance of his technically adept batting. 6 Travis Head 8 matches, 607 runs at 47 / 3 wickets at 26. Votes: 6 Head’s freewheeling batting was a bust more often than not – he was dismissed under 30 in eight of the 12 innings he played this year, and endured a run of 0, 0 and 1 across series against West Indies and New Zealand in the spring. But when it came off he broke some of the best Test bowling units. He took 119 off the sharp West Indian attack in January, and then made 89, 140, and 152 against India in December, the two centuries turning the course of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after Australia had been bowled out for 104 in their first innings of the series. About the only man who’s figured out a way to play Jasprit Bumrah. 7 Kyle Verreynne 7 matches 380 runs at 42, 20 catches, three stumpings. Votes: 4 So far as rookie mistakes go, taking the mickey out of the South African national team is right up there alongside starting a land war in Asia. The Proteas were derided for sending a third team to New Zealand so that their stars could stay at home and play Twenty20, and they responded, characteristically, with an unbeaten run of matches against West Indies, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka that put them top of the World Test Championship. Verreynne has been one of the driving forces behind their resurgence. He played a match-winning innings of 114 against Bangladesh in Mirpur, the only century of a Test, and the best of his career. 8 Ravindra Jadeja 11 matches, 508 runs at 32 / 44 wickets at 24. Votes: 6 At 36 Jadejas is a little older, a little greyer, and his bowling has lost just a little of its edge, but he was still irrepressible. When he wasn’t scoring runs, he was taking wickets; when he wasn’t taking wickets, he was scoring runs, and when he wasn’t doing either it was only because he was doing both. He had a star turn in India’s 434-run humiliation of England in Rajkot, when he scored a six-hour century and took seven-wickets, then he took 10 for 120, the second-best match figures of his career, against New Zealand at Mumbai. He finished the year with a crucial 77 to save the follow-on in a draw against Australia. 9 Gus Atkinson 11 matches, 52 wickets at 22 / 352 runs at 23. Votes: 8 A Boy’s Own summer. Atkinson has achieved so much so quickly that it’s easy to forget he couldn’t even get into the England team last winter, when he was the spare wheel in the seam attack. He made his debut in July, but he has already got 50 Test wickets, a 12-wicket haul against West Indies, a century against Sri Lanka and a hat-trick against New Zealand, too, after all of which there wasn’t a whole lot left for him to achieve in the sport. The greatest testament to him is that no one really felt the need to mention that England were missing Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. 10 Matt Henry 9 matches, 48 wickets at 19. Votes: 7 After eight years as a part of New Zealand’s supporting cast, Henry has finally earned a starring part as the leader of their Test attack. At 33, and with a decade spent honing his game in domestic leagues behind him, he was ready for it. He took 17 wickets at 15 runs each in two Tests against Australia in the spring, which won him player of the series in spite of New Zealand’s defeat, and he followed that with 13 wickets at only 12 runs each when they whitewashed India, including five for 15 in the first Test at Bengaluru. There haven’t been many men who have outbowled India’s own quicks in their home conditions, but Henry did. 11 Jasprit Bumrah 12 matches, 62 wickets at 14. Votes: 12 The leading cricketer in the world, Bumrah bookended his year with six for 61 against South Africa in Cape Town and six for 76 against Australia in Brisbane. In between, he did it to England too, when he took six for 45 in Vizag. The batsmen kept trying to persuade themselves, and everyone else, that despite his unorthodox action, Bumrah was just another fast bowler, vulnerable as any other, but so far no one has really done much to prove it’s actually true. He was the biggest difference between the teams in India’s home series over England, and, if he carries on in this sort of form, will be again in their away series against Australia.

"Front row The Lions are stronger in certain areas than others and much hinges, in every sense, on Ireland’s front row. No one would quibble hugely if an all-Irish triumvirate of Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong pack down for the first Test against the Wallabies in Brisbane on 19 July – but what if all three are not fully firing? The talented, athletic Sheehan is just back from a long-term layoff and injury forced Porter to withdraw from the last Lions tour to South Africa before the squad’s departure. The admirable Furlong, meanwhile, has already been hammering away on Test rugby’s frontline for a decade. It underlines the importance of strength in depth, with the Australia scrum much improved. Both Scotland props, Pierre Schoeman and Zander Fagerson, will fancy making the plane, as will the Wales hooker Dewi Lake (current injury permitting) and, depending on England’s Six Nations form, either Jamie George or Theo Dan. Ellis Genge and Nicky Smith are probably contesting the last loosehead vacancy, with Ireland’s Finlay Bealham, born in Australia, as the third tighthead. Second row The 2025 squad will not be stuffed full of returning Lions. It may even be that Furlong and Maro Itoje are the only starting forwards from 2021 to retain their Test places, making the latter’s experience even more important. Again the Six Nations will be instructive but, at this distance, Ireland’s Joe McCarthy and James Ryan are the two main frontrunners to partner Itoje. A decent lineout presence will be essential, with the ex-England lock Geoff Parling now shaping Australia’s strategy in that area, and McCarthy’s impact could be key. The other option involves moving the excellent Tadhg Beirne up from the back row, where Andy Farrell will be keen to start him, or opting for Wales’s hard‑working Dafydd Jenkins. Either way, another mobile and versatile lineout forward will be required, with Ireland’s talented Ryan Baird looking to edge out Ollie Chessum and the evergreen Courtney Lawes. Back row Perhaps the trickiest selection conundrum of the lot. Caelan Doris, Ireland’s captain, would make an excellent Lions skipper and the consistent Josh van der Flier is another shoo-in. Add Tadhg Beirne and that potentially leaves just four more squad vacancies. Only three from Jac Morgan, Ben Earl, Jack Willis, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Rory Darge look certain to make it, with Willis’s form for Toulouse so good he will be difficult to ignore. There is just one snag: if Toulouse make the Top 14 final on 28 June the Englishman will in effect be unavailable for the first three games of the tour. That, in turn, could mean him starting the first Test on the bench, with Morgan and Earl taking the early-tour strain. The final slot will be earmarked for a hard-carrying, dynamic No 8, with Aaron Wainwright, Jack Conan, Jack Dempsey, Chandler Cunningham‑South, Taulupe Faletau, Taine Plumtree and Tom Willis all candidates. Wainwright would boost Wales’s representation, while the ex-Wallaby Dempsey could bring useful inside knowledge. Half-backs No Lions tour succeeds without a smart, influential pair of half-backs. Jamison Gibson-Park has been at the heart of Ireland’s finest displays and England’s Alex Mitchell and Wales’s Tomos Williams are next in line, ahead of Ben White, George Horne and Ben Spencer. Fly-half? Think back to the last Test the Lions played in Australia, in Sydney in 2013, and Johnny Sexton’s influence when the chips were down. Whether or not Finn Russell is Andy Farrell’s idea of a perfect 10, both he and Marcus Smith add spark to any side. Either way – and allowing for Smith’s occasional redeployment at full-back – a third 10 with another positional string to his bow will be needed. Is that Owen Farrell, not currently playing Test rugby? Or might Scotland’s Tom Jordan, who can also play 15, be the answer? Ireland’s Sam Prendergast and Ciarán Frawley will hope otherwise. Midfield If a team’s strength is best gauged by the names omitted, the 2025 Lions will be impressively strong. Robbie Henshaw, Ollie Lawrence, Henry Slade and Cam Redpath are all seriously talented but limited preparation time and shorter tours make it harder to forge dream partnerships – Brian O’Driscoll and Jamie Roberts, for example, in South Africa in 2009. Step forward “Huw-ipolotu” – the Glasgow and Scotland pairing of Sione Tuipolotu and Huw Jones and the steely Irish combo of Bundee Aki and Garry Ringrose. With Russell at 10, the Scotland duo would be accustomed to their conductor’s rhythm. And if things need tightening up and pressure needs applying to the Wallabies’ playmakers then Aki and Ringrose are perfectly suited. If Owen Farrell is missing, though, someone else needs to be versatile enough to fill in at centre. Ireland’s Jamie Osborne is already a player whom Andy Farrell admires. Back three Blair Kinghorn’s form for Toulouse makes him favourite to start at full-back. As with the aforementioned Willis, though, Kinghorn will struggle to feature in the first three games if his club make the Top 14 final. That further complicates Farrell’s task and it could boil down to a couple of straight shootouts: Hugo Keenan or Osborne as reserve full-back and either Jordan or Henshaw in a utility back role. On the wings Manny Feyi-Waboso, Duhan van der Merwe and James Lowe, if fit, all have the pedigree and strike rate to merit squad selection but the Wallabies’ aerial prowess may count against the brilliant but diminutive Darcy Graham. Farrell may prefer the Canberra-born Mack Hansen, England’s Tommy Freeman or Wales’s Liam Williams. Possible British &amp; Irish Lions starting XV and bench for first Test v Australia, Brisbane, 19 July: Blair Kinghorn (Scotland); Manny Feyi-Waboso (England), Huw Jones (Scotland), Sione Tuipolotu (Scotland), Duhan van der Merwe (Scotland); Finn Russell (Scotland), Jamison Gibson-Park (Ireland); Andrew Porter (Ireland), Dan Sheehan (Ireland), Tadhg Furlong (Ireland), Maro Itoje (England), Joe McCarthy (Ireland), Tadhg Beirne (Ireland), Josh van der Flier (Ireland), Caelan Doris (Ireland, capt). Replacements: Dewi Lake (Wales), Pierre Schoeman (Scotland), Zander Fagerson (Scotland), James Ryan (Ireland), Ben Earl (England), Tomos Williams (Wales), Marcus Smith (England), Bundee Aki (Ireland). • This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

"Victoria Coren Mitchell is an author, broadcaster and former professional poker player and is married to the comedian David Mitchell. She started writing a weekly column for the Daily Telegraph aged 14, and has since published a number of books including For Richer, for Poorer: Confessions of a Poker Player (2009). Seasonal specials of the quiz show Only Connect, which she has presented since 2008, will be running on 30 Dec and 1-3 Jan at 8pm on BBC Two. Only Connect: The Difficult Second Quiz Book is out now. 1. DVD This Is Us Yes. DVD. Save your scorn for the next bit: we still have a VCR as well. And when we settle our little daughter into bed, we put on a nice CD of Puffin bedtime stories. (If that breaks, we arrange for a troupe of strolling minstrels to perform some up-to-the-minute pieces on the lute.) Anyway, we’re currently working through the American series This Is Us. Any plot summary might spoil the first, wonderful episode, so I’ll just recommend it very highly: this is truly great. The best TV I’ve seen since Our Friends in the North. 2. Theatre Goldilocks and the Three Bears As a “proper” play, I adored Laura Wade’s The Watsons, which has just finished at the Menier Chocolate Factory and will be in the West End next summer: it’s so funny and clever, original and delightful. But since it’s Christmas, my theatrical pick is the current show at the London Palladium. I hadn’t seen a proper panto for years and this has made me resolve to go every year. This one is vastly entertaining and all the cast are great, but Julian Clary is absolutely different class – a performance of genius. He plays a circus ringmaster. (He makes some jokes about this.) 3. Film Downton Abbey We rarely get out to the cinema these days and when we do, as fearful middle age sets in, it is preferable to see something that might have been on television anyway. What better than Downton, the drama so flexible that a whole episode could just as easily be about an aristocrat humping a Turk to death or a shortage of chairs for the village fete. The film was brilliantly performed by most of Britain’s favourite actors, and so relaxing that my husband got up halfway through, thinking he could put the kettle on. 4. Comedy Ben Elton Live 2019 Ben Elton does about 12 different things and all of them successfully, so it’s easy to think of him as a TV scriptwriter or a novelist or an author of stage musicals. He is all those things (as well as writing Upstart Crow, which David is doing on stage next year, just to save Twitter cynics from pointing that out for me) but watching his return to standup this autumn after a 15-year absence, I knew I was watching his most blazing vocation. It was so sharp, brave and helplessly funny, I can’t swear it wasn’t the greatest thing I’ve ever seen on stage in any medium. 5. Museum Discover Story Centre in Stratford, east London In some ways, this children’s museum is very London. You come out of the tube, cross a vast polluted road, pass the tent city of freezing homeless people and you’re there. But in other ways it’s not like London at all: it’s got a lot of space (two big floors of book-themed adventure and play areas, plus a sizable garden) and it’s reasonably priced: £6.50 before concessions and £0-£1.50 for special exhibitions. I only just found out about it; our four-year-old loved it and I’ll now be taking her there a lot. 6. Poetry The Skunk by Seamus Heaney I’ve been going to a reading group at our local library, run by the Royal Literary Fund. (My life is so respectable now, I’m starting to wonder if I really did spend 20 years gambling and chain-smoking or if I only dreamed it.) Anyway, the great thing about this group is they do short pieces rather than whole books, so you can actually get somewhere in a discussion. The people are so eclectic, it’s like doing jury service. We take strange routes to a hopefully correct reading. I didn’t like this poem on first look, but by the end of the hour I realised it’s terrific."
"William Blake always dreamed of making vast works for churches and palaces but to his bitter disappointment he never achieved it. More than two centuries after his death Tate has announced it is going some way to making up for that by projecting his final work on to the giant dome of St Paul’s Cathedral. For four evenings from Thursday, his illustration, Ancient of Days, will dramatically light up the skyline of London. Martin Myrone, the senior curator of pre-1800 art at Tate Britain, said Blake always had grand ambitions as an artist, proposing huge frescoes that were never realised. “Everything that survives of his work is very small. Many of his works are just a few inches high,” he said. “What he said he wanted to do was produce altarpieces and large-scale pictorial schemes in churches and palaces. This is a moment to realise a version at least of that lifelong dream of Blake’s to be an artist with real public impact who was being seen on a large scale.” Blake is regarded as a visionary, radical artist who was ahead of his time and unappreciated for most of his life. “He had a frustrating career and had moments when he was really down and depressed,” said Myrone. “He felt alienated from the art establishment and he never really won the audience that he wished to have. “He did see himself as an artist who should be read and seen by not just a few connoisseurs but by lots and lots of people.” The project, which marks his birthday, stems from Tate Britain’s current exhibition of Blake, the biggest for a generation, which runs until February and includes digital enlargements of works he imagined as vast frescoes on public buildings. The St Paul’s dome takes it to another level and is an appropriate venue because it is home to a memorial to Blake. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in Bunhill Fields burial ground near Old Street in London. Myrone said Blake was a contrary, argumentative person. “I think he would hopefully recognise that we are acknowledging him not as an easy figure but as a major presence in British cultural life.”"
"Bedecked in gold lamé and baubles, Julian Clary is firmly established as a Christmas beacon at the London Palladium. In this, Clary’s fourth pantomime season at the prestigious venue, he has effectively become a permanent fixture: his face has just gone up on the theatre’s “wall of fame”, alongside stars such as Judy Garland and Ken Dodd. But the performer and author, a man infamous for over-sharing for comic effect on stage, still has a few secrets hiding under his outlandish costume as the Ringmaster in Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Not only is Clary soon to play a serious theatrical role, starring opposite Matthew Kelly in a touring production of Ronald Harwood’s esteemed drama The Dresser, he has also written a stage show of his own, based on his successful series of children’s books, The Bolds. “I find as I get older I’ve got to challenge myself, otherwise life gets too easy,” Clary told the Observer. “I could get bored if I didn’t keep doing different things. So I like saying to myself, ‘I wonder if I could do that?’ and then throwing down the gauntlet. It is not to do with bravery; it is just to do with stimulating myself.” The five-week run of Goldilocks, in which Clary co-stars with Gary Wilmot, Paul Zerdin, Paul O’Grady and Nigel Havers, forms a break in a big national tour of his one-man stand-up show, Born to Mince, which resumes in April. “I did my tour, then I wrote the latest Bolds book over the summer, finishing it about a week before I started work on the panto,” said Clary. “I just compartmentalise. My brain couldn’t cope with it any other way, because they are such different activities. And I like the contrast. I like being applauded on stage, but I also like being locked away at home using a different part of the brain – my inner life and all that sort of carry-on.” Perhaps the pantomime star’s most surprising admission, however, is that he does not much like Christmas. A bonus of appearing in Goldilocks is that Clary, 60, is permanently unavailable for seasonal socialising. “Panto is really physically tiring because it means 12 shows a week,” he said. “But then I don’t have to go to Christmas parties because I am busy. I don’t like them because you have to be nice to people and smile all the time. “I also like doing panto at such a grim, wintry time of year. You are in this magical world on stage for the run and, by the time you have finished, and perhaps had a holiday, then spring is on the way. And the show is at the Palladium, so that is endlessly thrilling. And I do get to sleep in my own bed, unlike touring.” News that Clary’s image was to be ensconced on the theatre’s wall of fame came in the form of a “posh-looking” letter from the theatre’s owner, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and his wife Madeleine Gurdon. “It is just a lovely thing,” said Clary. “I am up there next to Shirley Bassey and near Norman Wisdom. Cilla Black and Jimmy Tarbuck are there too. I can’t believe my luck just working here, to be honest.” Clary’s outrageous costumes are a key element of the panto, and this year they are bigger than ever. Yet the brunt of the hard work, he said, is borne off-stage by his dressers. “It is the putting them on and off me that is the difficult part,” he said. “They have to hoik them on to my shoulders and I just have to stagger on to the stage, take the applause, say a few lines and go off. It’s easy.” This year he is also surreptitiously studying his dresser, in preparation for playing one in Harwood’s play. “I spend all day with my dresser because if I am not on stage I am getting changed and so, yes, whether you want it or not, you have some sort of relationship going on. They have to make my dinner and say nice things to me, as well as change my shoes.” The Dresser opens in August next year, so it “is not yet keeping me awake”, Clary said. “It is a play I love, and one that I thought maybe I could do – something I can get my teeth into. It is funny – and I do like making people laugh – but it is also very sad.” Live theatre, Clary suspects, remains in demand, despite the growing attraction of on-screen entertainment. “Theatre is totally absorbing and transporting, whereas watching something on the screen isn’t for me,” he said. “It is escapism, and that is what people need.” And those performers who can offer audiences some extravagant fun are at a premium, Clary believes. “Oh yes, people are clamouring for it. Particularly a show like Goldilocks that is just nonsense. It is lavish and spectacular, and so much work has gone into it, but it is lightweight. That is what I like about it.” Young readers of his books can expect something a little tamer than the full-on stage persona when Clary makes a personal appearance for his publisher, Penguin. “I know to be careful. I can multi-task,” he said. “When I am reading a story, if some of the parents titter, then so be it. There is a character called Roger the Sheep, and if you want to see innuendo in Roger the Sheep, then you can. It is entirely up to you, and the children don’t see it, hopefully.” Clary’s growing “multitasking” career may be a joy to him, but he knows it is hard work for his agents. “There is a literary agent, a comedy agent and an acting agent and they all have to stay in touch. But that is their problem, not mine. I don’t see why I have to pick just one occupation. It is like being a field; I just rotate and then lie fallow for a while.” Goldilocks and the Three Bears is at the London Palladium until 12 January 2020. The Dresser will go on tour from September"
"The British Museum has unveiled a year-long programme of events to mark the 850th anniversary of the murder of Thomas Becket. The archbishop of Canterbury was murdered on 29 December 1170 in what the museum described as “one of the most shocking crimes in European history”. The programme for Becket 2020 includes performances, talks, film screenings and religious services. The year of events will culminate with a major exhibition about Becket, which will open at the British Museum in October. Naomi Speakman, the exhibition’s co-curator, said: “The story of Thomas Becket’s life, death and legacy has all the hallmarks of a Game of Thrones plot. There’s drama, fame, royalty, power, envy, retribution and ultimately a brutal murder that shocked Europe. “These events had repercussions that have echoed out through time and we’re delighted to be telling this important story for the first time in a major exhibition.” Becket was killed in Canterbury Cathedral by four knights after what was interpreted as an order from King Henry II. Becket was made a saint by the Pope just over two years later and his shrine in Canterbury became a destination for pilgrims from across Europe before it was destroyed on the orders of Henry VIII in the early years of the Reformation. The British Museum said its exhibition, the title of which has not been decided, would present “Becket’s tumultuous journey: from London merchant’s son to archbishop; and from a revered saint in death to a traitor in the eyes of Henry VIII over 350 years later”. It will showcase more than 100 objects associated with the archbishop, including manuscripts, jewellery, sculpture, stained glass and paintings. The exhibition will include loans from around the world, as well as artefacts from the museum’s collection. The programme of events will include a new production of TS Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral, a verse drama that depicts the assassination, performed in Canterbury Cathedral, as part of an initiative with the Marlowe Theatre in October. The cathedral will stage a choral evensong service to commemorate Becket’s martyrdom on 29 December 2020."
"30. United Together (1980) In one sense, United Together is symbolic of what went wrong with Franklin’s career in the early 80s – it’s a high-gloss MOR ballad, a world away from the music that made her name. But you can’t get away from the fact that she sounds amazing, investing the lyric with undeniable power. 29. Holdin’ On (2003) Her last album (after 23 years) on Arista, So Damn Happy made more concessions to Franklin’s past than its immediate predecessors: she played piano, wrote material and sounded more comfortable in her surroundings. You can hear it on Holdin’ On, co-written and arranged by Mary J Blige, proof that her vocal ability was undiminished in her 60s. 28. Freeway of Love (1985) Laden with guest appearances, home to Sisters Are Doing It for Themselves, 1985’s Who’s Zoomin’ Who restored Franklin to the charts. The album’s production is very of its era: the 60s Motown pastiche Freeway of Love was remixed to appeal to “rock” – ie white – audiences. But it’s such a fantastic song, it hardly matters: Franklin, meanwhile, sounds exuberant. 27. It’s Gonna Get a Bit Better (1979) Her audience seemed to think Franklin was lowering herself by making the disco album La Diva, but the reality is far better than its wretched reputation suggests, as evidenced by her version of this Lalomie Washburn song, far too funky and robust to feel like belated bandwagon-jumping. 26. Something He Can Feel (1976) The Curtis Mayfield-helmed soundtrack to the film Sparkle is an overlooked gem in Franklin’s catalogue, his songs great, the lush proto-disco sound a delight. Something He Can Feel was supposed to be part of the repertoire of the 60s girl group at the heart of the film, but it’s too well-written and subtle to sound like pastiche. 25. I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You) (1967) Finally allowed, by her new label Atlantic, to do whatever she wanted – “They just told me to sit at the piano and sing” – Franklin responded with the title track of her 10th album, a blues into which she appeared to pour all the pain of her marriage to the appalling Ted White. 24. A Rose Is Still a Rose (1998) The late 90s attempt to give Franklin a hip-hop/neo soul-influenced makeover didn’t really work, except on the album’s Lauryn Hill-penned title track. The beat and the lyrical references to “flossin’” are contemporary, but the singer sounds unfazed, delivering a coolly controlled performance. 23. Every Girl (Wants My Guy) (1983) Franklin’s early-80s albums don’t get a lot of love. They are certainly not unimpeachable classics to match her late 60s/early 70s imperial period, but they’re still studded with gems. From the Luther Vandross-produced LP Get It Right, Every Girl (Wants My Guy) is a fabulously sassy slice of post-disco boogie. 22. Soulville (1964) Columbia Records knew Franklin was talented, but not what to do with her, peppering her career with false starts. Occasionally, however, her full power was unleashed, as here. A frantic take on Dinah Washington’s 1963 hit, this is more edgy and exciting than the MOR and jazz-pop the label usually lumbered her with. 21. Night Life (1967) Franklin completely inhabits Willie Nelson’s song about his early career, struggling at the bottom of Nashville’s ladder. The backing perfectly conjures up a dingy club at 3am, her performance switching between weariness and a weird kind of relish: “The night life ain’t no good life, but you know it’s my life.” 20. A Deeper Love (1992) Franklin’s great excursion into house music – produced by Clivillés and Cole of C&amp;C Music Factory fame – features a typically amazing vocal over the relentless height-of-the-night groove. Picking up on the religious undercurrent of the lyrics, she shifts from scat singing to fervent gospel sermonising; its full power is revealed on the a capella intro of C&amp;C’s Deeper Mix. 19. Young, Gifted and Black (1972) Franklin was advised against taking on Nina Simone’s black power anthem. It was the organist Billy Preston who piped up that Franklin could “crush it”, and he was right: she took the intro to church, extending it until it consumed half the song, smoothing out Simone’s staccato performance until it sounded exultant. 18. Sweet Bitter Love (1985) Amid Who’s Zoomin’ Who’s MTV-friendly sheen lurks a version of a Van McCoy ballad that Franklin had originally recorded in the 60s. If the new take isn’t as great as the rough demo, her vocal is still wonderful, the track itself a powerful link to her roots in the teeth of her 80s pop phase. 17. Chain of Fools (1967) A song based entirely around one chord, Chain of Fools is really audacious. It should in theory be a monotonal dirge, but Franklin’s soaring vocal and the tight mesh of guitar interplay between Joe South and Jimmy Johnson makes it hugely compelling. Moreover, she arranged it herself, uncredited. 16. Mr DJ (5 for the DJ) (1975) Her album You is usually pinpointed as the moment when Franklin’s creativity stalled. In terms of material, it’s not a patch on the previous year’s Let Me in Your Life, but the opening track Mr DJ is magic, a horn and call-and-response vocal-laden strut that defies anyone in earshot not to dance. 15. Do Right Woman, Do Right Man (1967) The sessions for Franklin’s first Atlantic album were stormy; at one point they had to be abandoned after a row involving Ted Wright, leaving Do Right Woman, Do Right Man unfinished. Later, Franklin completed the song in one take. It’s tempting to say you can tell: her performance is calm but firm, precise and commanding. 14. The Weight (1969) Perhaps the greatest of Franklin’s unfailingly brilliant reworkings of contemporary rock material – see also her versions of Bridge Over Troubled Water and Elton John’s Border Song – her take on The Band’s The Weight is tender country soul, with a gospel vocal that belies Franklin’s claim she had no idea what the lyrics were about. 13. Drown in My Own Tears (1967) Even by Franklin’s standards, the vocal on Drown in My Own Tears is exceptional, a summoning of pain and inconsolable misery that gradually gains momentum until it reaches a startling peak of desperation three minutes in as she repeatedly wails the word “drown” in a manner that is genuinely chilling. 12. I Say a Little Prayer (1968) Not for the first time, Franklin took someone else’s hit – a recent million-seller for Dionne Warwick – and made it utterly her own. Initially released as a B-side, her version was far tougher, lacked the easy-listening orchestration of the original and was subsequently acclaimed by one-half of its writing team, Burt Bacharach, as the definitive reading. 11. Call Me (1970) Call Me was the only Franklin original on 1970’s This Girl’s in Love With You, but what an original: her piano playing pitched between soul and jazz, a pillowy – but not schmaltzy – orchestral arrangement by Arif Mardin, a vocal filled with longing and bruised optimism. 10. What Y’All Came to Do (2007) Franklin’s final decade saw some incredible live performances – not least at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors – but, as she was beset by ill-health, her recorded output was patchy. Recorded as a contractual obligation, this duet with John Legend unexpectedly turned out triumphant: upfront, wildly funky, the best thing she had done in 20 years. 9. Until You Come Back to Me (That’s What I’m Gonna Do) (1974) Her sister Erma lauded Franklin’s ability to “transform extreme pain to extreme beauty”, which is exactly what happens on this Stevie Wonder co-write. The song is about romantic obsession, but Franklin turns it into something transcendent and enraptured, her voice soft, the backing warm and alluring. 8. Angel (1973) The combination of Franklin and Quincy Jones should have been triumphant, but 1973’s Hey Now Hey fell some way short of expectation. If it had all been as a great as Angel, it would have been a different story. Everything about the song is sublime, from the silky arrangement to Franklin’s emotional shift from vulnerability to resolution. 7. Day Dreaming (1972) Apparently about Franklin’s affair with the Temptations singer Dennis Edwards, Day Dreaming is a fabulous piece of music. Languid and sexy, its wistful mood is ramped up by Donny Hathaway’s otherworldly electric piano, the scattered, abstract bursts of flute and a lengthy, slightly eerie beat-less outro. 6. Spirit in the Dark (1970) The battle between the sacred and the profane that lurked at the heart of soul music was captured on the self-penned title track of Franklin’s 17th studio album, later sampled by Kanye West. Beautiful and episodic, Spirit in the Dark’s sound is pure gospel, but the lyrics imply more earthly pleasures. 5. Think (1968) Ostensibly a song about a relationship that has descended into gaslighting, Think seems to be driven by something else entirely. Recorded a week after Franklin sang at Martin Luther King’s funeral, the repeated cry of “Freedom!” and the demand for listeners to “let yourself be free” clearly had other resonances, giving the song a fraught power and impact. 4. You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman (1967) When Frankin’s star finally rose, it did so at a startling speed. Four months after Respect hit, a songwriting team as respected as Goffin and King were writing material just for her. Fifty years on, over-familiarity hasn’t blunted the impact of her performance: the way she shifts from the control of the verses to the euphoria of the chorus still sounds sublime. 3. Rock Steady (1972) Initially at least, Franklin seemed imperiously capable of assimilating any new musical trend into her sound, as demonstrated by the self-penned Rock Steady, her killer response to funk. It’s an exquisite tight-but-slinky groove, with a fabulous bassline, a vocal that manages to be raw but perfectly controlled and an addictive call-and-response chorus. 2. Amazing Grace (1972) In reality, you could pick anything from 1972’s Amazing Grace, the double live gospel set that contains the most extraordinary vocal performances of Franklin’s career. But the title track might just be the most extraordinary of the lot, a display of potent, intuitive, shiver-inducing extemporisation that lasts for 10 minutes, without a second wasted. 1. Respect (1967) It wasn’t just that Franklin’s version of Respect was simultaneously tougher and catchier than Otis Redding’s original – the “Sock it to me” refrain and “R-E-S-P-E-C-T” hook were Franklin’s additions – or that the song helped catapult her to stardom. It was that her performance completely changed the song’s meaning, from a man demanding fealty from his wife to an assertive, ballsy demand for equality that could have been applied to women’s rights or black power, in the process helping to shift soul music into a new era when social consciousness blended with commerciality, an impossibly potent combination. “The girl has taken that song from me,” noted Redding, sagely. “From now on, it belongs to her.”"
"The artist known as “What” was not prepared to be awarded Australia’s richest art prize. When his grammatically confounding name was called – it is not really a pseudonym, as his partner, his friends and even his parents call him “What” – the artist appeared stunned. A space opened up around him. Camera shutters snapped wildly. His partner, who had accompanied him to the event, burst into tears. What, who is supremely difficult to Google, has previously been a finalist in the Wynne, Sulman and Doug Moran prizes. His painting of Go-Betweens frontman Robert Forster was chosen from nearly 1,000 entrants and awarded the $150,000 Doug Moran portrait prize at Juniper Hall in Sydney on Wednesday morning. “That’s highly unexpected,” said the artist when his win was announced. “That is a life changing sum [of money].” “This is the third time I’ve painted Robert,” he said. “Robert was so important to me as a baby artist in Australia. Great music. Wearing lipstick, wearing dresses.” The Doug Moran prize is awarded to an original work from an Australian artist of an Australian subject, painted at least partly from life. This year the judging panel was comprised of artist and 2013 prize-winner Nigel Milsom; Kelly Gellatly, director of the Ian Potter Museum of Art at the University of Melbourne; and Peter Moran, whose parents Greta and Doug Moran established the Moran Arts Foundation in 1988. What’s painting, a multicoloured work shimmering with a synaesthetic sensibility, shows Forster floating, vibrant and kaleidoscopic, amid a white space. His depiction of Forster was described by the judges as “[embodying] the endless possibilities of portraiture and painting”. “[It] is intriguing for its lack of solid form, and for the way in which the subject hovers on the canvas like a vibrating aura,” wrote Gellatly and Milsom. “He is like a technicolour apparition; neither concrete shape nor exact likeness.” The artist notes that accompany the artwork read: “I picked Robert up in my SAAB 900. He understood the car, I made him a pour over coffee. Robert played my concert classical guitar, out of tune. He loved the tuning. He was thinking about the guitar. And the coffee. And the SAAB. I put the brush down when I saw Robert in tune.” This is not What’s first portrait of Forster: the artist was a finalist in the 2017 Archibald prize for another. “Looking at Robert Forster I see / Six-foot-three of absorbency /Electric literary guitar / Red-hot Brisbane bricks / And French ultramarine stovepipes / Shaping rhythmic legs,” the description for that work read. “I am actually a musician as well, I’m a classical guitarist,” What told Guardian Australia. “But back when I was a teenager I was into rock and roll.” Forster was doing in Australia in the 70s and 80s what the artist loved in bands like the Smiths and the Cure in the UK. “I’ve followed his career ever since and he’s just such a great person to paint. So tall, beautiful and a gentleman,” the artist said. “I think that picture has a sense of joy.” In person, What was a tall, slender figure in RM Williams boots, and an unassuming grey linen jacket over a fuchsia shirt, hiding an infectious laugh and charming smile underneath a bushy grey beard. A practicing artist for 30 years, he refused to reveal his legal name, saying his nom-de-plume has “a certain mystery to it which I like to maintain”. “There’s not enough mysteries in the world. I’m not on Instagram, I like to keep a fairly low profile, and don’t like to tell the world everything that I’m doing and thinking. That’s what my painting is for,” he said. Art by What features in a number of public collections, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales and National Gallery of Australia. Interested parties can seek out information about his work and forthcoming exhibitions at Blockprojects gallery in Melbourne, by whom he is represented. Finalists in this year’s Doug Moran prize include a swathe of emerging artists, who are openly encouraged to enter, alongside established practitioners such as Yvette Coppersmith, Anthony Lister, Rodney Pople and Michael Zavros. Each of the finalists will receive $1,000. Sitters include ordinary members of the public as well as those with a public profile. Portraits of actor Barry Otto, Sigrid Thornton and Noah Taylor, and the late former prime minister Bob Hawke, were among those shortlisted this year. All 30 finalists of the Doug Moran, including the winner, will be on show to the public for free in Juniper Hall’s Georgian-era surrounds from Friday."
"The writer and broadcaster Clive James, who has died aged 80, once wrote a poem about visiting his father’s grave at the Sai Wan war cemetery in Hong Kong. His father, Albert, who had survived a PoW camp and then forced labour in Japan, died when the plane bringing him home crashed in Taiwan, and James later described this as the “defining event” in his life. The poem, My Father Before Me, ends: Back at the gate, I turn to face the hill, Your headstone lost again among the rest. I have no time to waste, much less to kill. My life is yours; my curse, to be so blessed. James, who was six when Albert died, spent much of his subsequent life as a poet, essayist and broadcaster producing articles and song lyrics, many poetry collections and volumes of critical essays, four novels and five books of memoirs, as well as hosting umpteen television shows. That fever of busyness was to compensate not only for his father’s death, but for how his mother’s life fell apart on being widowed. “I am trying to lead the life they might have had,” he said in 2009. “It’s a chance to pay them back for my life. I don’t like luck; I’ve had a lot of it.” James was born in Kogarah, a suburb of Sydney, Australia. His mother, Minora (nee Darke), named her only child Vivian, after the male star of the 1938 Australian Davis cup team. It could have been worse. There was, James noted in Unreliable Memoirs (1979), a famous Australian boy whose father named him after his campaigns across the Western Desert: he was called William Bardia Escarpment Qattara Depression Mersa Matruh El Alamein Benghazi Tripoli Harris. Vivian James was spared further feminisation when Gone With the Wind was released. “After Vivien Leigh played Scarlett O’Hara, the name became irrevocably a girl’s name no matter how you spelled it,” he wrote, so his mother let him become Clive after a character in a Tyrone Power movie. A bright child with an IQ of 140, James went to Sydney technical high school, and studied psychology at the University of Sydney. While there he was not only literary editor on the student paper, Honi Soit, and director of the student revue, but also took part in the Sydney Push, a libertarian, intellectual subculture that flourished in pub back rooms and whose associates included Germaine Greer and Robert Hughes. After graduating, he served for a year as an assistant editor of the magazine page at the Sydney Morning Herald before sailing to London at the age of 22. There, he shared a flat with the Australian film director Bruce Beresford, became friendly with Barry Humphries and spent three years paying the rent as a sheet-metal worker, library assistant, photo archivist and market researcher. He then studied for a further degree in English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, but did not read the required books. Instead, he became president of Footlights and established himself as a critic. “Reading off the course was in my nature. My style was to read everything except what mattered.” He nonetheless surprised himself by getting a 2:1, and began a PhD on Shelley. But the lure of literary London proved stronger. His byline soon appeared in the Listener, the New Statesman and other periodicals. In a self-penned obituary that he later included on his website, he wrote: “Clive James rapidly established himself as one of the most influential metropolitan critics of his generation ... The Observer hired him as a television reviewer in 1972, and for 10 years his weekly column was one of the most famous regular features in Fleet Street journalism, setting a style that was later widely copied.” All this makes him sound insufferable, but he was read not as a literary titan, nor as a revolutionary newspaper critic, but as something more cherishable: a funny guy. He could eviscerate a subject with a few well-chosen words. Arnold Schwarzenegger was “a brown condom full of walnuts”. Barbara Cartland’s eyes looked “like the corpses of two crows that had flown into a chalk cliff”. He also skewered others’ literary pretensions, if not his own: “Rilke used to say that no poet would mind going to jail, since he would at least have time to explore the treasure house of his memory. In many respects Rilke was a prick.” Publicity for his books often warned that the contents should not be read in public “unless you are unselfconscious about shrieking and snorting in public”. A lot of people snorted and shrieked, in public and otherwise, over his collected TV criticism Visions Before Midnight (1977), The Crystal Bucket (1981) and Glued to the Box (1983), as well as his five volumes of memoirs – if not his collections of literary journalism or his many books of poetry. He planned a sixth and last volume of memoirs, “the final chapter of which”, he told one interviewer, “will be dictated while I have an oxygen tent over my head. I wouldn’t like to spare the public my conclusions.” James became, then, a paradox: at once a high-minded litterateur who taught himself Russian because he “could no longer bear not to know something about how Pushkin sounded” and an avuncular TV bloke known for showing us clips of sadistic Japanese game shows. He came not to praise telly, nor to bury it like some fastidious antipodean approximation of George Steiner, but rather to revel in its absurdity, vulgarity and occasional charm. He was once described as “a bald Australian Chris Tarrant, [who would] sit there smirking in a blue suit several sizes too small, while half-naked contestants were pelted with scorpions and dangled above snake pits”. Perhaps so, but that was the winning format for such shows as Clive James on Television (1982-97, ITV), Saturday Night Clive (1989–90, BBC) and others. He also fronted travel programmes (including Clive James Live in Las Vegas, 1982, for ITV, and Clive James’ Postcard from Miami, 1990, for the BBC), was one of the first critics on BBC Two’s The Late Show, and hosted shows about Formula One. “Television brought James the riches and fame he craved,” wrote one hostile critic. “But as far as his ambitions to have been an artist of merit are concerned, he squandered his talent, which is tragic.” Unfair: there was never a sense in which he sought riches, nor was his case tragic. There is an image of him going home after a show by tube, reading Tacitus in the original, which suggests that, rather than tragic, James was interestingly conflicted – or perhaps just culturally omnivorous. In any case, the man who made a TV series analysing the concept of fame knew what it took for a bald man with eyes so deep-socketed they were scarcely visible to have an enduring on-screen career. “The smartest move I ever made in show business was to start off looking like the kind of wreck I would end up as.” Some made great claims for his literary talents. Writing under the headline As Good as Heaney in 2009, Julian Gough in Prospect magazine championed two volumes of James’s collected verse. But how could one take seriously a TV critic who wrote satirical verse epics such as The Fate of Felicity Fark in the Land of the Media: A Moral Poem (1975) or Peregrine Prykke’s Pilgrimage Through the London Literary World (1976), still less compare them to the Nobel laureate’s? Gough argued: “James is an absolute master of surface, and the great critic of surfaces, not because he is superficial but because he believes that the distortions on the surface tell you what’s underneath. Style is character. His simplicity isn’t simple and his clarity has depth. With the essays and the poems – which I think you have to consider as one great project – he’s built an immense, protective barrier reef around western civilisation.” Perhaps. But questions remained. Would Endurance, the Japanese game show in which contestants were buried up to the neck, bitten by ants and licked by lizards and upon which James spent so much tittering airtime, be inside that protective barrier reef? And, more importantly, was James a highbrow hypocritically conniving at what he affected to disdain? Probably not. He wrote in the introduction to Glued to the Box: “Anyone afraid of what he thinks television does to the world is probably just afraid of the world.” James claimed to have an “ungovernable ego” but was quite capable of uxoriousness. He was married to Prue Shaw, a Cambridge scholar, with whom he had two daughters: Claerwen and Lucinda. James protected all three from media intrusion, though he gave an insight into his admiration for his wife when he produced her book on Dante for an interviewer: “That’s the real McCoy. That will always be there. The kind of stuff I do is more conjectural. I am still trying to impress her.” He once said: “I think marriage civilised me. It may sound sexist, but it is one of the roles of women to civilise men.” He betrayed his wife by having an eight-year affair with a former model, Leanne Edelsten. When Shaw discovered the affair, in 2012, she threw him out of their Cambridge home, and he moved to a London flat. “I am a reprehensible character,” he told one interviewer. “I deserve everything that has happened to me.” His mainstream TV career ended with the 20th century, but James was not done. He set up clivejames.com, billing it “the world’s first personal multimedia website of its type”. He did an internet show, Talking in the Library, including conversations with Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Terry Gilliam. He reviewed widely for the New York Review of Books, the London Review of Books, the TLS, the New Yorker, the Australian Book Review and the Guardian, and wrote Cultural Amnesia (2007), a collection of biographical essays on mainly 20th century writers, artists and politicians. He made 60 broadcasts for the BBC Radio 4 series A Point of View (2007-09) and in 2008 performed two comedy shows at the Edinburgh festival. In his later years he worked harder than ever. He told one interviewer: “You get into what my friend Bruce Beresford calls the Departure Lounge, and two things happen: suddenly time really matters, you can hear the clock, and also you have all these freedoms, because you’ve got more of life to reflect on.” In January 2010, he was diagnosed with terminal leukaemia. One of the greatest annoyances his cancer and its treatment caused him was that he was not allowed to fly – thus stopping him visiting his beloved homeland. But he kept writing, including a weekly TV review for the Daily Telegraph for three years until 2014. An Indian summer of writing was just beginning, long after the valedictory interviews were done. He wrote a translation of Dante’s The Divine Comedy (2013), a collection of essays, Poetry Notebook: 2006-2014 (2014) and an analysis of the radical change in TV viewing habits, Play All: A Bingewatcher’s Notebook (2016). In 2015, he published a volume of poetry, Sentenced to Life, that expressed the loss and guilt he felt for his infidelity and betrayal of his wife and daughters. This book and the Dante translation became bestsellers, and both were dedicated to Prue, with whom he had reached a reconciliation. In the poem Landfall he wrote, “I am restored by my decline / And by the harsh awakening it brings”. The poem Event Horizon ends with the following reflection: What is it worth, then, this insane last phase When everything about you goes downhill? This much: you get to see the cosmos blaze And feel its grandeur, even against your will, As it reminds you, just by being there, That it is here we live, or else nowhere. That year he published a further collection of literary essays, Latest Readings (dedicated to “my doctors and nurses at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge”) and found a new berth as a columnist, with Reports of My Death, in the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, which ran until 2017. He also released an album with his longtime songwriting partner Pete Atkin, The Colours of the Night, and went on to produce another poetry collection, Injury Time (2017) as well as the epic poem The River in the Sky (2018). He was appointed CBE in 2012 and AO in 2013. In 2008 he was awarded a George Orwell special prize for writing and broadcasting, and in 2015 he received a special award from Bafta for his contribution to television. He is survived by his wife and daughters. • Clive Vivian Leopold James, writer and television presenter, born 7 October 1939; died 24 November 2019"
"David asked me to marry him years ago. Back then, a civil partnership was the only option. It had been introduced by Tony Blair in 2004; I was always surprised, given the size of his majority, that he didn’t introduce gay marriage instead. But we didn’t rush down that route: we knew that marriage would one day be an option. I had taken our two sons to the House of Commons on 5 February 2013, as MPs voted 400 to 175 in favour of introducing marriage equality. We wanted them to be part of it; they’d been on Pride marches with us, but this was a great opportunity to celebrate our progress. In December 2013, the date that ceremonies could take place was announced: 29 March 2014. I started calling councils close to where we live in London to find a licensed venue. Someone had to be the first, or one of the first, gay couples to marry that night and I didn’t want that honour to go to anyone else. I’m an activist, and aside from the personal side of things, I wanted to be part of that broader progress. The day itself was flipped upside down: we had our reception first, at 9pm on 28 March, at Islington town hall, with champagne and canapes. It was a huge rush as we were busy with life, work and family: I wore an old suit that didn’t fit as I’d lost weight in the run-up to the day, and hadn’t ironed my shirt. The personal part of the ceremony started at 11.30pm, in the same building. We had 100 guests, friends and family, and our sons’ school friends. The registrar wasn’t allowed in the room until midnight, for the legal ceremony – so we wanted them to use the shortest possible form of words. Afterwards, there were lots of cheers and hugs. We went outside around 12.20am, where there were a lot of people, cameras and press, waiting. The kids were inside, watching through a window. We discovered months later that they had been filming us, and talking about it, in the background; it’s one of our happiest memories of the night. My mum took them to a nearby hotel to go to bed, and David and I were whisked away by friends in a large limo to a gay club in Soho that was under threat of demolition. At the end of the night, around 4am, we went back to the town hall to clean up, as the room had to be ready for the next people. Afterwards, we were so tired we went home to crash for a few hours, completely forgetting we were booked into a hotel. The following day we had a big brunch, and then hosted our main wedding reception – held in the Strangers’ Dining Room at the Palace of Westminster. It was the height of David Cameron’s austerity measures, and he had opened up the palace to outside bookings. Same-sex marriage had followed a gradual progression of LGBTQ rights. Does society follow legislation, or is it the other way round? The law was certainly not keeping up with societal changes. But gay marriage has brought a greater societal shift in the way we view gay relationships; in the eyes of some, it has legitimised them. Marriage hasn’t changed our own relationship. I wear a wedding band, and thought I would feel self-conscious – a lot of people assume I have a wife – but I don’t. This isn’t the end of LGBTQ struggles. But it is progress. Marriage may be a flawed institution, but equality does matter. • As told to Hannah Booth If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."
"Stephen Colbert On Thursday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed the day’s big news out of Washington: the House vote to formalize the impeachment process against Donald Trump, which means America is “one step closer to getting Trump out of the White House”. The resolution passed 232-196, led by Colbert’s guest of the evening, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. No Republicans supported the measure, leaving Colbert to wonder: “Are they just complaining about process with those zero votes? Or are they really so lacking any honor that they are willing to publicly state that blackmailing a foreign government to interfere in our election is OK?” Earlier Thursday, a reporter asked House Republicans, led by the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, if they were willing to go on the record that the president did nothing inappropriate. “Very clear, yes,” McCarthy answered. Colbert had a follow-up question: “The Titanic just hit an iceberg; the captain is saying, ‘It was a perfect iceberg, now we can make all the Slurpees for everyone,’ and he’s asking you all to handcuff yourself to the port side rail and swallow the keys. Are you all willing to do that?” “Very clear, yes,” McCarthy says in the replayed clip. “Good to know,” Colbert nodded. The Republican congressmen who vehemently opposed the impeachment process vote “have a small problem”, said Colbert. “It is – what’s the word? – evidence. We keep getting more and more of it.” On Thursday, it was revealed that immediately after Trump’s 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a witness to the call, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, reported his concerns to a White House lawyer. That lawyer then moved the record of the call to an unusual, top-secret server. In other words, “it’s a cover-up!” said Colbert in the style of the Price is Right. “He’s won an all-you-can-televise impeachment hearing, a trial in the world-famous Capitol building and a free helicopter ride out of Washington on Marine One. Marine One: ride away in shame in style.” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also took a closer look at the House’s impeachment vote, which left Trump and his allies “freaking out”. Trump was so “wildly grasping at straws” about the vote, according to Meyers, that on Thursday morning he merely tweeted: “READ THE TRANSCRIPT!” “Yeah, we did,” said Meyers. “That’s how we found out about the crimes you committed. Trump’s like a bank robber who screams: ‘Watch the tape!’ And the jury watches the tape and it’s just him smiling straight into the camera holding up a bag of cash.” Several Republican congressmen spoke in defense of Trump – or, more accurately, as Meyers noted, spoke in confusing opposition to the impeachment inquiry process. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, for example, demanded the American people ask questions of history in a speech Meyers summarized as: “History will write this moment and then history will ask you a question so you want them to ask the historian a question and then answer the questions themselves?” His reasoning “sounds like you asked Siri to read a quote from Alexander Hamilton after spilling water on your phone”. The House vote allows for more witnesses to be called for public testimony, including the former national security adviser John Bolton, who contentiously left the White House in September. Since then, tensions have escalated between Trump and Bolton, “but the best part is these are all awful guys”, Meyers said. “Bolton’s an unrepentant warmonger, Trump of course is Trump, so it’s fun to watch them turn on each other and try to take each other down. “I don’t like watching nature shows where a lion kills a baby antelope but when they show a spider and a scorpion going at it, I am in.” Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel took the stage dressed as an orange circus peanut for Halloween. “I think I said I wanted to dress the same color as the president’s face and this is what happened,” he said of the costume. “It was not a happy Halloween for the Sour Patch Kid in the Oval Office,” said Kimmel. The House voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry, “which means … I don’t know what it means”, Kimmel admitted. “It means it will go to the Senate, and Republicans in the Senate will do nothing about it, and he’ll say he won, is probably what it means.” Still, Trump was not happy, tweeting that the impeachment inquiry was the greatest witch-hunt in American history on Halloween, and “READ THE TRANSCRIPT!” – “which, this is like Lori Loughlin saying, ‘Check my kid’s SAT scores!’” said Kimmel. No House Republicans voted in favor of the impeachment resolution, and the Senate’s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, blasted Democrats for “taking a vacation from the needs of the American people”. “In other words, instead of wasting time on this, you should be sending over more legislation for me to kill,” Kimmel explained. McConnell, Kimmel noted, is sitting on more than 100 bills right now – “he uses them to nest his terrarium”."
"Trevor Noah Another post-election day, another round of Donald Trump’s “bar fight with reality”, according to Trevor Noah, although that may be coming to an end with a death knell dismissal from the supreme court of a Republican-backed lawsuit to overturn the election in Pennsylvania. It took just 34 minutes from the brief’s filing for the court to issue a one-sentence rebuke: “the application for injunctive relief presented to justice Alito and by him referred to the court is denied”. There was no recorded dissent from any of the nine justices, including Trump’s three appointees. In other words, “Trump is taking L’s, people,” said the Daily Show host. “Not only did they shut this case down, but they shut it down in just 34 minutes. They didn’t even pretend that they were going to consider it! This is like asking somebody out and they just shut you down immediately. “You can’t blame the supreme court for not wanting to get involved in Trump’s case,” Noah added, “because we all have that one friend that when you see them crying, you think, ‘You know, I’m just gonna keep walking. Because if I try to help, it’s gonna become a whole thing …’” Samantha Bee On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee celebrated Trump’s final days in office, although “unfortunately, along with stealing all the copper wiring in the White House, Trump may spend his last days doing what he does best: making sure nobody in his life ever faces consequences”. The president has reportedly discussed pre-emptive pardons for some of his closest allies, including his three oldest children and son-in-law Jared Kushner, or perhaps even himself. “Presidential clemency is supposed to correct injustice,” Bee explained, “which, to be fair, some presidents have actually done.” Barack Obama commuted the sentences of hundreds of non-violent drug offenders, Jimmy Carter pre-emptively pardoned Vietnam draft dodgers, and George HW Bush “pre-emptively pardoned his digestive system before vomiting all over the Japanese prime minister.” “Presidents can use pardons for good, but abusing them doesn’t just protect bad people now, it also influences bad people later,” she added. Ford’s pardon of Nixon, for example, was ostensibly to heal the nation after the bruising Watergate scandal, “but if Nixon had faced real consequences, it could’ve made subsequent administrations think twice before abusing their power. That’s why whether or not Trump pardons himself, states still need to investigate him and his allies. “It’s not about vengeance, it’s about restoring our faith in institutions and strengthening the guardrails that have barely held over the last four years,” Bee concluded. “Because if we fail to learn from Trump’s attempts to defeat democracy, we’ll have no one but ourselves to blame when the next Republican administration comes along to finish the job he started.” Stephen Colbert “January 20 cannot come fast enough,” said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show, as he looked forward to the date when “America will usher in a glorious new era of basic competence” with newly announced, experience-based cabinet appointments. Biden announced this week that Dr Vivek Murthy will serve as his surgeon general and replace “the old surgeon general, a tongue depressor with googly eyes,” Colbert joked. Meanwhile, “despite Biden’s appointments, our current president continues to deny reality”, Colbert continued, as he reportedly considers mass pardons for staff, even those not accused of any crime. It’s “not really the behavior you expect to see from someone who’s going to be around for another four years”, Colbert explained. “If your 90-year-old grandpa starts taking a trip to Italy, skydives and has a threesome, he’s not crossing items off his ‘live forever’ list.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers blasted the president’s bungling of a deal with Pfizer for additional coronavirus vaccines. Because Trump passed on the deal months ago, Pfizer might not have more doses for the US until next June, while America faces potential vaccine shortages amid global competition. “I knew Trump was a shit businessman, but I didn’t realize he was this bad,” Meyers said. “I’m starting to think if you gave him a time machine, he’d go back to the year 2000 and buy stock in apples and Enron. “Trump championed the vaccine as the one thing he was doing to combat the virus,” Meyers added, “and even that he fucked up. It’s like if the Flash showed up to the Justice League with a pulled hamstring.” Meyers also recapped a peak Trump-era moment in which Fox News interrupted his campaign-style event for Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s vaccine initiative, to inform viewers of the supreme court’s dismissal of the Trump campaign’s Hail Mary lawsuit to overturn the election in Pennsylvania. “I’m not sure there’s a single moment that captures this farce better,” said Meyers. “It’s like if halfway through Sesame Street, Big Bird interrupted a song about the alphabet, looked straight into the camera and said: ‘Breaking news, kid. No one likes you, and you’re never going to learn how to spell.”"
"Going up close to a great work of art, perhaps to Auguste Rodin’s full-height sculpture of a shy Eve, is a rare pleasure in a neighbourhood gallery, especially since opening hours are now restricted by the pandemic. The Southampton City Art Gallery is one of those municipal buildings with perhaps more than its fair share of unexpected treats due to the bequest of a local chemist and businessman called Robert Chipperfield. He died rich in 1911, instructing his legacy to be spent on filling up a new gallery with top-notch pieces like Eve. Just over a decade ago the city considered selling valuable works including its Rodin sculpture, then worth just over £1million, to fund other projects, but the sale was stopped by a petition and a stern warning from the Tate, which had an advisory role. “We believe the sale of works acquired through the Chipperfield bequest to raise funds towards a capital project is not advisable and, indeed, not in the spirit of the bequest,” the Tate ruled back then. Today, in the grip of Covid-19, many galleries, museums and libraries, large and small, national and provincial, are considering making similarly controversial moves. A deep drop in revenue and donations has shaken the foundations of many a neo-classical portico. But should an artwork donated to the public ever be sold off as an asset? Writer Malcolm Gladwell has dared to say “yes” to this divisive question. Looking in particular at the wealthy arts citadels of Manhattan in his podcast Revisionist History in June, Gladwell used the phrase “dragon psychology” to characterise the thinking of the custodians of valuable cultural objects. He explained his argument to the Observer this weekend: “The dragon, in folklore, hoards treasure and virgins, even though he has no romantic interest in women and no desire to show or share or otherwise enjoy his treasure. “Since most major art museums now have upwards of 95% of their collections in storage – where they can’t be shown or shared or otherwise enjoyed – doesn’t that sound like dragon behaviour?” This autumn the Observer reported on the Royal Opera House’s decision to put a David Hockney portrait under the hammer to raise crucial funds, and also on the contentious fate of the Royal Academy of Arts’ famous Taddei Tondo; a marble sculpture by Michelangelo Buonarotti, the sale of which would rescue the institution from financial peril. Several other cultural and educational organisations have put historic objects up for sale after staring grimly at their balance sheets. The Royal College of Physicians was to sell a stack of rare books at Bonhams to deal with a funding shortfall of £3m, but now says it has taken “no firm decisions”. More than 600 of its fellows and members, including a former government chief scientific adviser, Mark Walport, were irate enough to pen an open letter to the president of the college arguing that a sale would represent “a breach of trust between the public, the benefactors and the college through the irreparable damage caused by the transfer of the college’s and the nation’s cultural inheritance into private hands”. In England, the rules about these matters are laid down by the Museums Association’s code of ethics, used to set Arts Council England’s standards, and they state that artefacts “should not normally be regarded as financially negotiable assets”. Last week it emerged the English public school Rugby is to auction a selection of valuable works including a 1632 second edition of A Shakespeare Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies with an estimate of between £20,000 and £30,000 and a first edition Christmas Carol by Dickens from 1843 that is likely to go for £4,000. The online sale at Forum Auctions takes place on Wednesday and does not, the school says, reflect any financial difficulty. Headmaster Peter Green said he simply wants the rare titles to be in specialist hands and added: “The school is committed, as a registered charity, to use its resources to benefit current and future students.” And there is a non-pandemic precedent. In 2018, Rugby made a cool £15m by selling off a collection of old master drawings at Christie’s. It is more difficult to remain sanguine, though, when the very purpose of your organisation is the making and sharing of art. At the Royal Academy of Arts (RA) opinions are split. Many believe retaining Michelangelo’s Tondo is essential to the spirit of the academy, while a smaller group of academicians argue that the work, as a last resort, is less important than the threatened jobs of staff. Certainly selling off the family silver, or “deaccessioning”, as it is known in curatorial circles, is not always judged beyond the pale. Alison Cole, editor of the Art Newspaper and author of a book about Michelangelo’s Tondo, knows it can be done properly. “It depends how you handle it,” she said. “Tate did it in an exemplary way a few years ago and were open about the process. On the other hand, it would be crazy for the Academy to sell the Tondo, one of the greatest examples of Michelangelo’s work in the country. It would be far too expensive for any other British gallery to buy, so we would lose it. “It is also a work that lays out the artist’s whole process and that seems highly appropriate for an academy.” Writing in the Spectator last month, art critic Martin Gayford was equally unhappy at the idea of the loss of the Tondo: “The RA has sometimes seemed unsure of what to do with it,” he admitted, but concluded: “The rationale, saving jobs and securing the RA’s financial future, is comprehensible. But I suspect that it would be a big mistake.” Over at the Victoria and Albert Museum the feasibility of editing down the collection is perhaps more obvious. Twenty years ago the former director Mark Jones and the late Matthew Evans, then chairman of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, debated how best to deal with the crates and crates of artefacts and design objects held in permanent storage. From this was born the idea of putting the V&amp;A stores on show at a new site in east London, as a kind of behind-the-scenes glimpse. The current director Tristram Hunt says plans for V&amp;A East are on track. “We have all these fantastic items that people will be able to come and see. It shows that with the right kind of thinking you can turn the issue around and make it an attraction in its own right, especially for researchers, without having to sell anything off,” he said. In America, strict guidelines that prevented such sell-offs were lifted this spring. Art collections in Syracuse, Indianapolis, Fort Worth and Laguna Beach, among others, have offered works for sale during a two-year “window” intended to help galleries and museums survive the devastating Covid-19 period. Yet planned sales by the Brooklyn Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art have provoked widespread protests. In Baltimore two artists on the gallery’s board of trustees resigned and a couple of leading benefactors withdrew support as a result of the agreed sale of Andy Warhol’s Last Supper and two other modern works. The Sotheby’s sale, which was called off with only two hours to go last month, would have raised $65m to spend on re-balancing the museum’s collection in favour of work from more diverse artists. It would also have gone, it was claimed, on improving staff salaries and conservation costs. Art is not for hoarding, argued Baltimore curators Asma Naeem and Katy Siegel: “Museums are not mausoleums or treasure houses, they are living organisms, oriented to the present as well as the past.” In an attempt to clarify the position in America, Brent Benjamin, president of the Association of Art Museum Directors, publicly welcomed Baltimore’s decision. “I am gratified to learn that the Baltimore Museum of Art has decided to reverse course,” he wrote. “As we have said consistently, our April 2020 resolutions were not intended to address needs beyond current, pandemic-related financial challenges.” Yet on the same night, Brooklyn Museum raised almost $20m from the sale of seven works by artists including Henri Matisse, Joan Miró and Claude Monet. The museum in New York had laid off 7% of its staff this summer. “The Monet happens to be lovely but is not one of his great works nor close to the best in our collection,” its director, Anne Pasternak, said. This month the leading international curator Francesco Bonami told ArtNews he believed the current debate might have a silver lining if it persuaded more galleries to focus on improved programming rather than on growth. “I don’t see anything wrong in selling work with a high market value that an institution considers redundant,” he said, adding: “Before a museum decides to sell its collection assets, it should first reduce other often exaggerated costs and maybe cancel a useless expansion.” Like Bonami’s criticisms, Gladwell’s attack on the “dragon psychology” of major cultural institutions is really an attempt to shake up the sheltered complacency they detect. Perhaps, then, it is not too cynical to suggest that some of the controversial high-profile sales of work this year are at least in part designed as public sacrifices that may win over hearts and minds at a time of austerity. Announcing the sale of Hockney’s 1971 Portrait of Sir David Webster, the illustrious former general administrator of the Royal Opera House, Alex Beard, chief executive at Covent Garden, told the Observer he knew it was important to make it clear to government and to potential donors that an institution often regarded as wealthy was willing to feel some real pain. The painting, which had originally been paid for with staff donations, sold at Christie’s for the lower end of its estimate at £11m, or £12.8m with fees. There is speculation that the buyer was David Ross, the founder of Carphone Warehouse, who took over as chair of the opera house this summer. Ross is known to collect Hockneys. Christie’s, however, is protecting the buyer’s anonymity. Art experts now wonder whether the art market will soon be flooded and sale values pushed down. But this looks unlikely in Britain, where museum ownership still adds lustre to the provenance of a lot. A more pressing danger is that future visitors to Britain’s smaller galleries will have fewer chances to bump into the life-size work of a renowned artist like Rodin. • This article was amended on 15 November 2020. An earlier version said that David Ross had promoted the idea of selling Hockney’s Portrait of Sir David Webster. The Royal Opera House has told us that it was not Ross who first proposed the sale."
"So much of what we take for granted today in British lifestyle can be traced back to the influence of my dear departed friend, Terence Conran. Starting in the early 1950s, as a 22-year-old gourmet entrepreneur, he brought a European awareness to our shores, starting with French bread and onion soup, in his restaurant the Soup Kitchen, just off the Strand. From then on, Terence was a tireless promoter of the benefits of good design, an approach that embraced the many different worlds that he touched as restaurateur, retailer, designer, developer, manufacturer, educator, writer and publisher. As if all that was not enough, he created, through the Conran Foundation, a showcase for design in the Boilerhouse Gallery within the V&amp;A, opening in 1981. This morphed into his London Design Museum in 1989, at Shad Thames near Tower Bridge, which moved in 2016 to its present location in the former Commonwealth Institute in Kensington. The lines between Terence’s private and professional lives were wonderfully blurred. Over more than two decades, our family lives overlapped with his and Vicky, his wife’s – from his country house Barton Court in Berkshire to his home in Provence and apartments in London. As a host, he could have been the chef in one of his restaurants, resplendent in a white apron – hospitable and generous. His appreciation of good food, wine, furniture, objects and buildings permeated his homes, workspaces, shops and restaurants alike. When you share values and interests, there is an expression of how someone “gets it”. When we talked of a common love of cars – and the black Citroën Traction Avant was one of his favourites – his eyes would light up with a boyish enthusiasm. Terence, unspoken, simply “got it” about so many things in life. These, for me, are the treasured moments of our friendship – and especially seeing him savour the qualities of the best cigar, with its equivalent cognac or whisky. Most likely, this could have been preceded by his favourite food such as the freshest langoustines, heaped in a bowl with dollops of mayonnaise or a whole loup de mer on a platter. The conversations through these delights would reveal Terence as holding strong views and moral principles with great integrity. Everyone in the UK has been the beneficiary in some way, however indirectly, of his influence. Only those who knew Britain in the 1950s, when he appeared on the scene, will know the full depth of that influence."
"Jimmy Kimmel Donald Trump still refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat on Thursday, though “reality is starting to peek through the windows at the White House,” said Jimmy Kimmel. Trump “might be going down with the ship, but many of the rats are putting their little bathing suits on amid increasing skepticism that their boss will be able to pull another rabbit out of his Maga hat”. “One reason that Trump’s advisers are so worried he might not be able to win is because he lost,” Kimmel continued, although acknowledgment of such a negative outcome is now anathema to Trumpism. “There’s no room for pessimism at the White House,” Kimmel said. “Racism, sexism, yes, but no pessimism. “The big orange guy is said to be feeling blue,” Kimmel added, because “soon he’s gonna understand what it feels like to be evicted from your home in the middle of a pandemic”. Trump’s children, meanwhile, are squabbling over how to handle their father’s intransigence; his daughter, Ivanka, reportedly fears the effect refusing to concede the election will have on Trump’s legacy. “Her father’s legacy?” Kimmel fumed. “Her father’s legacy is going to be a rusted half-section of wall on the border of Arizona.” Sons Don Jr and Eric, however, “realize that the main reason [Trump’s] raising money to fight this ‘fraud’ is to line his own pockets”, Kimmel said. “Come on, Ivanka, you get that. This is Trump 101 right here. “They say the last time the kids argued like this was when they fought over who got to shoot their injured polo pony,” he joked. “But I have to say, what a neat little microcosm of America that Trump’s actions are even tearing his own family apart. That seems just, to me.” Stephen Colbert “It seems like no one around the president has the nerve to tell him that he lost,” said Stephen Colbert on Thursday’s Late Show. And “despite clinging to the job desperately, he’s not actually doing any of it.” Instead, the president has reportedly watched more TV than usual in recent days. “More? How?” Colbert wondered. “Did he move the Resolute Desk to a Best Buy? “The president’s allergy to reality is hitting epic new highs,” as the White House has directed federal agencies to proceed with budget plans for a non-existent second term. “Now that is some industrial strength denial,” said Colbert. “At a certain point, even Norman Bates was like, ‘I’m starting to think my mom’s not looking too great.’” Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign has resorted to soliciting donations from supporters for his “official election defense fund”. “And he’s not being subtle about it,” Colbert said, describing the campaign websites’ dancing buttons as “shake your little money-taker!” According to the fine print, at least half of each donation will go to paying off the campaign’s debts; only donations of $8,000 or more will support so-far unsuccessful efforts to “investigate” baseless accusations of voter fraud. The fund is just “one last grift for the road”, Colbert said. “Before he finally leaves, someone better check under the Maga hat for the White House silverware.” Trevor Noah And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine Joe Biden’s transition to the presidency, such as denying him access to classified briefings and relegating communication with world leaders to ad-hoc, backdoor channels. “The real question is: why? Why won’t Trump just acknowledge that he lost?” Noah queried. “Why is he out there every day tweeting bogus videos and spreading conspiracy theories about election fraud. Why? Is it because of his fragile ego? Is it because he wants to take the country down with him?” It could be any of those things, Noah said, but “it could also be about the Benjamins.” The Trump campaign, not to mention Trump himself, remains deeply in debt; contesting the election and requesting donations to “count the votes” means more income from a presidential race that has ended. Over half of Trump’s “official election defense fund”, according to the fine print, actually goes toward paying off campaign debt and a slush fund that links directly to the president. “My man, Donald Jobless Trump – this guy never misses a hustle,” Noah said. “I mean, for anyone with brains, it looks like Donald Trump is scamming people out of their money by saying that his country wrongly kicked him out of power. “I guess I owe Donald Trump an apology,” Noah concluded, “because I honestly thought he could never change, but he has: the dude went from being an African dictator to a Nigerian prince.”"

"Live performance venues and events will be allowed to reach capacity of up to 75% in states that have recorded no new locally acquired coronavirus cases in 14 days, under the roadmap for reopening unveiled by federal arts minister Paul Fletcher on Friday. In what has been labelled the “Covid normal” of the near future, indoor events and seated outdoor events will still be ticketed only, and additional restrictions will still apply to large-scale multi-day outdoor music festivals. The plan was released by Fletcher at the Sydney costume workshop for the musical Hamilton, which is scheduled to open at the Lyric theatre in March. Fletcher also announced that $60m of the $75m Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (Rise) fund had been allocated to 115 arts organisations. “The funds will start to fly almost immediately,” he said. “The Office of the Arts within my department is engaging with individual recipients in terms of the grant agreements.” More than 300 arts organisations had applied for the federal government’s emergency rescue package announced in August. The government said that 71% of the total Rise funding will go to the small-to-medium sector, and 21% to regional areas. A total of $34m will be awarded to not-for-profit organisations. With states such as Queensland having already moved to 100% capacity in entertainment venues, Fletcher dismissed suggestions the roadmap should have come out weeks ago. “What it’s intending to do is to set a consistent framework and clearly it’s always the case that specific decisions are made by state and territory governments,” he said. “What we’ve done as a commonwealth government through the national cabinet is reached an agreed framework [across all states and territories].” If it wished, Victoria could move to 75% capacity immediately given it has recorded 21 straight days with no new coronavirus cases. NSW could hit the 14-day mark on Saturday. The joint announcement of the potential easing of social distancing restrictions and the pending release of $60m in funding was to place promoters, festival organisers and companies in a position to “not only know the way forward in terms of the public health requirements, but also [ensure they are] getting that support so they can get their shows up and running”, Fletcher said. With just one in three organisations that applied for Rise funding achieving success so far, Fletcher said unsuccessful applicants were welcome to reapply for the remaining $15m. “There will be feedback provided to those who were not successful, they’ll certainly be free to … put in an amended application that takes account of that feedback,” he said."
"In the year of Covid-19, theatres have been shuttered, orchestras unable to play, dance companies stilled. Museums and galleries opened briefly to seriously limited numbers, meaning slashed income from tickets, shops and cafes. Arts organisations around the UK, in short, are in dire straits. So here are some suggestions for midwinter cheer that will also support the arts. Solve Christmas – and help the arts. We’re all thinking it – and Jeremy Deller has got it printed on to wrapping paper. Proceeds from the artist’s Fuck You 2020 range, made with designer Fraser Muggeridge, will support the community and education programme of Studio Voltaire, a brilliant gallery in south London, as well as charities Young People Matter and Crisis This Christmas. Items in the range, bearing the same message, also include a digital print signed by Deller (£30), a Christmas stocking and a Santa hat. The national charity Art Fund has launched a crowdfunder called Together for Museums, aimed at raising £1m to distribute among the UK’s museums and galleries, 60% of which, according to the organisation’s research, are worried about their ability to survive the financial difficulties of the pandemic, despite government emergency funding. Donors can opt to receive “rewards”, which will be sent out in the spring. A donation of £15 means a bright and cheerful Supermundane “Hope” patch; £25 a set of David Shrigley tea towels; £100, a special-edition Michael Landy Look Around print in pink neon; £500, a limited-edition Lubaina Himid print. For the art lover with too much stuff already, pick something from the Fruitmarket Gallery gift registry. Instead of their receiving yet another dust-gathering tchotchke, the Edinburgh gallery will itself get a fabulous present thanks to your generosity. You can choose to donate, say, a pair of coat hooks (£20) or a toilet roll holder (£25); or, if any super-rich happen to be reading this, a beautiful ceramic drinking fountain designed by artist Tania Kovats (£15,000). The Fruitmarket was partway through a redevelopment and expansion when the pandemic struck. Delays to building work have meant increased costs, and donations through the gift registry will help give them the final push towards reopening next year. Donors will be invited to a celebration at the gallery next year (pandemic permitting) and recognised on a dedicated website page and leaflet. Doing a spot of Christmas shopping in any online museum shop will support that institution directly. Museums such as the V&amp;A, Tate, British Museum and National Gallery have extensive and renowned shops, but don’t forget the smaller contemporary art galleries, which often have intriguing items by local makers and designers, as well as objects made in collaboration with artists who have exhibited there. The Hepworth Wakefield shop, for example, has an elegant Barbara Hepworth planter by Alex Sickling (£30), and a clean-lined stove-top coffee pot designed by the Yorkshire gallery’s architect, David Chipperfield (£28), as well as stocking fillers like a a bee-friendly seed pack for £2.50. Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge stocks some striking jewellery by local designer Elsiem, and nicely made replicas (£45) of small-scale Gaudier-Brzeska sculptures in the collection. Fans of Tracey Emin can find her charming bird-decorated milk jug (£24.95) at Turner Contemporary’s Christmas shop. The Baltic in Gateshead has David Bowie and Yayoi Kusama baubles, plus a whole David Shrigley range, including his I’m So Hungover I Wish I Was Dead reusable water bottle (£25.95). In common with performing arts companies throughout the UK, English National Opera has had a devastating year, very largely unable to perform, to earn income, and indeed, to employ its usual army of freelance creatives. The company’s pre-Christmas fundraising drive is a raffle. Tickets cost £2 each, and could win you a two-night stay at the Hotel Bristol, Vienna, a private recital by ace Scottish tenor Nicky Spence, or many other miscellaneous treats, not all opera-related. Tickets are available to buy online until 11 December; winners are drawn on 14 December. Gladstone’s Library, in Flintshire, north Wales, is the only residential library in Britain, the basis of its collection being the personal library of the 19th-century prime minister (it is a kind of ancestor of US presidential libraries). Writers such as Sarah Perry and Naomi Alderman have worked on novels there through its excellent writer-in-residence scheme; it also runs public talks, festivals and courses, and a cheerful restaurant – all of which ground to a halt in 2020. (Full disclosure: I was one of the last writers to complete a residency there, in February, before the pandemic hit.) To help combat the devastating loss of income, the library is now inviting members of the public to sponsor a shelf in its beautiful gothic reading room for £100. That will help them get back on their feet – and re-employ their brilliant team – in 2021. Sign a loved one up to a friends’ scheme and give regular, sustained support. Tate membership, for example, means free entry to exhibitions, a subscription to the very good Tate Etc magazine, a discount in the shops, and access to friends’ rooms and bars. But check out schemes in your local venue too, which will almost certainly have some kind of programme: you can become a member of Storyhouse, Chester, for £4 per month, meaning discounted tickets and priority bookings; Hospitalfield in Arbroath has a special programme of talks, visits and events for friends; Glasgow Citizens Theatre has a tiered system, starting from £5 a month and bringing a 10% discount on tickets; Bristol Old Vic’s friends scheme offers up to 25% off tickets and priority booking. Raise a glass and help the Philharmonia Orchestra, which has worked with an artisanal gin producer to create a limited-edition Philharmonia Gin (£34.99), subtly flavoured with notes of Seville orange and cassia. A portion of proceeds will go to support the orchestra, whose ability to perform and earn income has plunged this year. What’s the connection between gin and orchestral musicians? The Philharmonia is resident orchestra at the Three Choirs festival and Ludlow Dry Gin is very much on the patch of that venerable institution, which rotates annually between Worcester, Hereford and Gloucester cathedrals – the 2020 edition, of course, being cancelled."
"It has been 30 years since a young photographer working in Albury-Wodonga walked into the Australian Centre for Photography in Paddington, Sydney and showed the director her 4x5 transparencies of a new photographic series she had been working on. The photographer was Tracey Moffatt and the resulting solo exhibition, Something More 1989 – with its now iconic images confronting race and rural disadvantage – put her on the art world’s international stage. “I remember being so broke that I could barely afford to make the large prints and frame them,” she recalls. That ACP opening, she says, was without doubt her big break. Something More #9 1989. Tracey Moffatt On 16 December, the ACP will close its doors. The term “hibernate” has been tossed about but the ACP director, Pierre Arpin, told Guardian Australia that after haemorrhaging money since 2016, the days of staging public programs, exhibitions and workshops is over. “We’ll take some time to consult with the community to determine what form the ACP could take in the future, but what’s clear is that we can’t afford to manage programs in a space where we receive absolutely no public funding anymore,” he said. Co-founded by David Moore in 1974, the ACP has exhibited the works and hosted major retrospectives of Australia’s elite cohort of photographers, including Max Dupain, Olive Cotton, Mervin Bishop, Bill Henson, William Yang, Trent Parke and Moffatt. Max Dupain’s Sunbaker “ACP was part of the cultural fabric of Sydney and it welcomed everyone in,” Moffatt says. In particular, the centre fostered the work of female photographers, Moffatt says – women such as Anne Ferran, Jacky Redgate, Robyn Stacey and the late Sue Ford. “[Ford] was a bold maverick and used her camera like a weapon. “I worry that such artists like her don’t receive recognition but I now look on the internet and Sue Ford is all over it, thankfully.” But the internet is no way to look at art or a photograph, she says. “There is nothing like standing in front of the actual artwork in a real gallery with good lighting.” Bill Henson had his first solo exhibition in the National Gallery of Victoria in 1975, at the precocious age of 19. He has exhibited a number of times over the decades at ACP, and during his lifetime he has watched the evolution of his chosen art form. Left to right: Modernist photograph of a young model at a fashion shoot, circa 1939, Modernist photograph of tea cups, circa 1935. Olive Cotton The advent of affordable easy-to-use instamatic cameras in the 1960s “democratised” photography, Henson says, and turned the camera into a household item. At the same time elaborate and costly photo assignments that had become the hallmarks of magazines such as Life and National Geographic were curtailed by the advent of image banks, opening up cheaper avenues for magazines and newspapers to illustrate their articles. Professional photographers’ frequent remonstrance may be that the smartphone has turned everyone into a photographer, but Henson says that started happening decades ago, when the world was introduced to instant imaging technology by Polaroid in the 1970s. Throughout this evolution, there has been changing public perception, he says, where photography now is no longer seen as “academic, of needing some kind of effort required and some knowledge of aesthetics and the visual arts” to something much more prosaic – the mass documentation of the minutiae of daily life, on Instagram and beyond. “[Photography] was always ubiquitous but now it saturates the environment, it’s absolutely central to everyone’s lives,” he says. “This casual documentation, to the point where this sort of pedestrian reportage has now become a very large part of the mainstream of photography-as-art – that’s had an effect on photography museums, galleries, and places like ACP.” Untitled. Bill Henson “Where you just don’t take a photograph but make a photograph, I think this has been under siege because of changes in technology and popular culture for some time. “It’s an interesting conundrum and I don’t know what the answer is ... but I don’t think [the ACP] perhaps realised how much the world around them was changing,” he says. “I think they could have been a lot more assertive facing those changes.” Henson’s advice to young photography students? To bear in mind that photography is a means to an end, not an end in itself. “If they felt that they could draw closer to those things they don’t fully understand through another medium – whether it’s high tech or low tech, a lump of clay or digital imaging technology – they need to think about that. “If I felt like I could get closer to the things that haunt my imagination by carving things out of wood, then that’s what I’d do. I’d stop [taking photos] and I’d do that. Untitled (Cat6), 2001, from the series Dream Life and Beyond. Trent Parke/ Magnum Photos Moffatt feels confident that the art form, and the way we exhibit that art, will continue to evolve. “Venues such as ACP will appear again in a different form,” she says. “Who cares if it might end up being a converted mine shaft on the outskirts of Lithgow? We will probably all still go and see the exhibitions. I know that I will. “The camera and the photograph have now been around for 200 years. This art form is still magical and it will continue to develop. How could it not?”"
"The Black Country Living Museum is an open-air attraction that tells the story of Britain’s early manufacturing history, set in the defiantly unstarry town of Dudley, in England’s industrial Midlands. Among the exhibits that have earned it a clutch of awards are two mine shafts, a lime kiln and a collection of postwar trolley buses. This month the visitor attraction gained another, more unexpected accolade, becoming – it believes – the most popular museum in the world on TikTok. It has more than 350,000 followers worldwide, and its short video clips, often featuring a cast of re-enactors in historic dress, can attract many more viewers. A recent video featuring a character called “1920s grandad” offering advice in a tar-thick Black Country accent has been viewed more than 2.2m times. “My favourite TikTok account giving me LIFE right now,” reads one of the clip’s almost 12,000 comments. For the hard-pressed heritage sector, struggling perennially to attract younger visitors and this year reeling from on-off Covid-related closure, this level of engagement with a new audience represents a kind of alchemy. Abby Bird, the museum’s communications manager, admits she had no expectation of such popularity when she launched the TikTok account in late August. “I remember thinking I would be really happy if we got 10,000 followers by Christmas,” she says. In fact, she cleared that hurdle after only her second post, a video of some of the museum’s actors strutting through its historic streets to a booming K-pop soundtrack, in parody of a street-style meme popular on the site. The museum has been named one of TikTok’s 100 top UK accounts for 2020, and after extensive searching, Bird can find no other museum in the world with more followers. The push to get on TikTok, she says, was lockdown itself, when the museum’s reduced schedule left her with some free time. Bird, 31, is a self-confessed TikTok addict, but not all her colleagues got it at first. “Once I explained the process to senior staff, they were very much like: ‘Well I don’t really understand how it works, and I don’t use it personally, but I trust you.’ Part of us being accessible as a museum is being in the spaces that young people are digitally.” That challenge is well understood by Adam Koszary, who had a brief and surreal moment of internet celebrity in 2018 when he was social media manager of the Museum of Rural English Life. One of his tweets, featuring an impressively proportioned sheep, became such a huge global meme that the billionaire Tesla-founder, Elon Musk, briefly changed his profile picture to that of the museum. Now in charge of social media for the Royal Academy in London, Koszary frequently advises other museums and galleries seeking to make their communications more effective. It is ironic, he says, that despite being in the business of telling stories, many “are still playing catchup to social media in a ton of ways. Even if they have massive followings, they’re still not quite connecting.” Both he and Bird agree that the key is in what Koszary calls “meeting the internet halfway”, taking time to discover what works on different platforms, and committing the resources to make the institution’s content and tone translate to that medium. That won’t always mean a sassy riff on viral memes, though the Yorkshire Museum has kicked off a lively Twitter dialogue by challenging other institutions to regular “curator battles” in which they are invited to link to items from their collections. Koszary points to the National Trust as an institution that has done “an amazing job” balancing its members’ interest in nature and history with the need to communicate its properties’ sometimes controversial backstories. The question is how to translate a viral following on social media into real value. “I suppose it really depends on how you define success as a museum,” says Bird. “Just because our doors are closed at the moment, that doesn’t mean our job stops. We’re focusing on visits to the website, conversations happening, the number of comments – all of those are really important indicators that people are taking in the story. And I have absolute confidence that that is going to lead to more visits.”"
"Barney Bubbles was once described as the “missing link between pop and culture” producing record sleeves, T-shirts and stage sets for the likes of Hawkwind, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury and Nick Lowe. He also directed the 1981 video for the Specials song Ghost Town, featuring the band glumly crammed into a 1961 Vauxhall Cresta being driven through the empty streets of London. On Monday, it will be announced that an archive of Bubbles’ work is now owned by the UK public, as part of a list of treasures by artists including Manet, Rembrandt and Chagall which are going into public collections thanks to the UK’s cultural gifts and acceptance in lieu (AiL) schemes. The latter scheme, created in Lloyd George’s 1910 “people’s budget”, allows cultural objects be left to the UK as a way of offsetting or settling inheritance tax bills. The cultural gifts scheme was introduced in 2013, and allows people to leave treasures in their lifetime. The 2019-20 year was a record one, an annual report reveals, with objects worth nearly £65m left to the public, settling tax of £40m. The Belinda Syme archive of Bubbles’ work and paraphernalia was comparatively small in terms of tax settlement (£16,500) but it is arguably one of the most fascinating collections on the list, shining light on a figure who his many fans say deserves to be better known. Born Colin Fulcher, Bubbles produced distinctive designs in the 70s and 80s for a huge swathe of punk, post-punk and new wave acts. He also designed the masthead for NME and the archer logo for Strongbow cider. The science fiction writer Michael Moorcock described Bubbles’ record covers as “lasting images for fleeting times” while Factory Records designer Peter Saville called him the “missing link between pop and culture.” Bubbles rarely signed anything he produced, shunned publicity – apart from an interview with The Face – and took his own life in 1983, aged just 41. The archive includes sketchbooks, drawing equipment, collages, photographs, badges, stickers, album covers and his library of reference books. It has been permanently allocated to Liverpool John Moores University in accordance with the wish of the donor. Edward Harley, chair of the AiL panel, said two-thirds of allocations had been made to institutions outside London. “The variety of objects remains as diverse as ever, and it is particularly exciting that the number of institutions receiving items through the scheme continues to grow.” Harley also highlighted significant acquisitions made to national museums in devolved nations. Wales has received an important Manet portrait of his cousin Jules Dejouy and a Corot landscape; Scotland a gouache titled L’Écuyère (The Horse Rider) by Marc Chagall; Northern Ireland six etchings by Rembrandt. Paintings by Leonard Rosoman that include the first gay kiss in British theatre history have been allocated to the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, West Sussex. Other archives now owned publicly include those of Lord Carrington, foreign secretary under Margaret Thatcher, which has gone to the Churchill Archives Centre; and barrister Jeremy Hutchinson, who defended Penguin in the Lady Chatterley’s Lover trial, which has gone to the University of Sussex. The annual report reveals that this is the first year that the maximum amount of tax which can be settled, £40m, was utilised. Among the more eclectic objects left is a collection of more than 50 fossils found in a West Lothian quarry which includes Westlothiana lizziae – or “Lizzie the Lizard” – thought to be the oldest known reptile. The collection was allocated to National Museums Scotland. • This article was amended on 21 December 2020 to remove a picture of Julian Cope that incorrectly said it was a photo of Bubbles and to properly credit the main photograph to his estate. It was further amended on 4 January 2021 to reflect subsequent changes to the annual report clarifying that the Bubbles collection was an archive donated by Belinda Syme."
"In what feels like a devastating sense of deja vu for the music industry, Faith No More, Jimmy Barnes and the Hoodoo Gurus have cancelled Australian shows in the lead-up to Christmas, among many other acts that have been spooked by the December spike in Covid-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant. Posting on his Facebook page at the weekend, Barnes said he was “absolutely heartbroken” over the outbreak in Newcastle, where his band was scheduled to deliver three concerts in December. Last week new Covid infections in the Hunter region accounted for almost a third of cases in New South Wales. The state recorded an unprecedented 3,057 cases on Tuesday. “In the interest of the community’s health and safety and the approaching family Christmas holidays, both our family and [the venue] Lizotte’s Newcastle have made the difficult decision to postpone the three December shows to a date still to be confirmed in early January,” Barnes posted. “We urge the local Newcastle community to seriously consider deferring any social events in Newcastle until after Christmas in order to help keep family Christmas gatherings safe, and to help protect their loved ones, the vulnerable and our essential workers.” The in-house booking manager for one of Newcastle’s most popular live music pub venues told Guardian Australia he had cancelled seven gigs in the past week, with bands expressing concerns at the prospect of finding themselves in lockdown on Christmas Day. Spencer Scott from Hamilton Station hotel said he probably should have seen the writing on wall when he booked two hardcore punk rock groups to perform last weekend. The bands were called Plague Dwellers and I Hate People. After a potentially infectious case was traced to one of Newcastle’s largest live music venues, the Cambridge hotel, posted on its Facebook page on 13 December: “Our staff have all gone to get tested and once they come back negative we’ll be back to rock n roll.” The next day the Cambridge announced it was postponing its Hiatus Kaiyote show scheduled for the following evening. On 16 December, it threw in the towel. “We are going to sit it out until after Christmas,” it posted on Facebook. “We have a role to play in our community and at the moment that means limiting everyone’s chance of exposure … Be safe and see you after Xmas.” The same day NSW Health announced that Newcastle’s Lunar Electric music festival scheduled for 18 December had been cancelled, under a public health order. In a Facebook post on Saturday Ben Cavenagh, a stage manager for the event, wrote: “Lots of lost jobs, lost income, and just a feeling of going around in circles again. Really tired of this.” Widespread cancellations across Australia The retreat of live music in the Hunter is being replicated across the country. This month Frontier Touring and Triple M announced the postponement of a Hoodoo Gurus and Dandy Warhols’ December tour to April 2022. In the Sydney, the past week saw the cancellation of a number of live music events, including the Bad Vibrations festival, the Loose Ends Xmas party and Christmas Time in the Inner West. The ticket retailer Oztix told Guardian Australia more than 300 of its events over the Christmas period – from 1 December to 7 January – had either been rescheduled, postponed or cancelled altogether. “One trend we’re seeing again and again that is really worrying is a member of a band or a band’s touring party becomes a close or casual contact and has to isolate, forcing the entire tour to stop,” an Oztix spokesperson told the Guardian. “So, a tour may have been rescheduled 2-3 times already, the band finally starts the tour, gets a few shows in … and they have to cancel. That’s always the real heartbreaker.” Renewed calls for national insurance scheme On Monday a coalition of live music and entertainment industry bodies reissued a plea to the Morrison government and state and territory leaders to urgently deliver a government-backed insurance scheme to protect the live performance sector from crippling cancellations. In November a Senate committee inquiry concluded that an insurance guarantee to future-proof the industry was not the responsibility of a federal government because it was Australia’s states and territories that made the call on border closures, lockdowns and social distancing measures. Only Victoria has since instituted its own state-run live music insurance product. The statement from the live performance coalition, which includes the copyright agency Apra Amcos, the Australian Recorded Music Industry Association and the Association of Artist Managers, said the emergence of Omicron showed the pandemic crisis was far from over. “For an industry getting back on its feet, investing nationally and working hard to get shows back on stage and touring, the ongoing threat of future business disruption is very real,” the statement said. While the Victorian development was welcome, the live performance coalition said a national scheme was urgently needed to reflect the industry’s “national economic and employment footprint”. The I Lost My Gig Collective has estimated that, on average, the Australian live music sector has lost about $64m in income each month since March 2020, totalling $880m in lost income so far. A survey conducted by the collective found that 99% of respondents had no income protection or event cancellation insurance. Support Act, the charity that is delivering crisis relief services to artists, crew and music workers, has received $40m from the federal government since May 2020. During this time the charity has delivered financial assistance to 2,540 members totalling $8m (compared with 389 people totalling $1.1m in 2019), and provided more that 7,000 grants totalling $15.2m. Most of the funding was related to performing arts workers whose livelihoods have been impacted by Covid-19."
"When she walked into the London casting room of The Wheel of Time, Madeleine Madden scanned the faces – a sea of white – and thought, “Yep, standard.” To announce her presence, she politely inquired, “The Wheel of Time?” “They were like, ‘Oh no – upstairs’,” she recalls. “Then I walked into the actual room and it was such a diverse room of people, I just felt so relieved. For so much of my life I was the odd one out. Here they’d done a worldwide search and brought in people from all over who they felt they were the best for the job.” Madden had starred in Australia’s first Indigenous teen drama, Ready for This, and Redfern Now, a critically praised drama following Aboriginal families living in the Sydney suburb, which should have been considered a triumph – yet she was told by an industry insider that she’d never need to get dialect sessions because she’d never find a job outside Australia. “It was something that was just such a casual throwaway comment, but I was like, ‘Yes, I’m being put in this box once again, and being told what I can and can’t aspire to,’” she says. As things transpired, Madden has found freedom overseas. She went on to have a key role in the Hollywood blockbuster Dora and the Lost City of Gold, and now she’s the heroine of The Wheel of Time, the scenic Amazon-commissioned fantasy series based on the books of Robert Jordan, with a notably multiracial cast. Madden’s entrance is dramatic: as apprentice healer Egwene al’Vere, she is violently pushed from a cliff (a stunt she undertook herself) in an initiation ceremony. It’s a fitting metaphor for the actor, who describes taking on the role as “sink or swim”. She’s 24 now, and this project (the number of seasons as yet unknown, though there are 14 books) will likely document all of her 20s. (It’s safe to say she’ll also be invited to comic cons for the rest of her life.) Right now, promotional images dominate billboards in Times Square and Piccadilly Circus. With the cast and crew having been in a tight bubble – shooting on location in Czech Republic, Slovenia and Croatia for two years, on sets such as a quaint village built into a quarry outside Prague – it must be discombobulating to resurface into such scrutiny. The most bankable name on board is Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl, Pride and Prejudice, Beirut), who plays Moiraine Damodred, one of the Aes Sedai sisterhood of sorceresses. Yes, the hero’s journey narrative, so common in blockbuster movies, has had a gender flip. In the books, of which 90m copies have been sold since their inception in 1990, the female characters were more feisty than feminist – and all notably buxom. In showrunner Rafe Judkins’s adaptation, they’re contemporised for a more progressive, PC audience. “Particularly with Egwene and Nynaeve, we really get insight into their thinking and their lives, which we may not necessarily get in the books,” Madden says. “Women are at the forefront in this story, and it’s such a celebration of not only diverse people, but diverse ways of thinking and perspectives.” Many moons ago (well, 2017), Jeff Bezos had a prophesy that Amazon Studios would produce shows to outperform Game of Thrones, and so there’s a lot banking on The Wheel of Time – $10m an episode, in fact. But this creation is far more YA in tone than its HBO rival. The cast is largely young and clean-cut, playing “dentally sound peasants”, and morality is as central a conceit as it is in Lord of the Rings (the rights of which Amazon has also bought, for $250m). The frequent earnest exposition monologues threaten to outnumber the gruesome deaths, and future headlines in the vein of “Game of Thrones walks fine line on rape: how much more can audiences take?” seem unlikely. As Madden says, “The darkness definitely creeps into the series as we go along further, but I don’t think there is a glorification of physical violence or sexual violence in our story, which is quite unique for the fantasy genre.” Madden calls Egwene the “dream role”, relating to her character’s core values and sense of duty. Being born into a family known for its activism and creativity has a profound influence on her career; Madden’s grandfather was Aboriginal rights activist Charles Perkins; her film-maker aunt, Rachel Perkins, founded Blackfella Films; and her mother is art curator and writer Hetti Perkins. “I’ve been raised by strong women in my life, who have sacrificed a lot for me to be where I am. And I think that’s the same with Egwene,” Madden says. “You know, literally what doesn’t kill her makes her stronger, and I feel that’s something that I also take on.” As a teenager in Australia, she’d delivered a televised address to the nation, on behalf of Generation One, an Indigenous initiative seeking education and employment parity. “I just remember being like, this is something that I could get behind as a kid,” she says. “I didn’t really understand the gravitas at the time, or the scale of what this was.” After the broadcast, Madden became a target, and not just of children at her school. “Obviously, this brought out some nasty things from the woodwork, and that was quite shocking, being a 13-year-old kid,” she says. “And having adults come for you, which was just insane.” But rather than discourage her, the pushback crystallised Madden’s belief that the campaign was important. “It’s been instilled in me since I was young that I have to use my platform to change the world. That’s something that’s part of my DNA,” she says. “I think also that just being born as an Aboriginal woman, my life is politicised, so that’s something I’ve dealt with every day of my life.” Politics certainly promise to shadow The Wheel of Time as each episode is released. Early opinions on Twitter veer from dismissing it as a “woke show” to applauding the diversity in the casting that moves beyond being tokenistic. Critical reviews are more singular in their disappointment, though Madden is often singled out for praise. Forbes called her likable and observed that she was given a less restricted role than that originally created by Jordan, while Gizmodo observed the depth and nuance she gave to Egwene, at odds with the “stereotypes and cliches” of the books. The first three episodes of The Wheel of Time are now available to stream on Amazon Prime Video, with further episodes released weekly"
"Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel came to Anthony Fauci’s defense on Tuesday evening, condemning Republican officials and Fox News pundits who have smeared the doctor’s character amid concern over the new (and still poorly understood) Omicron variant of the virus. Kimmel tore into such rightwing figures as Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Rand Paul, who in recent days have labeled Fauci a self-proclaimed “deity” and dismissed his scientific advice as self-motivated grandiosity; Fox Nation host Lara Logan even compared him to the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, drawing condemnation from the Anti-Defamation League and the Columbia School of Journalism. Kimmel was out of patience. “Let me tell you screwballs something about Dr Fauci, because I’ve had enough of this and he’s too nice to say this himself,” he said. “This man has been working on behalf of the public, that’s us, for more than 50 years,” serving under six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan. “To suggest that his politics have anything to do with his work or what he recommends? It’s ridiculous, and it’s a lie, and he doesn’t deserve it.” Kimmel continued to decry “scumbags” like Paul, Cruz, and “that vile, inflatable Macy’s parade balloon of dogshit Tucker Carlson” for attacking Fauci’s credibility and character. “The reason they do it is so they can keep terrifying old people, which is basically what they do for a living: they scare senior citizens in order to get ratings and money and votes, but to do that they need villains. To scare Grandma, they need fresh villains. So they zero in on this tiny, adorable old man who’s done nothing but good for the world. “They’d say he invented mosquitoes if people were dumb enough to believe it,” he added. “And guess what, people are dumb enough to believe it.” Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on the new Omicron variant, which, according to some scientists seems to be more transmissible, though cases appear to be mild. “So we’re grading the variants on the salsa scale now,” the host joked. “In that case, I look forward to the Atomic Ghost Pepper Extra Chunky Variant.” It will be weeks until definitive data becomes available, but preliminary reports suggest the variant could evade vaccines. “It’s a scientific phenomenon known as Aaron Rodgers,” Colbert quipped. In response to the variant, Joe Biden attempted to calm the public on Monday, calling Omicron “a cause for concern, not a cause for panic”. “What? I’m sorry, I wasn’t listening, I was ordering 700 rolls of toilet paper – out of concern, not panic,” Colbert responded. Biden also promised to unveil a new strategy this week “outlining how we’re going to fight Covid this winter, not with shutdowns or lockdowns, but with more widely spread vaccinations, boosters, testing and more”. “And more? Can you be more specific than ‘and more’?” Colbert noted. “Is this the health of our nation or the weird kitchenware and food section of TJ Maxx – ‘Don’t panic folks, we’ll treat this with vaccinations, boosters, testing, a journal that says ‘hope’ on the front, a broken egg timer and a bottle of what appears to be maple syrup that has no label on it.’” Trevor Noah And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah tore into Republican conspiracy theories over the Omicron variant. Former White House physician and current Maga congressman from Texas Ronny Jackson, for instance, tweeted that Omicron was the “midterm election variant” concocted by Democrats to encourage mail-in voting. “Just so I’ve got this straight: according to this conspiracy, the Democrats’ big plan is to intentionally never solve the one problem that is ruining everyone’s life?” Noah wondered. “That is such a dumbass strategy to win an election. “You realize for this to be true, the Democrats would’ve had to coordinate on this lie with the World Health Organization AND South African scientists AND governments across Europe,” he continued. “Are you serious, people? You know the Democrats can’t coordinate shit. The only thing Democrats can coordinate is their Kente cloths.” Noah also took former Trump adviser Stephen Miller to task for arguing on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show that the US would “already have modified vaccines” for new variants if Trump were still in office. “The idea that Donald Trump would’ve quickly handled a Covid variant is by far the least believable shit I have ever heard,” he said. “You’re going to act like we all don’t know this man? There’s no way he would’ve handled it. “First of all, he would’ve spent four months denying there was even a new variant, then he would’ve wasted six more months saying that the vaccines were on their way, but also don’t worry about it because it’s not going to hurt anybody, but also the vaccines are coming. Then he would’ve gotten Omicron himself, and then he would’ve been like ‘Omicron is real, folks! And I made it, I karate chopped it so hard.’”"
"On the home screen of my iPhone – on the very left, second row from the top – sits an app I frequent regularly. In fact, according to my diagnostics, an average of six minutes a day. The small rounded-square logo – yellow, white and grey – is designed to depict the top section of a notepad. But like most people, I don’t use it like a notepad. The Notes app – which has its off-brand equivalents for Android users – is my favourite of all the apps. It feels trustworthy. It’s safe. It feels like a safe, in which to store my secrets, my afterthoughts, my memory-doubts. It’s an old friend to confide in; a place where I can be completely vulnerable. It’s also a place to write haphazard measurements of a new fridge. That this one place can be both for wholly secret thoughts and the most mundane details of life: this is what gives it its unique charm. And it’s why, for the last few years, I have been asking my friends to share their Notes with me – and why I’ve begun collecting and cataloguing them. In her 2017 debut essay collection, Too Much and Not the Mood, writer Durga Chew-Bose describes shopping and to-do lists as “un-poems”. Texts of meaning which are, for others, indiscriminate and unintelligible. It’s the same with the Notes app. The language we use is often so prosaic that it becomes a poetry of its own kind. An unlikely tapestry sewn together by proximity. A place where we digress intentionally. There’s no judgement in this app. No grammar is considered, there’s no reason to use spell check. It’s a completely raw depiction of our thoughts, messy and muddled and page after page of items that are rarely titled, from dog names to salad recipe to things I didn’t think I’d say today. Looking at them out of context can bring about a sense of art. It’s jazz – or, honestly, it’s punk. Sometimes I share my own Notes at dinner parties: the perfect conversation starter with phones close at hand. I watch my friends across the table go through their own apps as the conversation begins; from curiosity to realisation, to mental cataloguing, and then the sudden discovery of some tidbit of information they thought lost – but now really need to share. Looking through someone else’s Notes feels voyeuristic, dirty, almost illegal. The app, when used often, holds our idiosyncrasies and disturbingly human qualities, so much so that they could be considered personality graffiti – marrying boredom with fleeting thoughts, like the words etched into cubicle stalls. They are also a time capsule, packed with outdated references, numbers and titles, revealing past personas, fears, plans and anxieties. If the theory of multiple universes is true, I believe the intersection could be found through our Notes. One set of listed items across our multiple lives, running in parallel with each other. For those who use the app, it’s a secret reliance we all share which – like those spots just out of focus in your eyes when you close them – give us something else to turn our attention to every once in a while. Since writing this I have asked many people about how they use their Notes. One friend uses the app to draft every single important text message she’s ever sent; another has made a habit of cataloguing his drunken thoughts in the cab home from a night out. My girlfriend’s father simply uses it to write down all the measurements he needs on the building site. How people use this tool can tell us a lot about them. This is why Notes is my favourite of all the apps, and why I continue to collect them as screenshots, nearly all anonymous, stored in a folder on my phone. The more I collect, the more I come to understand they will always be forever personal. Only the author can see each Note for what it truly is."
"It was a family ramble through fields during lockdown last year that led to an “oh wow moment”: the discovery of a Roman villa complex containing a rare mosaic depicting Homer’s The Iliad, now thought to be one of the most remarkable and significant finds of its kind in Britain. The mosaic – the first example found in the UK displaying scenes from the Greek epic poem, and only one of a handful from across Europe – was found beneath a farmer’s field in Rutland. It is now protected by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on the advice of Historic England. The site was discovered by Jim Irvine, son of the landowner, Brian Naylor, during the 2020 lockdown, and has been investigated by archaeologists from the University of Leicester in partnership with Historic England and Rutland county council. Their investigation revealed the mosaic lies within an elaborate villa complex encompassing a host of other structures and buildings. It is likely to have been occupied by a wealthy individual from the late Roman period, sometime between the 3rd and 4th century AD. “A ramble through the fields with the family turned into an incredible discovery,” Irvine said. “Finding some unusual pottery among the wheat piqued my interest and prompted some further investigative work. “Later, looking at the satellite imagery I spotted a very clear crop mark, as if someone had drawn on my computer screen with a piece of chalk. This really was the ‘oh wow’ moment, and the beginning of the story.” The remains of the mosaic measure 11m by almost 7m and form the floor of what is thought to be a large dining or entertaining area. Though mosaics were used in a variety of private and public buildings across the Roman empire, and often featured famous figures from history and mythology, there are only a handful of depictions of Achilles’ battle with Hector at the conclusion of the Trojan war. The villa is surrounded by what appear to be aisled barns, circular structures and a possible bath house. Human remains were also found in the rubble covering the mosaic, which were likely interred after the building was no longer occupied. John Thomas, deputy director of University of Leicester Archaeological Services and project manager on the excavations, called it “the most exciting Roman mosaic discovery in the UK in the last century”. “It gives us fresh perspectives on the attitudes of people at the time, their links to classical literature,” he said. “This [the villa’s owner] is someone with a knowledge of the classics, who had the money to commission a piece of such detail, and it’s the very first depiction of these stories that we’ve ever found in Britain.” Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, added that discoveries like this were “so important in helping us piece together our shared history”."
"Going Out: Cinema King Richard Out now Starring Will Smith, this biopic of Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, tells the story of a parent/coach so dedicated to his job that his daughters would transform tennis for ever. It’s a much-overused phrase, but the man is a literal gamechanger. Petite Maman Out now A delicate, autumnal, 72-minute dream of a film, the latest from the French director Céline Sciamma finds a little girl connecting emotionally with her mother, in a magic realist time-loop where they are both eight years old. Highly recommended, and not as twee as that premise might suggest. Drive My Car Out now A brainy and brilliant film based on a short story by Haruki Murakami, Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s stately adaptation takes its time to build an intimate portrait of a Japanese theatre director grappling with the infidelities of his late wife, an anxiety he expresses through his work staging a production of Uncle Vanya.

John Fordham * * * Going Out: Art Dürer’s Travels National Gallery, London, 20 Nov to 27 Feb Albrecht Dürer is the Leonardo of the north, an endlessly curious mind. This exhibition chases his restless Renaissance spirit by following his journeys to Venice, where he fancied the soldiers, and Flanders where he saw and praised Aztec art. His images of new landscapes and strange beasts are utterly beguiling. Lubaina Himid Tate Modern, London, 25 Nov to 3 Jul The art of Himid is not everyone’s idea of “modern”. She won the Turner prize, after all, with an installation that restages Hogarth and paints enigmatic and perturbing narrative scenes. Yet she switches to conceptual art to theoretically dissect media images. This show should be a bracing intellectual blast. Fabergé in London Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 20 Nov to 8 May Fabulous for fashionistas … and historians of Russian-British relations. This exhibition shows how Peter Carl Fabergé, egg-maker to the tsar, set up a London branch in 1903 to sell ornate wonders including a bejewelled cigarette case to the oligarchic Edwardian elite. It’s a glittering portrait of a gilded age. Howardena Pindell Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, to 2 May The 78-year-old Pindell has been fighting racism for decades. She combats injustice with direct, explicit interventions such as her 1980 video Free, White and 21, and paintings that engage with the history of slavery and apartheid. Yet she also makes gorgeously sensual abstract canvases that breathe the politics of beauty.

"At least three arts organisations have pulled out of Sydney festival over a sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy, amid calls for a boycott. The protests, backed by a coalition of Arab and pro-Palestinian organisations and assorted artists and academics, are over a $20,000 sponsorship deal to stage a production of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin’s Decadance by the Sydney Dance Company. So far, Blake Prize-winning artist Khaled Sabsabi, Malyangapa and Barkindji rapper Barkaa, South Asian dance company Bindi Bosses, the Arab Theatre Studio, the Bankstown poetry slam and comedian Nazeem Hussain have pulled out of the 2022 festival. According to a statement released on Wednesday by the Palestinian Justice Movement Sydney, the sponsorship deal was sealed in May, the same month Israeli armed forces launched a series of air attacks on Gaza, killing a number of Palestinian civilians. “Palestine advocates call on all opponents of apartheid to boycott the 2022 Sydney Festival,” the statement said. “By partnering with Israel, Sydney festival will … contribute to the normalisation of an apartheid state.” In an open letter published on the Meanjin website on Thursday, a coalition of artists and writers said that they considered the Sydney festival’s continued partnership with the Israeli embassy was “disgraceful” and accused the festival of “creating a culturally unsafe environment for Arab artists and audiences who want to be part of the festival but who now cannot, in good conscience, participate as they bear witness to the slaughter, occupation and oppression of Palestinians”. Naharin has stated on a number of occasions his support in principle for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movements’s agenda on human rights for the Palestinian people. But, responding to request from Brian Eno to cease using his musical works in an Israeli embassy-sponsored Batsheva Dance Company production in Tel Aviv in 2016, the choreographer described such boycotts as “lazy” and “essentially useless”, adding he believed there were more effective ways of helping the Palestinian cause. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia on Thursday, a festival spokesperson said it would not be terminating its agreement with the Israeli embassy. “The festival is unwavering in its commitment to ensuring a culturally safe space for all artists, employees and audiences,” the statement said. “[The festival] will be reviewing all funding arrangements with embassies and cultural organisations to ensure that any continuance of these partnerships are compatible with maintaining a welcoming and culturally safe environment moving forward.” In an earlier statement this week, the Sydney festival board said it was unable to support the BDS movement as requested by the coalition (which includes the Arab Australian Federation, Greens for Palestine, Independent Australian Jewish Voices, Jews against the Occupation Sydney, the Sydney representative for BDS and United Australian Palestinian Workers) because the festival was a nonprofit, non-political organisation. One of the co-authors of the Meanjin letter is writer Michael Mohammed Ahmad, who was due to join the festival board later this year and has now rejected the appointment. The open letter described the festival’s position as “a hollow claim given the Festival is politically aware enough to platform First Nations and ‘minority’ or ‘diverse artists’. “How is it that the festival can reconcile its commitment to Indigenous solidarity here while legitimising and normalising relations with a settler colonial apartheid state that maintains a system of racism, subjugation and land theft against Palestinians?” the letter asked. Writer and academic Anita Heiss tweeted: “For an arts festival to claim they are apolitical is embarrassing to say the very least.” A statement from the Israel embassy in Canberra sent to the Guardian on Thursday said: “Israel has always and will continue to promote cultural exchange and engage in cultural dialogue in numerous countries including Australia. “Culture is a bridge to coexistence, cooperation and rapprochement and should be left out of the political arena.” Earlier this year the Melbourne Queer film festival faced a similar backlash for screening an Israeli state-funded film."
"At least five national attractions including the Natural History Museum and Edinburgh Castle have closed because of the surge in Covid cases. The start of the Christmas school holidays is usually one of the busiest times at the Natural History Museum but it will be closed from Tuesday “due to an unforeseen staff shortage”. Other museums closed because of Covid include London’s Wellcome Collection in Euston, the National Army Museum in Chelsea, and the Foundling Museum in Bloomsbury. The British Museum remains open but warned visitors that some galleries may have to close at short notice. The Natural History Museum, the second most visited museum in the UK after Tate Modern, said it would remain closed for at least a week. “We have made the difficult decision to close our South Kensington site from Tuesday 21 December due to front-of-house staff shortages which have been affected by Covid-19 infections and isolation requirements. This is not a decision we have taken lightly but the safety of staff and visitors must always come first,” it said. “If you have bought tickets for wildlife photographer of the year or Fantastic Beasts: the Wonder of Nature for these dates, these will be cancelled and refunded. If you have bought tickets to one of our events we will email you with further information.” The museum’s ice rink, operating outside the building this year for the last time, will remain open. Edinburgh Castle, the second most visited attraction in Scotland, announced a temporary closure on Sunday that remains in place. In a series of tweets, it said: “We are sorry to let you know that we will temporarily close the castle as of 4pm today [Sunday] following a number of staff members testing positive for coronavirus. All members of staff identified are now self-isolating.” On Friday the Wellcome Collection in Euston, north London, announced it was also having to close until further notice after a surge of cases. The Foundling Museum said it had taken the “difficult decision” to close over the Christmas period and would not open again until 4 January. The National Army Museum said would be closed until 5 January “due to the impact of Covid-19”. The Museum Association’s journal reported that many museums had postponed or cancelled events and were rethinking their plans for the new year. A source at an unnamed London museum said it was struggling to keep all of its galleries open after a Covid outbreak among staff. The source was quoted as saying: “It feels a bit irresponsible for us to still be open and interacting with the public as some have tested negative lateral flow in the morning then positive halfway through their work day. We are dropping like flies and I really don’t see how they stay open for the next week.” The closure of museums comes as theatres have had to cancel performances during the festive period, which usually generates about a third of their income. As Omicron cases continue to rise, the government is considering “circuit break” restrictions which could include closing indoor entertainment venues again. But many theatres – including the National Theatre and the Young Vic – have already postponed shows to allow cast, crew and front of house staff to isolate. Of the 46 full members of the Society of London Theatre that had shows running this weekend, 22 cancelled their performances. They included huge tourist attractions such as Hamilton, Matilda, Wicked, The Lion King, and Cinderella. Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the industry was in a “dreadful state”. “It’s literally day-to-day. We spend all morning trying to work out if we can do the show or not,” Mackintosh told BBC News. Bookings for the first part of 2022 were also well below expectations, he added, which was “really worrying” for the industry. “We’ve all used our reserves to get the shows back up,” he said. “We are in a dreadful state at the moment and desperately need the government to help commercial theatre going through the next few weeks.” Theatres have told the Guardian they have been left “in crisis mode”, “on a knife-edge” and “terrified” of what the next weeks will bring. Many believe the industry is in its most precarious position, even after almost two years of uncertainty. Arts union Equity has called on the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to take action to protect workers in the creative industries, saying the current situation threatened “the fragile return of live performances”. Sharon Heal, director of the Museums Association, said: “Omicron has had an impact on museum staff because it is so transmissive. A large proportion of people who work in museums work in public facing positions, so they are vulnerable to picking up Covid.” She said the closures are likely to have hit museum’s finances. Heal said: “Christmas and Easter are the two big seasons for museums in terms of visitors, events and retail. And all of that is going to be adversely affected by the new variant. We would like to see some recognition from government that museums are being hit and that funding is needed.”"
"Bernard and the Genie, a 1991 British made-for-television fantasy-comedy, is a Christmas sleeper with an impressive pedigree. The script, written by a young Richard Curtis, is a rollicking tale of good versus evil delivered by an impressive cast of comedians including Lenny Henry, Rowan Atkinson and Alan Cumming. The opening scene takes place 2,000 years ago in an era of vengeful sorcerers, evil spells and, confusingly, Jesus of Nazareth. Bethlehem circa AD30 is not the kind of place you would normally associate with magic lamps and flying carpets but, if it’s cinéma vérité you’re after, this is not the film for you. A wizard’s curse on man-mountain Josephus (Henry) transforms him into a tiny genie who must remain in a magic lamp for eternity. Or at least until a heartbroken Bernard Bottle (Cumming) finds the lamp, his last remaining possession after his two-timing girlfriend has cleared out their apartment and moved in with his best friend. Earlier that day Bernard, a fledgling art dealer, discovered some priceless works belonging to a couple of naive old ladies. His workmates fete him with flowers, champagne and kisses on his arrival that morning to the accompaniment of a song titled Mr Success, memorable for its classic 90s line “From the shine on his shoe to the star in his eye / If he were a girl he’d be Princess Di.” To Bernard’s dismay, his honest intentions to compensate the women result not in an expected promotion from his boss, Charles Pinkworth (a superbly waspish Atkinson), but in a direction to get his “philanthropic little arse” out of the gallery. And so we find an unemployed Bernard at day’s end, stripped of flowers, champagne and worldly possessions, rubbing a lamp with the cuff of his shirt – thus causing it to explode – and winding up in an emergency ward with a bang to the head and one slightly scorched testicle. On his return to his apartment, he’s greeted by a shadowy presence that turns out to be a sabre-wielding, two-metre-tall genie with murder on his mind. “Your wish is my command,” snarls the genie. “Beware, oh short one. You smell of peppermint and it is time to die.” Once Bernard has confirmed that his wish is indeed the genie’s command, they call a truce and introduce themselves. On discovering that Josephus has been in the lamp for 2,000 years, Bernie introduces him to Mozart, Barry White (“What colour is this guy?” asks a besotted Josephus) and Big Macs. And Josephus introduces his diminutive master to his two kittens, fantastic pants and flying carpet rides. Bernard and the Genie alternates between buddy movie and parable as the two friends discover 1990s London at the height of the festive season, with all its rampant commercialism and material excess. “Tell me about this Christmas thing,” says Josephus. Bernard begins with the birth of Jesus. “But I knew this guy!” Josephus exclaims. He is horrified that such a “wonderful guy” was crucified. Together, he and Bernard decide to right some wrongs and “make some wishes for Big J”. They start with Pinkworth, then move on to Bernard’s ex-girlfriend and her new beau. In between, Bernard grants wishes to children in the Santa queue and a lottery win to the doorman at his apartment block. Bernard’s final grand gesture is to grant Josephus a wish. In return Josephus gives his friend a surprise gift designed to give Bernard the merriest of Christmases. It works of course – it’s from Richard Curtis, after all. Bernard and the Genie is dated, the production values are rough and the special effects are laughable. But throw in a cheesy soundtrack that includes Slade’s Merry Xmas Everybody and Bowie’s The Jean Genie and cameo appearances by 90s celebrities including Melvyn Bragg and Bob Geldof and you’ve got yourself a real cracker of a film. • This article was amended on 24 December 2021. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Bernard and the Genie was streaming in Australia."
"This time of the year is like an astronomical event for Australian entertainment. With the Arias just passed, soon the Aactas will be upon us once more; the red carpet season leading to celebrity dry-cleaning bills the size of a senator’s personal helicopter account. The Oscars might have Billy Crystal, and nobody does a musical number like the American music awards, but there’s something about an Australian gong-fest that really sets the heartstrings humming. Whether it’s Bert Newton doing his best comedy club material to fill time between Logies, anarchic performances of hit singles at the Arias, or a Brownlow red carpet fashion mishap, we all remember ‘those’ moments when Australia’s music/film/TV/sports industry got together to fete itself and came off like a school eisteddfod. Test your knowledge of Australian nights of nights with this quiz – no prizes, but it’s an honour just to be nominated."

"Australian live performers will begin the new year with no safety net, as extreme weather, further disruptions from Covid-19 and rising costs threaten the viability of the peak festival season. Meanwhile, the federal government’s $22m scheme designed to provide Covid insurance for live events was redundant before it had a chance to kick in and there appears to be nothing in the pipeline to replace it over the summer. More than a dozen music festivals have been cancelled this year due to heavy rain and storms brought on by La Niña weather patterns, including Strawberry Fields in the Riverina, The Grass is Greener in Canberra and Geelong, Bendigo’s Almost Summer and both This That festivals in New South Wales and Queensland. The first day of Splendour in the Grass in Byron Bay was cancelled after a washout and Wollongong’s Yours and Owls was cancelled altogether. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning With warnings mounting over a new Covid wave in the new year and the Bureau of Meteorology not predicting an end to La Niña until late summer, the live performance and festival sector has been left crippled – with no return to normal in sight. ‘Festivals we know and love may not survive’ In late September the federal government announced a $22m live performance support fund, allowing event organisers to access coverage in the event of cancellations due to Covid between November and February 2023. But the fund only applied to events affected by mandatory isolation requirements – so when the national cabinet agreed in early October to end isolation requirements, the insurance scheme was rendered irrelevant. Along with threats of bad weather and an ongoing pandemic, the Australian Festival Association (AFA) said the industry faced the start of 2023 with a 30% rise in supplier costs, inconsistent advanced ticket sales compared with pre-Covid patterns and a hike in insurance premiums by as much as 300%. “The festivals that we know and love may not survive if they don’t have a successful first season back after Covid,” the association’s managing director, Mitch Wilson, told the Guardian. “They’ve struggled to stay alive.” Despite being axed in early October, the $22m insurance fund was still counted as money spent to support the arts in the 2022 federal budget delivered on 25 October, some two weeks after the scheme had been abandoned. Neither the arts minister, Tony Burke, nor his department would respond to the Guardian’s queries about why funding for a defunct support scheme was included in the 2022 budget. A spokesperson from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications and the Arts said in a statement that Labor had made good an election promise to provide cover for live performance adversely affected by Covid. “In line with national cabinet’s decision to end mandatory Covid-19 isolation periods from 14 October, industry can now proceed with events such as plays, concerts and festivals with confidence and without the need to access pandemic-related coverage from the commonwealth,” the statement said. “The government is carefully considering future funding decisions ahead of the May 2023 federal budget, including any reallocation of unexpended funds.” Calls grow to flood-proof outdoor festivals An early December poll of 1,107 young people in five marginal NSW electorates conducted by the United Workers Union found that more than 40% of voters aged 18-24 wanted the NSW government to offer public funding to help flood-proof outdoor music events. Just over 20% believed it was not a government responsibility. Union director Karma Lord said the live music industry had been “smashed” by years of repressive lockout laws, hostile planning regulations and Covid. “Outdoor music festivals are a rite of passage for young people, but in 2022 we saw just how vulnerable they are to extreme weather events like floods,” she said. “Young people see taxpayer money used to gold-plate arts and sports infrastructure aimed at older generations and they want a fair share of public funding for events that matter to them.” Wilson said mid-2023 could be too late for many events and financial assistance at both state and federal levels was needed now. “I think there’s a lot of goodwill from the new government … but we’ve gone to Canberra to say, ‘look, we’re facing immediate challenges here, we need immediate help’.” Live Performance Australia has also been lobbying the government, with both it and AFA pleading to have a purpose-built scheme to cover weather-driven cancellations. Wilson said it was impossible to quantify the financial losses incurred across the industry due to extreme weather events. “Those festivals lucky enough to be covered for weather-related events have seen some of their losses covered by insurance but it is extremely inconsistent,” he said. “It’s just not sustainable.”"

"The writer, broadcaster and satirist Victor Lewis-Smith, who has died aged 65 after a short illness, once climbed the scaffolding outside York Minster in the early hours of the morning. At the top, he stood on a ledge singing Qur’anic invitations to prayer, before being arrested for causing a public disturbance. Magistrates fined the then music undergraduate £20, and asked if he had anything to say. “Yes,” replied Lewis-Smith. “All my leftwing friends told me they were beaten up by the police when they were in custody. But nothing of the sort happened to me. What am I to tell them when we next meet?” If he had been asked for other offences to be taken into account, he could have cited an earlier performance of I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside on the minster’s organ. He was, among other things, an accomplished jazz pianist. However, he was best known as the London Evening Standard’s waspishly off-message TV critic for 15 years, from 1992, during which time he damned Ricky Gervais’s The Office, arguing that its editing could not hide “the vacuity of both dialogue and what passed for a plot”, while hailing Mrs Brown’s Boys: “Every scene brimmed over with so much innocent joy it’s hard to fathom why critics have accused the show of misogyny, homophobia, and even racism.” He was also a prolific columnist for publications including Time Out, the Mail on Sunday, Esquire and the Sunday Correspondent. In the last of these he, along with his longtime collaborator Paul Sparks, claimed that the children’s TV show Captain Pugwash was peopled with characters called Master Bates, Seaman Staines and Roger the Cabin Boy. It wasn’t. Nor was it true that another children’s programme, Mary, Mungo and Midge, had a title that “would shock any scholar steeped in Chaucerian slang”, as the pair alleged. For friends and admirers, Lewis-Smith was a heroically scabrous cultural disruptor. For foes and detractors, however, whether those who filled letters pages with complaints, or celebrities who sued for libel, he was something else. In 2006 Gordon Ramsay obtained a £75,000 payout after suing over a Lewis-Smith review in the Evening Standard accusing the chef and his production company of “gastronomic mendacity”, wrongly claiming they had fabricated culinary disasters for the TV show Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares. In the same year, Paul McKenna sued the Mirror over a 2003 article claiming the hypnotist’s La Salle University doctorate was a sham. Lewis-Smith wrote: “I discovered that anyone could be fully doctored by La Salle within months … just so long as they could answer the following question correctly: ‘Do you have 2,615 dollars, Sir?’” McKenna told the court that Lewis-Smith had made him a “laughing stock” and was awarded damages of £25,000, the judge finding that he had not been dishonest. Lewis-Smith was also a virtuosic hoaxer. In 1996, he impersonated Stephen Hawking during an 18-minute phone call to Diana, Princess of Wales, using the same voice technology as the professor. When he asked about “Wills’s welfare”, Diana replied: “Oh, he’s doing very well at Eton.” The fake Hawking replied: “No, I meant Will Carling.” At the time, it was alleged that Diana had had an affair with the then England rugby captain. Lewis-Smith only released a clip of the call in 2015, when it was aired on Radio 4 Extra. Born in Essex, Lewis-Smith grew up in Chadwell Heath, the son of a surgeon, but never publicly disclosed details of his family. He did his A-levels at Barking College of Technology, then began his broadcasting career at Radio Medway before studying music at York University in the late 1970s. In the early 80s, after having worked on BBC Radio York’s Snooze Button, Lewis-Smith began working as a Radio 4 producer on Start the Week and Midweek. The Midweek host Libby Purves reportedly threw a chair at him for inviting a “dwarf thrower” as a guest. It is not clear what Purves threw at him when, in 1986, Lewis-Smith hired Arthur Mullard, the endearingly gormless Cockney star of such comedies as Yus, My Dear and Adventures of a Plumber’s Mate, as a stand-in presenter. The BBC’s listeners’ complaints log filled up and Lewis-Smith received one of many official memoranda, this time from David Hatch, then controller of Radio 4, which concluded: “Consider this a serious slapped wrist.” Instead, he quit. “I was getting bored with Midweek anyway,” he said. “If I had booked a drug-dealing Mexican junkie who came into the studio on a Harley-Davidson, Libby would have had him knitting a jersey in the corner by the end of the show.” He went on to develop a comedy-writing collaboration with Sparks, a fellow former York music student. The pair worked on pieces in which layers of music and special effects were woven around schoolboy japes and lavatorial gags. Their first commission was in the late 80s on Radio 4’s Loose Ends. “We worked for days on [those] pieces,” Lewis-Smith recalled. “At BBC rates it worked out at about 30p an hour.” Making surreal radio adverts for clients such as the Midland Bank proved more lucrative. However, the Loose Ends pieces led to them being commissioned to make the Victor Lewis-Smith Radio 1 show, which won best comedy radio programme in the 1990 British Comedy Awards, though also got them another wrist-slapping. “Dinner party sketch all right,” read a management dispatch. “Though I would have preferred not to have it so near the front of the programme in view of the graphic description of the turd with the sweetcorn on top of it.” “It is funny,” Lewis-Smith reflected. “They say they want dangerous radio, but they would prefer it not to be actually dangerous.” His first TV work was in 1989 on the Channel 4 arts and music show Club X, presenting a segment called Buygones, which featured droll meditations on cancelled consumer items such as the Aztec chocolate bar. In 1990, he acquired the rights to the Associated Rediffusion Productions Limited name, under whose aegis he made satirical programmes including TV Offal (Channel 4, 1997-98). One segment, called Honest Obituary, featured devastatingly critical death notices of living people whom Lewis-Smith did not care for, including Noel Edmonds and Vanessa Feltz. The show also aired the infamous “twangers” episode of the pre-schooler TV show Rainbow, which was made by the cast and crew as a joke and was never meant to be aired, as it featured Bungle, Zippy and Geoffrey communicating entirely in filthy double entendres. This was followed by Ads Infinitum (BBC Two, 1998-2000), on which Lewis-Smith ridiculed old TV and cinema commercials. But he could also do serious work. He was an executive producer for the Sky Arts series In Confidence (2010-14), consisting of one-to-one interviews by his friend Laurie Taylor with such luminaries as André Previn, Richard Dawkins and Kathy Burke. His last production for Sky Arts, Hitler’s Jazz Band, was screened on 14 December. For 30 years Lewis-Smith compiled Private Eye’s Funny Old World column. He was also a restaurant critic, including, briefly, for the Guardian, for whom he reviewed L Manze’s pie and mash shop in 2003: “I’ve only just started in this job and I’m already becoming a fat bastard, as was brought home to me forcefully when I struggled to extricate myself from the narrow bench table, having just consumed an order of double pie and triple mash, and left the premises high on carbs, filled with self-loathing. I’ve let Dr Atkins down, I’ve let you down and, most of all, I’ve let myself down.” He hadn’t though, not really. Lewis-Smith is survived by his wife, Virginia (nee Duff), and his daughter, Lucia. • Victor Lewis-Smith, writer, broadcaster and producer, born 12 May 1957; died 10 December 2022"
"Seth Meyers Seth Meyers looked into the billion-dollar collapse of crypto exchange FTX on Wednesday evening, following the arrest of founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas on Monday. Bankman-Fried (also known as SBF), “a guy who looks the way Cheeto dust smells”, Meyers joked, is charged with defrauding customers out of billions of dollars in a massive years-long fraud. “Oh, are billions of dollars missing? Have you checked the fanny pack where his weed dealer keeps all his tips?” Meyers said, referring to SBF’s standard appearance of T-shirt, cargo shorts and unkempt hair. “I can’t believe this guy thought he could hide out in the Bahamas,” Meyers said. “Usually when you think of international fugitive, you imagine a stylish jewel thief, not a guy in a T-shirt that clearly came out of a cannon at a basketball game. Dude was supposed to be a billionaire but he looks like he was thrown naked into a Goodwill and given 90 seconds to get dressed.” Meyers marveled at the staggering financial mismanagement of FTX: John Ray III, the man brought in to clean up FTX after its bankruptcy filing, said never in his career had he seen “such a complete failure of corporate controls and such complete absence of trustworthy financial information”. Ray, who also took over Enron after its collapse in 2001, believed FTX fell apart because a “very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals” running the company “failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls” required to handle people’s money. “You know it’s bad when even the guy who had to clean up the Enron scandal is horrified,” said Meyers. “The only way this could get any worse is if you found out, I don’t know, one of the key proponents of the Iraq war was somehow connected to …oh,” he added over a photo of Bankman-Fried at a conference with Tony Blair. “Why did it take until now for someone to figure out that this dude was grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated?” he wondered. “Wasn’t it nice when con artists put a little more thought into their outfits?” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert examined a new poll which found that in a hypothetical primary, Republican voters preferred Ron DeSantis to Donald Trump, 52% to 38%. “It’s hard to know who to root for here,” he said. “It’s like a poll between gonorrhea and a slightly more racist gonorrhea. “With the insurrections and the Hitler dinners, only the most conservative are still backing the ex-president, while DeSantis is trouncing him with voters who consider themselves only ‘somewhat’ conservative,” Colbert explained. “Basically, the folks who don’t support gay marriage, but think Andy Cohen does a great job handling those housewives.” “So to take full command of the GOP, all DeSantis has to do is reel in the coveted conservative demographic of angry conspiracy QAnon all-meat diet tan your testicle boys,” he added. And the Florida governor’s “opening offer” to that crowd was calling for a grand jury investigation of Covid vaccines. “You stupid mother-Pfizer,” said Colbert. “You want an investigation? Let me save you some time and money: in the US alone, the Covid vaccines have saved more than 3 million lives and helped prevent 18.5 million hospitalizations.” “And because idiots in your party politicized the vaccine, almost twice as many Republicans died from Covid before the midterms than the Democrats. Y’all killed your own voters!” Colbert played a montage of footage in which DeSantis encouraged Floridians to get vaccines, testifying to their safety. “That’s evidence right there that it causes genetic side effects,” the host noted. “Because this guy used to promote the vaccine, but once he got it, he turned into a huge dick bag.” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked Trump’s latest attempt to salvage an already faltering 2024 presidential campaign. “He got a premature election and now he’s desperate to shift attention away from his waning popularity,” the host explained. On Wednesday, “rant-a-claus” posted on Truth Social that he would make a “major” announcement the following day. “The tan-of-steel posted ‘AMERICA NEEDS A SUPERHERO’” Kimmel laughed. “What could it be? Maybe he got liposuction? Maybe Eric learned to tie his shoes? Who knows?” In other news, newly Elon Musk-owned Twitter reportedly hasn’t paid rent on its offices for weeks. “Of all the problems I would’ve guessed the second richest man in the world would have, paying rent wasn’t one of them,” Kimmel said. “Maybe he should change the name from Twitter to Squatter. Maybe he finally read the Art of the Deal and now he’s doing it Trump style.”"
"Slap on the suncream, don your sunglasses and head to your nearest Boxpark to be showered in overpriced pilsner: the World Cup is here in … wait, November?! That pint hurled at you isn’t going to feel nearly as pleasant in single digit temperatures, is it? These are strange times and a strange World Cup, happening out of season in a nation state the size of Yorkshire, and with as much attention (rightly) focused on the human rights violations of its host as on the football itself. Its moral murkiness notwithstanding, I am tentatively looking forward to the tournament, particularly as Wales are making their first appearance in the tournament in 64 years (waka, waka, eh, eh)! Still, I do sympathise with those who are desperate to skirt the thing, because that is going to be harder than ever. Usually the World Cup’s position smack-bang in the middle of summer means the football-loathers can at least head out into the sunshine to avoid it. In winter there’s no such escape. In its early stages this World Cup will cram in four matches a day, pretty much uninterrupted from 10am to 9pm, and that’s without accounting for highlights programmes, news reports and features packages on the One Show where they have a border collie predict how far England will go. Oh, and a prominent position on the Guardian homepage (Though, remember, there is a hide button). But the Guide is here for you, dear football-averse reader. We’ve selected a clutch of series currently available on streaming that are each lengthy enough to distract you for the duration of the tournament. We’ve avoided those obvious magnum opus series that we’re all familiar with (though much respect to anyone who is planning to spend the next month rewatching The Wire for the 3rd/4th/87th time), and instead have opted for some ever-so-slightly more under-the-radar shows, all of which lasted for four seasons or more. That should see you right through to the final on 18 December … *** Better Things Where can I watch it? iPlayer How much is there? 5 series, 52 episodes Pamela Adlon’s semi-autobiographical series about an actor trying to juggle work and raising/placating her three complex daughters is the Netherlands ‘74 team of the comedy world: it never got the garlands its brilliance deserved (its final series aired earlier this year to limited fanfare). Few shows have managed to feel so lived-in, never succumbing to cliche, every character beat seeming both unexpected and entirely earned. Oh and it’s really, really funny too. *** The Sinner Where can I watch it? Netflix How much is there? 4 series, 32 episodes Even if the World Cup was on 24/7, it still would struggle to match the glut of detective dramas on our screens. But this murder mystery anthology distinguishes itself from the pack through its distinctive premise – each season Bill Pullman’s detective looks into a murder committed by an unlikely culprit – and surprising plotting. If you only have time to watch one series, make it the brilliant second one where Pullman investigates the case of a child who has ‘fessed to poisoning his parents. *** Brassic Where can I watch it? Sky/NowTV How much is there? 4 series, 28 episodes Is there a more unashamedly fun show on British TV at the moment than Brassic? Part Shameless, part Guy Ritchie caper, it recently ended its fourth series with the same boisterous enthusiasm as it began its first. Whether its greyhound racing or classic car theft, Joe Gilgun and his clan of bad lads approach the task with the same droll outlook, eyebrow permanently raised. A fifth series is coming next year. *** The Venture Bros Where can I watch it? All 4 How much is there? 7 series, 86 episodes The best series ever made by gonzo cartoon channel Adult Swim, this long-running animated series started out as a fairly straightforward parody of boys-own adventures like The Hardy Boys and Jonny Quest and evolved into something far more interesting: a dizzying blend of complex plotting, off colour meta-humour and occasional meditations on human nature. It’s almost impossible to summarise the spy caper, so best to dive into the first episode and take it from there. *** Every Hugo Blick drama Where can I watch it? Various How much is there? 4 series Bewitched by The English, the Emily Blunt-starring revisionist western currently airing on BBC One/iPlayer? You should dive into the thoughtful, twisty and very stylish past works of its showrunner Hugo Blick. Crime thriller The Shadow Line (streaming on BritBox and UKTV Play) follows figures on both sides of the law during a murder investigation, the classy spy drama The Honourable Woman (UKTV Play), sees Maggie Gyllenhaal try to atone for her arms dealer father’s sins in the Middle East and Black Earth Rising (Netflix) teams up the unlikely duo of John Goodman and Michaela Coel for a drama about bringing war criminals to justice.

"Hello and welcome to the Guide helmed, in Gwilym’s absence, by me this week. As well as being the 62nd Guide to ever grace your inboxes, it is also one of six more editions before 2022 finally comes to an end (maybe it’s the constant flow of British prime ministers, but it does feel like it’s been going for a while now, right?). But just because the John Lewis ad is out, America is celebrating Thanksgiving and we’re about to be deluged by tinsel and Christmas films, don’t assume that culture is done and dusted. Below you’ll find some final music, TV and film releases to put in your diaries before the end of the year, before the business of end-of-year lists and – of course – looks ahead to 2023 begin. We’ve also got our book of the month, and all of our regular cultural goodness below. *** Music White Lung – Premonition 2 Dec, Domino Arriving a whole three years after it was originally slated, the fifth (and final) LP from Canadian punk rockers White Lung has been inspired by experiences as varied as motherhood, sobriety and the assorted political crises of the past few years. Expect snarlingly anthemic choruses, off-kilter melodies, and much raging against the machine from this swan song for the acclaimed three-piece. Nakhane – Leading Lines 16 Dec, BMG The new EP from the South African pop experimentalist, LGBTQ activist and all-round creative force (they’ve also moonlighted as a novelist and actor) is all about sensual and sumptuous delights, as singles including My Ma Was Good – high on 90s house theatrics – and the Perfume Genius-featuring, disco-inspired Do You Well have shown. If White Lung are liable to have you spoiling for a fight, Nakhane will surely have you making peace with the universe – and yourself. SZA – SOS Date TBC, RCA Almost a year after the release of the TikTok-fuelled breakup banger I Hate U – and with a clutch of recent features under her belt – it seems that SZA’s (above) extremely long-awaited follow-up to CTRL is almost here. “I’ll believe it when I see it”, you may well say, considering how the long rumours have been swirling, but it seems SOS will be arriving this side of 2023, with an SNL appearance set for 3 December. You officially have our permission to get excited. *** TV Litvinenko 9 Dec, ITVX David Tennant (above) is near-unrecognisable as he transforms into the bald, gaunt double of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, whose infamous death in London in 2006 put the subject of Russian poisonings into the public consciousness in Britain. The four-part drama comes at a time where Putin’s military operations are rarely out of the headlines, and is likely to prove a prescient study of geopolitical tensions. While you’re checking out ITV’s new streaming platform, do keep an eye out for Riches (22 Dec), which has been billed as the black, British answer to Succession. I Hate Suzie Too 20 Dec, Sky Atlantic/Now in the UK; 22 Dec, HBO Max in the US The first series of Billie Piper and Lucy Prebble’s dramedy – inspired in part by the former’s own experiences of adolescent stardom – was an anxiety-packed cocktail of tabloid-fuelled scandal, family breakdown, and dangerously spiralling emotions. This three-part follow-up sees Suzie seemingly on the up with a new reality TV gig – but will she get the public acclaim she so desires? Emily In Paris 21 Dec, Netflix No, wait, where are you going?! Stay with us for a minute ... Emily In Paris used to be hatewatch TV. You probably remember when it first aired and people started saying things like “oh my god, what has happened to TV” and “but why don’t any of these French people speak any French?” That is all, luckily, in the past, with the second series of the Lily Collins-fronted series defiantly cocking a snook at its protagonist and – quelle surprise – letting the français flow. Roll on season three. *** Film White Noise 30 Dec (Netflix) and selected cinemas Noah Baumbach, Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig. Are these three names not reason enough to think this might be the best sort-of-indie-but-totally-indie film you watch this year? If not, then perhaps the plot will help. This blackly comic adaptation of Don DeLillo’s 1985 novel sees Driver and Gerwig play a couple who flee their home after a freak accident with their band of children (because what doesn’t say “fun family roadtrip” like staring down the possibility of your impending death?) Sold! Avatar: The Way of Water 16 Dec This sequel to James Cameron’s epic sci-fi creature feature has been in development so long that it makes some of the aforementioned delays look positively minor (it was, for instance, supposed to be released three years before SZA’s first album came out). It’s finally here, however, and will be hoping to dazzle you with its spectacular CGI visuals (and so it ought to, as one of the most expensive films ever made). I Wanna Dance with Somebody 30 Dec in the UK; 21 Dec in the US Naomi Ackie (above) has come a long way from her TV debut in a 2015 episode of Doctor Who, and is now the star of this Whitney Houston biopic, which also sees Stanley Tucci take a break from eating delicious food on TV to play music biz supremo Clive Davis. As she transforms into the pop legend (complete with Houston’s original vocals), can it rival the (surprisingly emotional) Elvis in the music biopic stakes, or will it be a glossy karaoke session?

"Bedtime Story, by Chloe Hooper Simon &amp; Schuster Chloe Hooper’s talent for piercing the beating heart of a story is turned inwards in this beautifully rendered and very personal book about how to talk about death with her young children, after discovering their father had an aggressive form of cancer. Hooper’s tone is pitch-perfect with subject matter that could easily slide into sentimentality as she turns to the canon of children’s literature for wisdom – and assistance. With moody illustrations by Anna Walker, it’s a searching and magical work. – Lucy Clark Read more: Bedtime Story by Chloe Hooper review – an extraordinary treasure of hope and grief Homesickness, by Janine Mikosza Ultimo Press Janine Mikosza presents her stunning memoir as a long conversation between two warring halves of herself: the memoirist Janine, who wants to understand the violence that happened to her as a child; and the subject Jin, by turns antagonistic, tight-lipped, acerbic and unsure. The traumatised brain can blur the relationship between reality and memory, and here Mikosza tries to unpick it: revisiting – and literally mapping out – the 14 houses she lived in before she turned 18, some of which have rooms she is thankful to have forgotten. – Steph Harmon Read more: ‘I didn’t want to make public my suffering’: Janine Mikosza on reinventing the trauma memoir People Who Lunch, by Sally Olds Upswell People Who Lunch comprises intelligent, emotionally honest and chic essays about capital, community and pleasure, and how we broker our relationships to all those. Sally Olds reminds us art is political; leisure time is political; romantic arrangements are political. She roots her explorations firmly in place – in Flagstaff Gardens; or on Elizabeth Street, once a tributary of Birrarung , where “you can still hear the water gurgling beneath you” – with a laconic curiosity about investment in our social world. This bold debut recently sold in the US: watch this space. – Imogen Dewey A Brief Affair, by Alex Miller Allen &amp; Unwin When academic Frances Egan has a one-night stand in China, I thought Alex Miller was setting up A Brief Affair as a conventional story of middle-aged adultery. But the “Mongolian warrior” cracks open her life in more complex, philosophical ways. Miller writes confidently about women’s inner lives and examines Frances’s growth against her marriage to a good man, her stultifying career, and her fascination with residents of a former asylum. A wise, atmospheric novel from a master. – Susan Wyndham Read more: A Brief Affair by Alex Miller review – a moving study of female passion This Devastating Fever, by Sophie Cunningham Ultimo Press Alice is writing a book about Leonard Woolf. Alice has been writing a book about Leonard Woolf for 20 years. This Devastating Fever (which took Sophie Cunningham a similar amount of time to write) is a book about an impossible book, a metafiction of sorts – but it’s also a meditation on how to live in a world that is ending, on the complexities of care and love, and survival, continuing on. And it’s great fun – bold, cheeky, playfully energetic and utterly distinctive. – Fiona Wright Read more: Sophie Cunningham on the ‘crazy challenge’ of bringing Leonard and Virginia Woolf to life Faith, Hope and Carnage, by Nick Cave and Seán O’Hagan Text Publishing In the stasis of lockdown, longtime friends Nick Cave (of the Bad Seeds and Grinderman) and Seán O’Hagan began to record their conversations. From those hours of wild and generous talk, O’Hagan has extracted an extraordinary dialogue. It’s hard to improve upon Rachel Clark’s description of this book: “a lament, a celebration, a howl, a secular prayer”. Faith, Hope and Carnage demands to be heard. Get the audiobook and surrender to Cave’s ferocious eloquence, his creative velocity. – Beejay Silcox Read more: ‘Songs are little dangerous bombs of truth’: Nick Cave and Seán O’Hagan – an exclusive book extract Harold Holt, by Ross Walker Black Inc I found myself consistently delighted with the nuggets of information Ross Walker unearthed about our 17th prime minister, who I knew shamefully little about before beyond the exceptional circumstances of his death. The good-natured extrovert who loved parties but sought solitude in the sea; who loved ballet and ballroom dancing; the lifelong swimmer who would practice holding his breath while bored in parliament; the kind-hearted man who “argued with a smile”. Walker’s book – “a midway point between biography and narrative nonfiction – history told as a story,” as he puts it – is eminently readable, never getting distracted with breathlessly reciting names and dates in the way some political biographies can. A real treat. – Sian Cain An Exciting and Vivid Inner Life, by Paul Dalla Rosa Allen and Unwin Comme, Paul Dalla Rosa’s breakout work – nominated for the world’s richest short story prize in 2019 – is a tale of despairing desire and suffocating anxiety set in Melbourne’s scariest store. It appears in his first collection alongside nine other stories of claustrophobia: terrible people subjected to the churn of work while blinkered by their own obsessions – fame, wealth, a life-altering rebrand. With caustic wit, Dalla Rosa performs a kind of surgery on his characters, splitting them wide open to reveal something exciting and vivid, ugly and depraved. – Michael Sun Read more: An Exciting and Vivid Inner Life by Paul Dalla Rosa review – deftly executed and cringingly funny Losing Face, by George Haddad UQP Losing Face should be a hard read, traversing the big themes of grief, toxic masculinity, identity and sexual assault. But instead it’s gripping, and absolutely full of heart. Joey and Elaine balance each other perfectly – both are gloriously flawed and full of life. At sentence level, Losing Face is full of evocative imagery, but it’s the characters that really make it a stand out, and the thrill of being invited to snoop on the intimate realities of a family falling apart. – Bec Kavanagh Read more: Losing Face by George Haddad review – a rich, complex story of consent and coming of age Nothing Bad Ever Happens Here, by Heather Rose Allen and Unwin It would’ve been so easy for Heather Rose to take the events of her life and write a straightforward “trauma memoir” – a genre publishers can’t get enough of. In her hands it would have still been a great book – but instead she has written something truly original. This is journey through her physical life, yes – true tragedy, ghosts, heroin! – but in tandem is the journey through her spiritual life. You finish feeling so much more open to the world, even braver, after spending such intimate time with Rose. – Bridie Jabour Read more: Heather Rose on overcoming tragedy and choosing to live a happy life Seeing Other People, by Diana Reid Ultimo Press As witty and compelling as her first novel, Love and Virtue, Diana Reid’s Seeing Other People focuses on two Sydney sisters in their 20s: the older Eleanor, sharp and together, who fiercely values her own intelligence and integrity; and the younger Charlie, beautiful and sensitive, an actor on the rise. The novel is fascinated by questions of morality, truth and self-perception (or, rather, deception). Vivid with hot beach days and tangled romantic relationships, it’s a great summer read. – Donna Lu Read more: Diana Reid on Sally Rooney, Love &amp; Virtue and her fast follow-up: ‘Lockdown gave me freedom to fail’ Our Members Be Unlimited, by Sam Wallman Scribe The history of unionism is laid out in eye-popping colour in the first longform work by comics journalist and labour activist Sam Wallman – who also details his time working at an Amazon warehouse in Melbourne. It’s confronting seeing just how much the global giant exploits vulnerable people. Communicating Wallman’s clear-eyed vision for a better world, this is a great starting point to unionism, and a reminder for those more seasoned of why we continue to fight. – Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen Read more: ‘Pissing while walking is tricky’: inside an Amazon warehouse, a cartoonist tries to unionise Animals With Human Voices, by Damen O’Brien Recent Work Press Brisbane poet Damen O’Brien is an obscenely talented fellow; in the last decade, he’s scooped up nearly every poetry prize in the country. But his debut collection is so much more than the sum of its well-acclaimed parts – it’s a missive from the post-Anthropocene dark. Our narrators are world-weary jellyfish, apocalyptic goats, God-fearing earthworms and fossil prophets: a creaturely chorus. Is O’Brien’s volume an elegy or a verdict? Both. It’s also a marvel. – Beejay Silcox We Come With This Place, by Debra Dank Echo publishing This book is difficult to pin down. It’s memoir, certainly, retelling Debra Dank’s life – but it goes further back, to her Gudanji/Wakaja parents and ancestors; and then back still to creation stories she generously shares. Dank describes it as “a strange kind of letter, written to my place”; Tara June Winch called it “a jewel of a book”, filled with heaviness and warmth. To inhabit this vivid place is to be invited into a new understanding of country, culture, family and time. It stuck with me. – Steph Harmon Read more: We Come With This Place by Debra Dank review – a jewel to rival Australia’s great desert memoirs Moon Sugar, by Angela Meyer Transit Lounge I loved this surreal psychological trip. Angela Meyer is consistently pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in genre fiction and it’s genuinely exciting to read. On the surface, Moon Sugar is a book about the possibility of magic, but underneath it’s about truth. Mila and Josh feel so genuinely stuck, and after the last few years, who isn’t looking deep for the things that make you feel alive? Meyer’s latest is life in full, vibrant hyper-colour. – Bec Kavanagh Read more: Moon Sugar by Angela Meyer review – blending the wonder of fantasy with the thrill of crime fiction Train Lord, by Oliver Mol Penguin Random House Like his alt-lit forebears, Oliver Mol’s writing can often feel like alchemy, constructing brief, glimmering moments of catharsis from the meandering absurdities of life. Train Lord is less a memoir than a collection of these absurdities – chief among them his chronic, year-long migraine, which robbed him of writing, reading, existing in the world. Surveying the detritus of his life, he becomes a guard for Sydney Trains, surrendering to stasis – and finding within it a tale of brutal self-awareness and surprising joy. – Michael Sun Read more: Oliver Mol on surviving a 10-month migraine: ‘If I didn’t tell this story it would rot inside me’ Jesustown, by Paul Daley Allen &amp; Unwin It’s always a relief when a friend and colleague’s book isn’t terrible, but it is true joy when it is genuinely fantastic. I was gripped by Daley’s colonial novel which follows Patrick Renmark, a white pop historian, as he returns to the mission his grandfather lived on. The men at the centre of the novel are deeply flawed, and there is no neat redemption. But the excavation of their inner lives along with Australia’s history is compelling, and at times very moving. – Bridie Jabour Read more: Black-white history: the shared responsibility of writing about colonisation’s bitter legacy The Sun Walks Down, by Fiona Macfarlane Allen and Unwin What I love most about this book is its unabashed passion: how each of its characters is overtaken, at times, by an imagination and longing grand enough to transform everything around them. Its narrative centres on a child, lost in the landscape – but Fiona Macfarlane uses this old trope to explore the always-hidden but deeply felt inner lives of her townsfolk, and builds a world sensitive, luminous and tinged with magic. – Fiona Wright Shirley Hazzard: A Writing Life, by Brigitta Olubas Hachette Australian-born Shirley Hazzard wrote only four novels – The Transit of Venus her literary triumph – as well as short stories and nonfiction. But her output was expansive in ambition, vision and style. She deserves every page of this insightful biography by Australian scholar Brigitta Olubas, who elegantly reweaves the facts and fictions of Hazzard’s emotional and intellectual life, tracing her determined rise from the doldrums of postwar Sydney to the cultural heights of New York and Italy. – Susan Wyndham Read more: Shirley Hazzard: A Writing Life by Brigitta Olubas review – doyenne of love and devastation Cold Enough for Snow, by Jessica Au Giramondo This slim book about a mother and daughter’s overseas trip feels like a cool tonic. At first glance it doesn’t do much, plot-wise. But these quiet scenes from a journey through Japan weave around subtle and often troubling questions about family, memory, self-expression – and power, both interpersonal and artistic. The narrator’s relatable anxieties about meaning and the possibility (or not) of mutual understanding are alloyed by the limpid beauty of Jessica Au’s writing. A novella of weather, texture and light – delicate and enigmatic. – Imogen Dewey Read more: Cold Enough for Snow by Jessica Au review – a graceful novella about how we pay attention All That’s Left Unsaid, by Tracey Lien HarperCollins Sydney-born, New York-based Tracey Lien uses 1990s Cabramatta as the setting for her compelling, complex debut novel, which follows a cadet journalist as she investigates her teenage brother’s murder in a busy restaurant. The impacts of the model minority myth and the ripple effects of intergenerational trauma are central, and Lien inhabits multiple character perspectives with empathy and intelligence. This masterful storytelling cuts to the heart of the Vietnamese diaspora community, still in mourning half a century later. – Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen Collective Movements Monash University Collective Movements is a First Nations anthology, a dialogue and a history of creative practices in south-east Australia. Collecting together different threads, from ILBIJERRI and Kaiela Arts to this mob, it weaves tactile, political transmissions with physical, geographical and historical movements. Like much Black publishing, Collective Movements is not intended to be easily categorisable; the book’s several contributors are working in ways that go beyond categories of European history and classification. Beautifully designed, it is a significant record – one everybody should read. – Declan Fry The Settlement, by Jock Serong Text Publishing Australian history has been overly generous to George Augustus Robinson, who in the 1830s enticed some of the supposedly last “wild” Tasmanians to vacate their traditional lands for a windswept island settlement. Robinson, named in Jock Serong’s The Settlement only as “the Man”, is at the vanguard of a failed and cruel colonial experiment as this celebrated novelist eloquently portrays it. To the settlement’s confined, Serong invests appropriate human dignity denied by their oppressors and their history. – Paul Daley The Most Important Job in the World, by Gina Rushton Pan Macmillan In The Most Important Job in the World, journalist Gina Rushton grapples with the climate crisis and what “we owe to the planet when it comes to adding another human to it”. Rushton interrogates whether or not she wants to have children – a question informed by extensive and compassionate reporting. The book is a limpid and compelling consideration of reproductive rights and justice, the physical and emotional labour of parenting, and both individual choice and collective responsibility. – Donna Lu Read more: As a science journalist I’m reconsidering having kids. I’m not the only one Denizen, by James McKenzie Watson Penguin Random House The word “thriller” seems inadequate – and perhaps a bit reductionist – for this unsettling psychological minefield. Tense, savage, compelling and deeply disturbing, Watson’s debut weaves between the childhood and young adulthood of its protagonist, Parker, who from a young age understands there is something very wrong with his brain. Mental health issues, tortured family relationships and high stakes friendships against the brutal backdrop of modern rural Australia – with a frighteningly unreliable narrator – means you’ll have a tight grip on this one right until the horrifying end. – Lucy Clark Read more: His dark materials: the bush noir that grapples with mental health Which Australian books did you love this year?

"A museum in London run by the Wellcome foundation health charity is to close one of its key galleries because it perpetuates “a version of medical history that is based on racist, sexist and ableist theories and language”. The Wellcome Collection’s announcement on Saturday affects a free permanent display called Medicine Man, which includes objects relating to sex, birth and death and includes anatomical models in wood, ivory and wax dating back to the 17th century. These were collected by Sir Henry Wellcome who amassed more than a million items on the history of health and medicine. “The very fact that these items have ended up in one place, the story we told was that of a man with enormous wealth, power and privilege,” the museum said on Twitter. The announcement was welcomed by some Twitter followers but attacked by several others. “An act of cultural vandalism to close without even having any idea of what will take its place,” wrote one. “Is there no one who can get rid of these cultural vandals instead or does the rot go all the way to the top? Is this the prelude to whole museums closing because their collections aren’t woke enough?” another asked. The director of the Wellcome Collection, Melanie Keen, was appointed in 2019. A year later she pledged to be courageous in dealing with the most contentious items on display there. “It feels like an impossible place to be worrying about this material we hold without interrogating what it is, what narratives there are to be understood in a more profound way, and how the material came to be in our collection,” she said. Keen highlighted one painting of a black African kneeling in front of a white missionary. “A Medical Missionary Attending to a Sick African” (1916) by Harold Copping, which she has since had put in storage on the grounds that it risked “perpetuating racial stereotypes and hierarchies”. Other interventions have been made since then but the latest announcement said the Medicine Man display “still perpetuates a version of medical history that is based on racist, sexist and ableist theories and language”. “When our founder, Henry Wellcome started collecting in the 19th century, the aim then was to acquire vast numbers of objects that would enable a better understanding of the art and science of healing throughout the ages. “The result was a collection that told a global story of health and medicine in which disabled people, Black people, Indigenous peoples and people of colour were exoticised, marginalised and exploited – or even missed out altogether. As a result we will close Medicine Man on 27 November 2022.”"
"Earlier this year, Eric Barone was approached by singer-songwriter Molly Rankin of power-pop group Alvvays. The game developer, best known as the one-man creative force behind the hit farming simulator Stardew Valley, was asked if he would like to contribute some art for the band’s new single, Many Mirrors. Never one to limit himself, or to do things by halves, Barone created a whole music video instead. “That’s just how I work,” he tells me. “I don’t hold back.” You can tell from his work that Barone puts the whole of himself into it. Now almost seven years old and still hugely popular, Stardew Valley is an extension of who he is. When you work on the graphics, the programming, the audio, the systems and the writing all at once, you project a fairly complete image of who you are on to the world. For some people that would be daunting, but Barone embraces it. “The reason that the music of Stardew Valley suits the game – that what you see and what you hear mesh so well – is because it’s all coming from me,” he says. “It’s cohesive, and the ‘something’ that knits it all together is me. It’s like you’re peering into my mind. Making art, making video games, is my way of sharing who I am with the world. My goal, deep down, is that I want to connect with the rest of humanity, and maybe have them connect with me in some way.” But Barone explains that he has only bared part of his soul to the world so far; Stardew Valley represents just one aspect of who he is. That’s why he’s driven to make more games, engage with more projects and make music videos for superstar indie bands, even though Stardew Valley has earned enough that he barely needs to work again. Stardew Valley has become an unofficial mascot for “cosy” gaming: low-stakes, low-peril interactive fun that offsets the gung-ho shoot-’em-ups that dominate the blockbuster side of the video game industry. And the soundtrack has racked up over 40m listens on Spotify: not bad for a game with roughly 20m sales. Interestingly, Barone has no musical training. “It was all intuitive,” he says. “It came from how the seasons feel, and transferring that into sound. I don’t know if that can really be taught. I’m glad people like the music and I’m glad Stardew Valley found its place as a more unique game – at least when it came out – given that it is more relaxed, less aggressive, more casual and accessible, and just made people feel good. The soundtrack accompanies that. Modern life is crazy, people are looking for refuge or respite from everything that’s going on. They can find that in Stardew Valley, and its music.” Barone says he thinks there’s something therapeutic in the game’s sound, and I agree. Even the more downbeat tracks, referencing a “melancholy fall” or a “lonely winter”, have an optimistic undertone. And that’s intentional. “Everything in Stardew is done by feeling,” explains Barone. “When I’ve explained these tracks as ‘lonely’ or ‘melancholy’, I didn’t mean that in a negative way: there’s beauty in loneliness, there’s a beauty in the melancholy of the seasons. Especially the darker seasons. I see these things as awe-inspiring, not negative.” Though fall may be less jaunty than summer, winter more minor-key than spring, there’s always beauty in the songs that play. Winter (Nocturne of Ice) takes its name from a classical piece inspired by the night. Originally the music for Stardew Valley was a lot more “video game-y”, says Barone, and used sounds from the SNES so it could “sound like a Super Nintendo Harvest Moon game”. But he decided to move away from that in the end. He lifted the music up alongside the graphics, making it more orchestral and realistic – though it retains some of that video-game feeling in the synths and digital sounds that permeate the soundscape. The music is timed so that you only hear a few tracks per day, breaking up the ambient noise of babbling brooks, birdsong and leaves rustling in the trees because, says Barone, if it’s rarer, it makes it more special when you do hear it. As great video game music always does, these songs amplify what you, the player, are doing at any given time, swaddling you more completely in the game’s world. Barone’s favourite track in the game, Dance of the Moonlight Jellies, accompanies a significant moment in any player’s experience of Stardew Valley: a night-time festival where townspeople gather to watch a jellyfish migration. Coming at the end of the summer season, it marks the point at which you’re really starting to understand the social and mechanical nuances of the game. “It’s something I keep coming back to when I think of the music in Stardew Valley,” Barone tells me, “because it’s a very special and emotional moment in the game and I think it’s really touching.” The Dance of the Moonlight Jellies – an event you could easily miss, one that offers no rewards – is a calm moment of unity, beauty and serenity in a world that is otherwise quite demanding of your time; a midnight oasis that gives you space to sit back and enjoy the music. It’s a reflection of what Stardew Valley is all about, and what Barone set out to achieve. You can see why it’s his favourite track."
"Stephen Colbert Late-night hosts had a bevy of Donald Trump legal developments to process, starting with his federal trial for inciting the January 6 insurrection, in which he faces 91 felony charges. Trump’s lawyers have tried to avoid a trial by claiming that he has complete immunity from criminal prosecution for any alleged crimes committed in office. “Come on, the president can’t be free to commit any crime they want in office,” said Stephen Colbert on Tuesday’s Late Show. The judge in that case ruled against Trump, but his lawyers appealed the ruling, which could delay the trial indefinitely. Enter the special counsel Jack Smith, who on Monday asked the supreme court to decide on whether Trump has any immunity from criminal prosecution. “He wants to completely skip the appeals process,” Colbert explained. “It’s the legal equivalent of being on hold with the cable company and going ‘representative! representative!’ “Trump better hope he has immunity, because it sounds like Smith has a whole lot of evidence,” he continued, such as extracted and reviewed data from Trump’s phone. “Can you imagine being the witness who has to go through all of the data on Donald Trump’s phone?” Colbert mused. The data reportedly reveals details of Trump’s final weeks in office, including his daily movements and Twitter habits. “And we all know his Twitter habits happen in the same room as his daily movements,” Colbert quipped. The prosecution also sought to review Trump’s direct messages and draft tweets. “Wait a second, he has drafts of his tweets?” Colbert wondered. “What could he possibly have typed that he wasn’t willing to immediately hit send on?” In other news, the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who was fired from the network in April “for somehow being too racist”, and started a show on Twitter, but now has “an even worse idea”: a subscription streaming service. Membership to Tucker Carlson Network will cost $9 a month. “Now, that seems steep, but there is a free version,” Colbert noted. “For $0 a month, you can never watch Tucker Carlson again.” According to the website, the network will include interviews with such figures as Kid Rock, Martin Shkreli, Alex Jones and RFK Jr, “collectively known as Mount Douchemore”, Colbert quipped. Jimmy Kimmel The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was in Washington DC on Tuesday to visit Joe Biden for support in the war against the Russian invasion. “This poor guy Zelenskiy is fighting for his life, he has to come here and beg these idiots for money,” Jimmy Kimmel noted. Zelenskiy also stopped by the Capitol to meet with Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell. “What a threesome,” said Kimmel of the photo-op. “It’s like an elderly same-sex couple showing their nephew around the country club.” Zelenskiy met with all 100 US senators on Tuesday to ask for additional funding for Ukraine and more humanitarian aid “and to show Ted Cruz how to grow a beard”, Kimmel quipped. The former president, meanwhile, was busy shilling his official trading cards, including some with his mugshot. “What is going on? This genius just reinvented Garbage Pail Kids,” Kimmel remarked. “He is the most shameless person in the history of the world, probably,” he added. “By summer, you’ll probably be able to buy his adult diapers out of a vending machine.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers addressed an apparent gaffe by Biden, when he accidentally referred to the Marine One presidential helicopter as “Air Force Helicopter One”. “You know what? I don’t even think that’s a gaffe,” said Meyers. “I think once you get to a certain age, you don’t care what stuff is called any more. It’s the same reason your dad calls Yellowstone ‘Yellowranch’. He doesn’t care!” Meyers also noted Zelenskiy’s meeting with the House speaker, Mike Johnson, before going to the White House to speak with Biden, “because in America it’s customary to go ask Dad when Mom says no”. On the Trump front, new evidence shows that the former president contacted a Mar-a-Lago employee who witnessed multiple incidents of his handling of classified documents and offered the worker legal representation and free tickets to an upcoming golf tournament. “Man, only Trump is lazy enough to bribe a witness with stuff he just has lying around,” Meyers laughed. And a new poll found that one in five registered voters said they would be open to supporting the presidential hopeful and conspiracy theorist Robert F Kennedy Jr, “and if Kennedy could just talk to some of those people, he could get it to one in 10”, Meyers joked."
"Frances Sternhagen, the Tony award-winning actor known for playing formidable women on stage in Driving Miss Daisy and on screen in Cheers, Misery and Sex and the City, has died at her home in New York. She was 93. Her son, John Carlin, confirmed her death on Instagram. “Frannie,” he wrote. “Mom. Frances Sternhagen. On Monday night, Nov 27, she died peacefully at her home, a month and a half shy of her 94th birthday … Fly on, Frannie. The curtain goes down on a life so richly, passionately, humbly and generously lived.” Sternhagen won two Tonys, both as featured actress in a play, for two very different roles: as Aunt Lavinia in the 1995 Broadway revival of The Heiress, based on the novel Washington Square by Henry James, and for multiple roles in The Good Doctor, Neil Simon’s 1973 take on Chekhov. But she was most recognizable to audiences outside Broadway for a number of memorable screen roles, including as Cliff Clavin’s mother in Cheers, Dr John Carter’s aristocratic grandmother on ER, and Trey MacDougal’s mother on Sex and the City. She garnered three Emmy nominations: two for Cheers and one for Sex and the City. More recently, she appeared as Kyra Sedgwick’s mother on the police procedural The Closer. Sternhagen also appeared in more than two dozen films, including Misery, Bright Lights, Big City, Julie &amp; Julia, The Hospital and 1983’s Independence Day. She received numerous Tony nominations over her illustrious stage career, including for On Golden Pond, Equus and Angel, and revivals of Morning’s at Seven and The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window. She was awarded a lifetime achievement Obie award in 2013. Born on 13 January 1930, Frances Hussey Sternhagen was the only child of John Meier Sternhagen, a United States tax court judge, and Gertrude (Wyckoff) Sternhagen, a first world war nurse turned homemaker. She attended the Potomac school and the Madeira school, both in Virginia, before matriculating at Vassar College. She initially studied history, but was persuaded by an adviser to try out drama. After graduation in 1951, Sternhagen briefly taught at Milton Academy in Massachusetts, and unsuccessfully auditioned for roles at the Brattle Street Theater in nearby Cambridge. She soon returned to Washington, took theater courses at the Catholic University of America and began appearing in Arena Stage productions. She made her New York stage debut at age 25 in Jean Anouilh’s Thieves’ Carnival at the Cherry Lane Theater. A year later, in 1956, she won her first Obie for The Admirable Bashville. She won again in 1965 for two performances, in The Room and A Slight Ache. Like many working actors, Sternhagen consistently booked small television roles, including on the soap opera Love of Live and numerous commercials. She continued working into her 80s; her final stage performance was in the off-Broadway play The Madrid at New York’s City Center, playing the mother of Edie Falco. Her final film role was as a wise, chain-smoking real estate agent in the 2014 comic drama And So It Goes with Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton. Sternhagen was married to Thomas Carlin, a fellow actor whom she first met at Catholic University, from 1956 until his death in 1991. She is survived by the couple’s six children: sons Tony, Paul, Peter and John; daughters Amanda Carlin Sanders and Sarah Carlin; nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."

"Frank Skinner has been up since 7.23am. “I don’t like dictatorial twelfths,” he says, showing me the list of alarms on his phone: 6.57am, 7.09am, 7.11am, 7.17am. We’re meeting at a photo studio in an industrial estate in north London. He’s already done the school run – Skinner had his first and only child with long-term partner Cath Mason in 2012, and Buzz is now 11 years old. They walked the dog across Hampstead Heath. “We’ve got a white cavapoo called Poppy,” Skinner goes on. “So it all works out quite neatly. The dog gets a walk, the kid gets to school, we don’t damage the planet. The maximum exercise I can do now is walking anyway.” Is Skinner feeling his age? He is 66 now and looks well, like a slightly older version of the Frank Skinner picture from telly: thin but healthy, grey hair not yet receding. But recently… “One thing I’ve noticed is that when I bite into an apple, I have to press down on the top of my head to get through,” he says. “I don’t have enough jaw strength.” He laughs the trademark Skinner chuckle, half discerning professor, half giggling school boy. “No one said to me, ‘You’ll reach a point where you’ll be using your skull like a hole punch.’” Time has been catching up with him in odd and surprising ways. “I was watching a football match and the commentator said, ‘They haven’t won on this ground since 1993.’ I thought: ‘What, yesterday?’ Then I realised that’s 30 years ago.” Skinner has been part of the nation’s fabric since he won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1991, beating Eddie Izzard and Jack Dee. For a decade between 1994 and 2004, he presented Fantasy Football League with then-housemate David Baddiel, which spawned one of the greatest football songs of all time: 1996’s Three Lions, which has been released with different lyrics four times. For a while in the 90s he had his own BBC1 show. He’s presented a documentary on Elvis (Skinner is a super-fan) and featured in an episode of Peter Capaldi’s Doctor Who. He was appointed an MBE in 2023’s New Year Honours. In February, Skinner will be performing 14 nights of his latest standup show, 30 Years of Dirt, in London. Which leaves Christmas to get past. I ask him how he’ll be spending the break. “My partner is very pro-Christmas, which is odd considering how morose she is the rest of the time. We’ll be going the full works: decorations, a tree… The biggest one they’ve got, obviously, which means I’ll have to cut the top off to get it into the house.” Christmas Day will be spent with the in-laws. “It’s one of my favourite times,” he goes on. “I think I’m at my best while dicing vegetables. There should be a chatshow where people dice vegetables. You’d get the best out of the guests.” Christmas is typically a time for getting merry, but Skinner has, famously, been sober for 30 years. He’s spoken of only clocking that he was an alcoholic when he swapped the first swig of the day from sherry to Pernod. I mention one of his standup jokes, where Skinner receives mild applause for announcing he hasn’t had a drink since 24 September 1986, age 29, before he’d even done a standup gig. “What a lovely response,” Skinner says on stage as the audience celebrate his abstinence. And then: “Can I just ask, what would your response have been if I said I haven’t had a wank since September 1986?” “I think if you gave most blokes the ultimatum, they’d give up the drink,” he laughs. I ask if he misses it. “I’m not really an adventurer,” he says. “I’m actually quite well behaved. In my drinking years, I had adventures every day. People think this means exciting sexual adventures, but it was never that. I’d meet some blokes on the bus and they’d say, ‘We’re going to Shrewsbury to smoke weed,’ and I’d say, ‘I’ll come with you.’ I liked the romantic feeling of people walking past me while I was queueing at the grocer’s at 7.50am to get sherry. As [playwright] Peter Shaffer says in Equus: ‘People worship at the altar of the great god Normal.’ I thought, ‘That’s what these people are, and I’m this maverick rebel figure.’” It’s easy to hear comedians joking from behind the tears of a clown. Skinner has spoken of the anxiety he experienced while starting out as a stone-cold-sober comic. But depression isn’t something Skinner’s really had to deal with. “A woman asked me if I’d ever suffered with depression. I said, ‘Oh yeah, I have.’ She said, ‘How long did it last?’ I said, ‘Probably an afternoon, when I just felt really miserable.’ “I often feel like a cork,” he continues. “Through alcoholism, the death of my parents, I’ve always remained buoyant, which has been a blessing. Having said that, I don’t think people who don’t drink will ever know how drink can utterly switch off anxiety, like the flick of a switch. I once went to join a library and thought, ‘I can’t just walk into a library sober, not knowing anyone.’ I went and had four pints and thought, ‘Now I feel confident.’ Alcohol didn’t haunt me. I just thought that was the way it was.” Skinner was born Christopher Graham Collins into a working-class Catholic family in West Bromwich, a faith he still follows. “Catholicism is a central part of my life, but I don’t preach it. It’s just incidental in my stories and my conversation,” he says. He was the youngest of four; the family grew up on a council estate. Going to university was rare among his family, but he went on to get a degree and a master’s in English. He’s always been proud of his roots. He chose the stage name Frank Skinner after a man in his dad’s pub dominoes team. I ask, “Was there pressure at home to get a proper job?” “Almost none,” he says. “My dad once said to me, ‘If I was you, I’d get on the bandwagon and get into show business.’ I would dress as a cowboy with a plastic guitar and do Elvis numbers. My dad would tap the telly and go: ‘One day, he’s going to be on this…’” After graduating, Skinner spent three years on the dole before going on to teach English at the Halesowen College of Further Education in the West Midlands. “Teaching is a lower strand of show business,” he says. “You’ve got your crowd and you want to entertain them.” It was the school’s head of drama who encouraged Skinner to make a break into show business, inviting him to take part in a play at Edinburgh. Which play exactly, Skinner forgets. What excited him was the standup that he saw for the first time, something he’d never seen back in Birmingham. “I was so excited that when I got back from Edinburgh, I phoned this place called the Tic Toe Theatre Company and said, ‘I want to book for next year.’ They said, ‘How long do you want to do?’ I said, ‘A couple of hours?’ ‘They said, ‘Nobody does that long – do an hour.’ I booked an hour at midday for however many days, which cost £420 and left me with £14 life savings in the post office.” He goes on, “For a while, I thought, I can make people laugh in the pub. I don’t need any practice. I’ll just turn up in Edinburgh and do it. But the same head of drama said, ‘I really think you should try a few gigs beforehand.’ So I did some gigs, and I was terrible.” “How terrible?” I ask. “My first gig was at the Portland Club in Birmingham, also home of the Birmingham Anglers Association. I knew there was this thing called alternative comedy, but still I didn’t know where it was in Birmingham. The second was on New Year’s Eve. I thought: I need to buy into the mainstream, so I started telling gags, but it was still just awful. An old woman walked to the front of the stage, looked up at me, shook her head with tremendous sorrow and walked away. It’s still one of the most nuanced heckles I’ve ever received. The third was in a small pub called the Ivy Bush in Edgbaston on an alternative night and I absolutely stormed it. After the gig, a beautiful woman came up to me and said, ‘God, you were brilliant. I suppose people tell you that all the time?’ What I didn’t say was, ‘No, you are the first person who’s ever said it.’ Once you’ve had one good gig, you’re off. I was hooked.” Skinner’s live stuff especially is famous for the sex stuff. In his latest show, he makes the bold move of leaving the knob gags at home. “Why?” I ask. “I have thought in recent years that that kind of material doesn’t command respect in lots of quarters – like at the Observer for example,” he says. “Doing a clean show removes the tension of the audience thinking, ‘Oh, I didn’t think it was going to be like this.’” But there’s always been more to Skinner than knob gags. My favourite joke, from Skinner’s standup in the 90s, is where he points out that if you stumble, you should style it out then look at your watch, to make it look deliberate. “I actually saw a bloke do that,” he says now. “Something I’ve realised is that I have little power of invention.” He brings up the second series of his 2004 sitcom, Shane, starring Skinner as a taxi driver, which was filmed but never broadcast. “My jokes all come from things that have happened to me, because I don’t seem to be able to make stuff up very well. If I could, I’d be on Netflix, and I wouldn’t have to try to prove myself as cool and intelligent…” David Baddiel has only recently apologised for repeatedly calling former Nottingham Forest striker Jason Lee a “pineapple head” on Fantasy Football League, in what now is considered racist bullying. Is there any other material Skinner is worried could come back and haunt him? “I don’t look back and think I’d be cancelled, so much as I wouldn’t do that now,” he says. “I still think what you feel is right is right. I don’t want to do anything on stage that I couldn’t defend. They’ve started showing some of my old standup on the telly and stuff arrives in the post – I mean emails – saying: ‘Can you watch this edit?’ and I just can’t watch it. Usually it’s because they need to edit it down, but I assume they’re also applying some sort of modern contemporary eye, which could make it a slim volume indeed. I’ve always been very anti-deliberately shocking. If I read the blurb on the back of another comic’s DVD and it describes them as ‘politically incorrect’, it makes me nauseous.” How political is he? “I don’t think very politically,” he says. “I vote Labour, because when I was a student, we went to No 10 back when you could get quite close, and James Callaghan waved to me. I thought: that’s my politics sorted. I voted to remain during Brexit because I like the idea of sitting outside a café in Paris smoking a Gauloises, not because I have any view on the economy. There’s only one thing worse than celebrities talking about politics and that’s politicians talking about anything other than politics. The question I get asked most, which you’ve resisted – well done – is how can you continue to do standup comedy with all this woke stuff? I don’t think woke is a negative thing at all. I watched the new Doctor Who and there’s a trans woman who is essential to the plot. Another character is in a wheelchair that fires missiles.” He goes on, “We were watching Strictly recently – the biggest show on television. Two men were dancing together and everybody loved it. I said to my son: ‘We are living in wondrous times. When I was your age, gay men in Birmingham would get beaten up in the street.’ This might sound a bit – if you don’t mind me saying – Observer, but I actually believe I’m at my most woke when I’m talking to my 11-year-old. I love that accepting difference is a concept that comes naturally to him, whereas I grew up as a quite bigoted, narrow-minded person who had to change when I got to my 20s.” I ask him how Skinner will be judged at the pearly gates. “I don’t think I could put my hand on my heart and say, ‘I’ve cracked it.’ But, as Henry Fielding describes Tom Jones in his big fat 18th-century novel… Tom Jones is shagging around, causing scandal, but he’s described as a good-natured man. And that’s what I’ve tried to be, good-natured, even if I’m not 100% sure of the criteria. I’d imagine it could be quite a nit-picking process of who makes it through the pearly gates and who doesn’t.” I suggest that when he’s judged, it’ll be by the old lady heckler from before, looking him up and down and shaking her head with tremendous sorrow. “Maybe!” he laughs. •This article was amended on 24 December 2023 to give the correct location for Halesowen College.

"The renowned artist and playwright John Byrne, whose parallel careers spanned the acclaimed BBC television series Tutti Frutti, the Slab Boys theatre trilogy and an album cover for the Beatles, has died at the age of 83. He died peacefully on Thursday with his wife, Jeanine, by his side, the Fine Art Society announced in a statement on Friday morning, describing Byrne as “one of the most inventive and versatile of all Scotland’s modern artists”. Byrne was born in Paisley and trained at the Glasgow School of Art. His early play, Slab Boys, debuted in 1978 and was inspired by his experiences working in the colour rooms of a carpet factory. It was later performed on Broadway in New York City, with Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn and Val Kilmer among the cast. His much-loved BBC series Tutti Frutti, about an ageing rock’n’roll band attempting a tour of Scotland, starred Robbie Coltrane and Emma Thompson and won six Baftas. Byrne was also a masterful painter, known for his self-portraits, as well as designing theatre sets and album covers, often for his friends, including Gerry Rafferty and Billy Connolly. His most recent mural work appears on the ceiling of the King’s Theatre in Edinburgh, with another in Glasgow to mark Connolly’s 75th birthday, while his paintings are displayed in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art and the Kelvingrove Art Gallery. Humza Yousaf said Byrne was “an extraordinary playwright, artist and designer”. The Scottish first minister said: “Scotland has lost a cultural icon, and the world is less brighter with his passing.” Nicola Sturgeon said on X that Byrne, who designed her first Christmas card during her time as first minister, was a “supremely talented playwright and artist, one of Scotland’s most important cultural voices of modern times, and the loveliest of men”. The Scottish contemporary artist Alison Watt posted: “So very sad to hear of the death of the brilliant John Byrne. Supremely gifted as an artist and playwright, generous, funny and the most stylish man I’ve ever met.” Byrne had four children, including the actor Honor Byrne-Swinton by the Oscar-winning actor Tilda Swinton."
"Authorities in New York have been accused by leading academics in France and Britain of repatriating fake Roman artefacts to Lebanon. Eight out of nine mosaic panels that the US authorities recently returned to the Middle Eastern country are not what they seem, according to claims made by Djamila Fellague of the University of Grenoble. She claims to have uncovered proof that forgers had copied designs from original mosaics in archaeological sites or museums in Sicily, Tunisia, Algeria and Turkey. “Eight of the nine ‘returned’ mosaic panels were fakes that [are] relatively easy to detect because the models used are famous mosaics,” says Fellague. She singled out a panel depicting an Anguiped Giant, that she believes is based on a section of the famous mosaics in the Villa Romana del Casale in Sicily, a Unesco world heritage site. She also claims to have discovered that a mosaic of Neptune and Amphitrite took as its main model a mosaic found in Constantine, Algeria, which has been in the Louvre in Paris since the mid-19th century. Of the other mosaics returned to Lebanon, she claims that there is only one example for which the forgers were inspired by an actual mosaic from Lebanon – a well-known depiction of Bacchus in the National Museum in Beirut. Christos Tsirogiannis, a guest lecturer at the University of Cambridge and a leading expert in looted antiquities and trafficking networks, believes the evidence is irrefutable. He said that were the revelation to be shown to be true it would be extremely embarrassing for the office of the Manhattan district attorney (DA), which had announced the repatriation of antiquities to Lebanon on 7 September. Its press release at the time stated that nine mosaics included in the repatriation ceremony were among dozens of Middle Eastern and north African antiquities that were allegedly brought into New York by a Lebanese antiquities trafficker. In 2022, the DA’s antiquities trafficking unit (ATU) had obtained a warrant for their arrest and applied for a red notice from Interpol. “Even if you are not an expert, if you put the fake next to the authentic mosaic, you see how similar they are, but also how the quality is actually not that good,” claims Tsirogiannis. He added that the alleged forgers had made the mistake of copying well-known mosaics, which have been extensively photographed by tourists with images widely available on the internet and in academic publications. “The whole thing is crazy. The authorities continually do these things without consulting experts.” Tsirogiannis leads research on illicit antiquities trafficking for the Unesco chair on threats to cultural heritage at the Ionian University in Corfu, Greece. Over 17 years, he has identified more than 1,700 looted objects, alerting police authorities and governments and helping to repatriate items. As soon as Fellague saw photographs of the mosaics in the press and online, following the September announcement, she says she sensed that most were “obvious fakes”. “At first I fought against this idea, telling myself that an investigation that led to a warrant arrest, a red notice from Interpol and a restitution to a country must have been the subject of a rigorous scientific study,” she said. She started to investigate further: “Very quickly, while searching, I found the models used by the forgers to make the forgeries.” She said: “In the press and official press releases – on both the American and Lebanese sides – there has never been any scientific justification to prove that the mosaics were Roman, looted and plundered precisely in Lebanon.” Before being seized by the US authorities in 2021, one of the mosaic panels was offered for sale in 2018 in a New York gallery, with an estimate of less than $20,000. Fellague suspects that a forgers’ mosaic workshop was located somewhere in the Middle East, probably in the 1970s and 1980s, judging from other pieces that have surfaced on the art market. A DA spokesman denied the accusations. “In order for these antiquities to be repatriated a court had to evaluate our evidence, which included expert analysis about their authenticity and significant details about how they were illegally trafficked. The court found based on the evidence – which these individuals do not have – that the pieces are authentic.”"
"Rosie Jones Comic and top doc maker Abba Voyage, London (2023) I went to Abba Voyage in March this year, for the second time, but this felt really special because I went with my mum, who is my favourite person and my biggest cheerleader. I grew up listening to Abba with her and it felt so lovely for it just to be me and her. It’s such an incredible experience: for the first five minutes you marvel at the technology but after that you absolutely forget that it’s not really them and you’re just transported. It felt like the perfect night with my mum who is my favourite person, though I don’t want to blow steam up her bum bum. I’ve had a very busy year this year – I’ve pretty much worked every day – but on days where I’m travelling hundreds of miles, or I’m doing a 14-hour shoot, I think back to Abba Voyage, and that night, and it brings me so much joy. I bought a dance booth which is the best place to see the whole show, and from start to finish she just danced and sang. At the end, we were hugging and crying. It was so great. * * * Carly Rae Jepsen Call Me Maybe pop megastar Pride and Prejudice (1995) This year I told my boyfriend to watch the 1995 series of Pride and Prejudice as an initiation process for really becoming my man, and he believed me. So I got to sit down with him and watch the entire series. He sat through Colin Firth in the wet shirt, the whole thing, and he had comments; he was invested. I don’t know why it summarises my year but it’s got so much comfort, and so much romance in it. All the homely things you want after a couple of years of chaos. I have seen that show more than 17 times and to watch it with someone that I love while getting cuddled beside the fire was so special. It feels so relaxing and stupid and just exactly what we need. I do reach for that with shows where nothing crazy is going on. It’s the perfect show for if you get sick for a week; you really need to take some time to commit but it’s perfect for magic escapism. * * * Nick Offerman Parks and Recreation star and hirsute hilarity generator Personnage by Joan Miró (1970) Both Personnage by Joan Miró and I were conceived in 1970, a bit surreal in proportion and shape and well equipped with a stout outer shell to withstand the peculiar hardships that life might bring to bear upon us, such as those I faced in 2023. My year was dominated by the ennui of inaction resulting from the writers’ and actors’ union strikes. Despite my wee flap-arms and extra-wide head, I was able to semi-regularly wield a picket sign on the frontlines at the studios in Hollywood and New York, proudly representing the labourers’ and makers’ side of the discussion. My extremities were also sufficient to propel myself about the territories of America, Ireland and the UK, observing with gratitude the regenerative farming that is taking hold more and more, reminding us that no laboratory, no “industrial” food system could ever hope to replicate the nutrient density and carbon captureability of rotationally grazed animals. My year may have been misshapen and bizarre, but as long as I am able to offer my bride a proper salute with my modest love-tab, then we will continue to seek out good workers with whom to thusly collaborate. * * * Devendra Banhart Freak folker Is It Cake, Too?, Netflix (2023) My defining cultural artefact of 2023 is the second season of Netflix’s Is it Cake?, AKA Is It Cake, Too?. I think of that show as an empathy-cultivating and compassion-training instructional video. On one level, [season one] was just a very simple, totally passive, totally easily digestible and forgettable bit of bubblegum pop culture. But the things that I suspected subconsciously became very apparent on the second season. I realised that it embodies our fundamental longing for community, ritual and healing. I started to watch it on mute while playing an album called The Pearl by Harold Budd and Brian Eno. Watching it in that context removed the competitive element that’s magnified by the show’s music. Suddenly I saw these very heartbroken people who felt so happy to find their community, and they were making mandalas, essentially; they were making sand paintings. These crazy cakes that are going to get destroyed at the end of every show. It’s an expression of attention and love and patience and an acceptance of impermanence in a pop culture context that I’d never seen before. And the prize? Diabetes. * * * Käärijä Finnish Eurovision 2023 runner-up Me, Myself &amp; Irene (2000) The year has been hectic and my career has skyrocketed thanks to the Eurovision song contest. It has demanded significant juggling between the everyday “Jere” and the “Käärijä” artist persona. Käärijä is a part of Jere, and vice versa, but these characters still have their differences and distinguishing their roles has caused both headaches and moments of joy! I liken my 2023 to Me, Myself &amp; Irene. In the film, two personalities live different lives within the same person and body. One of the personalities is crude, straightforward, daring and confident, speaking their mind openly. The other personality is an ordinary, polite, good citizen, even a bit shy. The bolder one seems to say and do things that the timid one might only dream of. I don’t have a personality disorder like the character in the film, but I see myself in the movie’s protagonist. For a year, I’ve had to balance my everyday self with the Käärijä persona. Daily life has changed to the extent that normal activities like going to the store are no longer possible. But of course, the moments of connecting with the fans are also really amazing – both for Jere and for Käärijä! * * * Loreen Sweden’s Eurovision 2023 entry – and winner F Major by Hania Rani (2020) A cultural moment that defined 2023 for me was the transcendent work of film director and artist Neels Castillon. He wrote and directed the stunning visual for Polish pianist and composer Hania Rani’s F Major, which was released in 2020. It inspired the look for my second Eurovision-winning single, Tattoo, and my latest release, Is It Love. He perfectly combined visually rich Icelandic landscapes with meditative moves that drew raw, human emotion. I took inspiration from his work to narrate my own compelling story that spoke to my north African Berber roots. It allowed the audience to witness a truly cinematic experience of what it means to be unapologetically Loreen. * * * Candice Carty-Williams Author and writer of BBC One musical drama Champion Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones) by Jai Paul (2013) It’s been a challenging year, for what feels like everyone, so it’s helped me to climb back into the past and engage mainly in culture from the last time I was remotely happy. This year for me can be summed up by Jai Paul’s first and only album, Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones), released/leaked in 2013, and the surprise live show he blessed us with at London’s Here at Outernet back in May. Hearing tracks from the album, already years ahead of itself when it was released a decade ago, live in 2023 had me weeping as I held myself up by the security barriers. A blast from the past that saved me in the present. * * * Rufus Wainwright Dapper balladeer Darkness by Lord Byron (1816) I’ve chosen something that wasn’t written this year, or last year. It’s a poem by Lord Byron called Darkness, from 1816. I’m putting the finishing touches to a requiem mass that I wrote that’s premiering in Paris next summer and interspersed into it will be this poem. I was writing this new classical piece and I thought: “I’m going to be really cutting-edge and try to do something really modern,” and I even thought of using transcripts from refugees, or text you find on TikTok. But then I was looking at some Byron poems and this jumped out at me. It was written in a year where a volcano erupted in south-east Asia that totally covered the world with cloud; there was no summer or spring. Everyone thought the world was ending because they didn’t know it was connected to the erupting volcano. It was also the year Frankenstein was written, so it was a particularly spooky year. It’s about ecological collapse and the world on fire, and cities being burned to the ground and people eating each other. By the end of the poem, Byron turns to the sky and refers to the universe as “she”, which I think is kind of fabulous, and basically all of this horror doesn’t mean anything to her. There’s no saving grace in it. It’s incredibly bleak. I don’t know if we live in the bleakest of times necessarily but with the environmental situation that’s unfolding quicker than we all thought, its imagery and its ideas and its fears are things all of us can relate to. * * * Cat Burns TikTok-winning singer-songwriter Heartstopper, Netflix (2022-23) The TV show Heartstopper is a positive lens showcasing the multifaceted queer experience of young people today. The show came at a time where I was exploring the different layers of my queer identity and the journey I’ve been on, and the storylines are relatable, so it has been such a comforting watch when I’ve been away on tour. Everything about Heartstopper, from its cast to the storylines, are diverse in so many ways, and it’s so important to have genuine representation on screen and in our culture generally, especially as a young, Black, queer woman myself. The show humanises and encourages LGBTQIA+ youth and our community authentically, really going into our complex stories which deserve to be told. I always keep this in mind with myself and the music I share with the world. * * * Mimi Webb Heartbreak balladeer Billie Eilish, Electric Ballroom, London (2023) Watching Billie Eilish perform a super-intimate show at the Electric Ballroom in London was a defining moment of 2023. Just seeing someone who I have watched fill arenas connect with fans in a way that made all of us feel like we were really experiencing something special together was so inspiring. Professionally, it’s been a year of firsts for me but one of my 2023 highlights was playing the main stage at Reading and Leeds. Seeing thousands of people in the crowd singing my songs back to me was a dream come true, and watching Billie showed me the importance of nurturing the relationship with your fans; that no matter how big you are as an artist, providing an intimate experience for them will only build a stronger and longer-lasting bond. As my year of touring wraps, I can’t help but think how to make the next tour bigger and better and Billie’s show gave me perspective on the beauty of going back to basics. * * * Ahir Shah Standup and Mash Report regular To Be Frank by Ali Lewis (2023) My wife and I got married on 28 October 2023. After the legal ceremony, we went outside for the saat phere, a Hindu ceremony wherein a couple walk seven times round a fire. Fortunately, the rain had been kept temporarily at bay by the Child of Prague, a statue of an infant Jesus left outside for good weather by my Irish wife. Before the saat phere, the poet Ali Lewis – one of my best men – read something he had written for the occasion, called To Be Frank. I should add, he’s an actual poet with books and stuff so it wasn’t shit. I spent a few Christmases in Nottingham with Ali’s family during my 20s. His father’s menorah would be lit, as would the tree. Ali read the most beautiful poem I have ever heard. A Hindu Londoner and an atheist Dubliner who left a Child of Prague out just in case then set off round a fire, into a life. I don’t know what culture is, but I know it when I see it. I know it when we make it. * * * Tiffany Calver Radio 1Xtra presenter Things Will Get Better by Cleo Sol (2023) With a music career that spans well over a decade, somehow only now does it feel like the world is discovering Cleo Sol. Similarly to her peer Little Simz, it’s such a rewarding feeling to watch the world welcome them. To watch their show capacities rise, the seats sell out faster than you can blink, and for them to finally get their dues. Given the highs and lows the world has been through over the past few years, it just hasn’t felt like any of us have had a real moment to catch our breath. In times like these, Cleo Sol’s musical offerings have felt like the warmest hugs. Her breakthrough album Rose in the Dark was released in 2020 during the start of a gruelling, heart-wrenching and anxious time for the world. A year later she gave us Mother and this year she gave us two albums – and on her latest, Gold, I found a connection to Things Will Get Better in particular. It has helped to bring my spirits up on some tougher days. If any of you are in need of some light and hopefulness, I truly recommend it. As we look back on 2023 and everything we have gone through, in whatever notion you choose to look at it, sometimes it’s nice to know. * * * Yaeji Hammer-wielding producer and musician Bungo Stray Dogs (2016-2023) I chose the anime series Bungo Stray Dogs. It follows a heist-like story featuring protagonists who work at a “detective agency”, and their main archenemies, the port mafia. Each season opens the scale of the world up exponentially, forcing us to quickly adapt to imminent issues. There is no clear villain in each arc and there are always multiple perspectives and truths coexisting; different forms of oppression and trauma that motivate each side of the parties involved – at times overwhelming, but also very real. This show is a reminder and reflection of the state of our world, the complexities of conflict, the oppressor and the oppressed, but also a reminder that we all have a heart, and we all come from various forms of pain. * * * Leona Lewis X Factor winner, actor and activist Untitled (Rise) by Sault (2020) The piece of culture that defines my 2023 is the album Untitled (Rise) by Sault, which came out in 2020. I just love this album so much. It’s all about spreading light, spreading love and I feel like we really need that in 2023, so it’s an album that I like to go back and listen to. Even though it was released a few years ago, I feel like it’s remained relevant, and is especially needed at the moment. Rosie Jones tours 3 February to 25 April; Rufus Wainwright’s musical Opening Night is at the Gielgud theatre, London, 6 March to 27 July; Ahir Shah is at Soho theatre, London, 22 to 27 January."
"My friend David Stafford, who has died aged 74 of lung cancer, sustained a varied career as a writer and broadcaster for more than 40 years. For a decade from the late 1980s, he contributed a much-loved weekly column to the Saturday Guardian, latterly known as Staffordshire Bull. His comedy writing career took off after he met Alexei Sayle in 1980, which resulted in several successful writing collaborations including the Time Out column Great Bus Journeys of the World, an award-winning Capital Radio series, Alexei Sayle and the Fish People (1981), and the Channel 4 film Itch (1991), directed by Beeban Kidron. Alongside this, David spent the 1980s establishing himself as a TV presenter, specialising in wry pieces on arts programmes such as Channel 4’s The Media Show. He later appeared regularly on BBC Two’s The Late Show (his teasing take on the 1989 film of Henry V endures on YouTube: “What churl would ever dare to pan a man as glam as Kenneth Branagh?”). As well as frequent radio work as a presenter and panellist on shows including Going Places, and guest presenter slots on Home Truths, from the late 90s David wrote a string of Radio 4 dramas with his third wife, Caroline (nee Moran), whom he married in 1993. The genuinely original, surrealism-tinged comedy series Man of Soup (1999-2000) was followed by shows including The Brothers (2004–07), Hazelbeach (2007-10) and the period legal drama Birkett (2012). David also collaborated with Caroline on seven witty, well-researched pop biographies, whose subjects ranged from Randy Newman and Ronnie Lane to Kenny Everett and Lionel Bart. Latterly David had found a niche as a crime novelist, creating the well-received Skelton’s Guide series of Golden Age-style 20s legal mysteries, the first of which, Skelton’s Guide to Domestic Poisons, was nominated for a Crime Writers’ Association award in 2020. David was born in Birmingham to Eveline (nee Hunt) and Ted Stafford, who ran a barber’s shop in Alum Rock. After attending King Edward VI grammar school in Aston, he studied drama at Birmingham University (1968-71), before working in street theatre as part of the newly established Interplay Theatre Collective in Leeds. David’s first two marriages, to Lin Hawkins and Alice Harper, both ended in divorce. He is survived by Caroline and their three daughters, Clemmie, Connie and Georgie."
"Barry Humphries holds a unique place in Australian entertainment history: a satirist, comedian and actor whose sardonic yet affectionate pillory of his home country saw him feted in the UK and the US. Seven months after his death, another side of Humphries is now on show in Adelaide, a city the Melbourne-born entertainer held special affection for. Twenty landscapes and portraits by the entertainer are on show for the first time at the Adelaide Festival Centre’s gallery, the private property of South Australian landscape artist David Dridan, one of Humphries’ longest and closest friends. The pair met in the early 1960s, after Dridan was awarded a British Council grant and a friend advised him to seek Humphries out in swinging London. Humphries was working as the understudy for the role of Fagin in a West End production of Oliver Twist, Dridan recalls, a role he would reprise on several occasions throughout his career. Poised to turn 91 next month, Dridan told Guardian Australia from his Adelaide aged care facility on Monday that he had yet to see the collection of 20 Humphries works he amassed over more than six decades displayed as an exhibition. He is expecting family to take him to the city to view the exhibition later this week. Dridan says the Humphries’ he knew and loved was the antithesis of his two most famous alter egos, Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson. “I think the public had the wrong impression about Barry, they assumed he was a bit of a larrikin,” says Dridan. “But he was very much a gentleman, terribly polite, he never swore. He always referred to me as his dearest closest friend.” Dridan returned to Australia to become curator at the Art Gallery of South Australia before establishing his own private gallery in North Adelaide in the late 1960s. Humphries remained in London, securing a number of character roles in West End productions and honing his solo satirical show skills in Peter Cook’s nightclub, The Establishment. Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett and Spike Milligan were in the circle he moved in. Whenever Humphries returned to Australia, however, he and Dridan would take to the bush for a week or so, to capture the beauty of the Murray River, the Clare Valley or the Flinders Ranges. Those who joined the party over the years included fellow artist Tim Storrier and Adelaide chef Pip Forrester. Dridan describes Humphries’ painting style as expressionist. His portraits drip with the same mocking humour as his stage work – he painted 17 portraits of Dridan over the years – but his landscapes are more reflective. Brisbane art dealer Philip Bacon, a long time friend and executor of Humphries’ trust, describes the landscapes as post impressionist. “There was never any angst in his paintings, they were always painted on holiday and they were always sunny and happy,” Bacon says. “He knew his portraits weren’t masterpieces; they were lighthearted, colourful and quick, just like his wit. But Barry was a great observer of people; he could capture a fleeting impression and get it down perfect.” The venue for the exhibition is significant. Humphries had a long association with the Adelaide Festival Centre and in particular Her Majesty’s Theatre, where the entertainer debuted as a 19-year-old participant in the Australian Universities Drama Festival. In 2015 Humphries was the artistic director of the Adelaide Cabaret Festival. Adelaide Festival Centre’s performing arts collection coordinator, Helen Trepa, says Humphries love of Adelaide stemmed from both his long performance history with the city and painting its surrounding landscapes with Dridan over many decades. “It’s like peeking behind the Hollywood curtain of his mind to see the personal side of Barry Humphries the artist.” By Barry Humphries: From the David Dridan Family Collection is on view at the Adelaide Festival Centre’s Festival Theatre Galleries until Saturday 13 April 2024."
"Posy Simmonds was born in Berkshire in 1945. She studied graphic design and illustration at the Central School of Art and Design in London and got her first newspaper gig in 1969 with a daily cartoon in the Sun. Her long association with the Guardian began in 1972. The paper serialised her middle-class satires Gemma Bovery in the late 1990s and Tamara Drewe in 2005-6; both became graphic novels and were later turned into feature films. Simmonds lives in London with her husband, the graphic designer Richard Hollis. Her exhibition Posy Simmonds: Dessiner la littérature is at the Pompidou Centre in Paris until 1 April 2024. 1. Book The Visionaries by Wolfram Eilenberger When I heard about this book I went straight out and got it. It’s about four female thinkers – Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, Ayn Rand and Simone Weil – and it follows their thinking and experience of war and authoritarianism through the 1930s and 40s, drawing from their letters and writing. Each has an extraordinary story. Weil and Arendt were triply marginalised because they were women, Jewish and intellectuals. There’s a bit written by Weil in 1937 which is incredibly prophetic about the political state of the world. It’s an extraordinary book and very readable. 2. Place Oare Marshes, Kent The Oare Marshes on the north Kent coast are the perfect antidote to London. I like going there even when it’s cold and dank. It’s very flat, with big skies and huge horizons, and it’s sort of where you feel England petering out. I’m a birdwatcher but I don’t take photographs. Usually we just amble about and sometimes make lists of what we’ve seen. The other day there were turnstones, redshanks, wigeons, little grebes, buzzards and cormorants, but no hen harriers. It’s lovely all times of year. 3. Dance Edward Scissorhands at Sadler’s Wells I’m looking forward to seeing this. I’ve heard it is wonderfully done and rather romantic. It’s a Matthew Bourne production, so it’ll be very lush. I haven’t seen the Tim Burton film it’s based on but I know it’s a tragicomic story about an outsider with scissors for hands. There’s love and bullying and it’s apparently quite funny at moments – Edward is eventually accepted because he does topiary and hairdressing. It should be a nice evening out, and Sadler’s Wells is handy because I can walk there. 4. Pub The Chequers Inn, Well, Hampshire I went here for research, because I wanted to see what went on in a country pub. It’s got huge chocolate-box appeal in that it’s got beams and brasses and prints and real ales. It was a cold night but the pub was very cosy and full of people having a nice time – and perhaps forgetting all the horror of the world outside. It was a warm, friendly place and the food was nice too, particularly the fish. The pub probably will remain anonymous [in my work], but I’ll incorporate some of its atmosphere. 5. TV Live at the Waterhole, WildEarth I discovered this by accident. It’s excellent slow TV showing video footage from waterholes in Africa – good if you’ve had a frazzled day. There are comments too – the audience can interact and ask questions – but I often turn the sound down. All you do is sit back and watch oryxes drinking or herds of elephants, whhich take absolutely ages to drink. Giraffes have to spread-eagle themselves to reach the water; they look like tripods. Sometimes there are lions and occasionally you get a hippopotamus. Sometimes absolutely bugger all is happening and you’re just looking at water. It’s just incredibly relaxing. 6. Shop L Cornelissen &amp; Son, Great Russell Street, London WC1 I’ve used this shop for a long time. It’s got a very handsome green facade and inside there’s a stupendous range of art materials. I go in with the intention of just buying three pencils but usually I leave with brushes and sepia ink and tubes of gouache, and they have very nice sketchbooks, so it’s hard to resist. They also sell specialist gums and resins, which I don’t use but other artists do. The people who run it are very nice and they know their stock terribly well."

"You could get it ridin’, you could get it slidin’. And it usually came on at about four. The words immortalised by John Meillon that became an affectionate and oft-parodied incantation for generations of beer drinkers is among the 10 iconic sounds of Australia preserved for posterity under the National Film and Sound Archive’s 2024 annual Sounds of Australia collection. There aren’t many Australians over 30 who wouldn’t instantly recognise Victoria Bitter’s campaign with the “big cold beer” tagline, which ran for more than two decades. But when it comes to nostalgia, the VB mantra faces stiff competition from another hard hitter of a bygone television era. The fact that the original theme music for Doctor Who, which also made it on to the archives’ 2024 list, was the creation of an Australian is probably less widely known. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Ron Grainer, who spent much of his working life in the UK, collaborated with the electronic music pioneer Delia Derbyshire and sound effects man Brian Hodgson to produce a sound style that was to define the science fiction genre of its time. The archives’ chief curator, Meagan Loader, says the VB ad, created by the George Patterson agency for Carlton &amp; United Breweries in 1967, is “almost etched in muscle memory” of Australians. “I feel like we’ve all grown up hearing this as you’re reaching for a beer in the afternoon, it’s so synonymous with that feeling and that moment, what having that end-of-the-day beer meant to so many.” Meillon returned on repeat occasions to record new versions of the ad over the years, each voiceover laid over Bob (Beetles) Young’s rousing score that felt like Australia’s answer to Bonanza. As society and culture matured, so did some of the ads’ portrayals of manliness – and some of the lyrics. Deleted from the original version: “You can get it swimmin’, arguing with women.” Even after Meillon’s death at the age of 55 from cirrhosis of the liver in 1989, his family gave permission for George Patterson to continue using his voice through digital remastering and recutting. The Doctor Who theme was just as instantly recognisable as it pulsated ominously from Australian small screens of the 1960s and 70s. While Grainer’s role is now acknowledged by Australia, its success also owed a lot to Derbyshire, who cut, spliced, sped up and slowed down segments of analog tape that had recorded white noise, a test-tone oscillator, and a single plucked string to create what is believed to be television’s first electronic theme music. “She called it ‘music concrete’,” Loader says. “And while it’s very common now – we produce it through machines – she did that all by hand at the time.” Another recording pioneer honoured in the list is the first Indigenous Australian to use recorded sound as a tool to preserve and document First Nations culture. Jimmie Barker, a Muruwari man who grew up on a reservation on the Culgoa River, began his electricity generating and sound recording experiments on a Milroy sheep station in the late 1960s. “He started experimenting with recording on abandoned water tanks and kerosene tins in mud using really similar principles to the recording techniques that were being developed at the time,” Loader says. “He saw a lot of change in his lifetime – the development of electricity and the internal combustion engine and telecommunications in the bush – but what he was really interested in was working out how to use this technology to capture the stories and culture of his community’s old people.” Funding from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) – later AIATSIS – enabled Barker to preserve more than than 100 hours of audio recordings between 1968 and 1972, detailing what he referred to as “the old ways” – preserving his elders’ stories from pre-colonial Muruwari and Ngemba culture. Another First Nations Australian recognised is Nova Peris, for her 2013 inaugural speech to the Australian parliament. The Olympic gold medal winner turned Labor senator – two firsts for Australian First Nations women – used her maiden speech to call for more effective strategies to close the gap between black and white Australians, a strategy already in its seventh year. The speech serves as a bookend to another speech made almost seven decades earlier by the Australian feminist campaigner Jessie Street, given during the first meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. Street, who was the only female Australian delegate, dared to demand that the word “sex” be inserted into the clause “without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion” wherever it occurred in the UN Charter. The veteran music artist Tina Arena, also known for her strident support of women’s equality in her field, is recognised with her 1994 hit Chains, from the multi-Aria award winning album Don’t Ask. Sound Unlimited’s 1992 hit Kickin’ to the Undersound is included as Australia’s first hip-hop song to reach the Top 20 in the local charts. On a final mournful note, the now permanently lost staccato sounds of the Christmas Island pipistrelle microbat were last heard and captured in a single ultrasonic audio recording in 2009. Shortly after the recording of the mammal’s echolocation (the use of sound waves to determine location) was taken from the only pipistrelle environmentalists could locate on the island that day, the species was declared extinct."
"With a new study showing that engaging with cultural activities is not only beneficial for your mental and physical health but can also save the NHS upwards of £8bn, getting out to more plays and galleries may be a good new year resolution for us all. So once you’ve shaken off the effects of New Year’s Eve, here are five shows with a variety of horror, drama, art and magic to see at the start of 2025. 1. RISE, City Park, Bradford In celebration of being named as the UK City of Culture for 2025, Bradford is rolling out a series of cultural and artistic projects and shows – beginning in January with RISE, an open-air magic show created by Kirsty Housley and Bradford-born Steven Frayne, the magician formerly known as Dynamo. Kicking off the city’s year-long showcase, RISE will take over Bradford’s City Park and has been described as exploring “heritage, people and magic found in unexpected places”. RISE will run on Friday 10 January and Saturday 11 January 2025 2. Inside No. 9 Stage/Fright, Wyndham’s Theatre, London Following on from their acclaimed horror anthology series, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith reunite to bring Inside No. 9 to the West End with Stage/Fright. The duo’s show, directed by Simon Evans, combines previous stories and characters from their combined bodies of work as well as original material, and will be their first stage collaboration since the live tours of The League of Gentlemen. Inside No. 9 Stage/Fright will run from Thursday 16 January to Saturday 5 April 2025 3. The Tempest/Much Ado About Nothing, Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London From the seasoned and prolific theatre director Jamie Lloyd come his adaptations of two of William Shakespeare’s most celebrated plays. Only days away from its first show, The Tempest, a story of hate and forgiveness, stars Sigourney Weaver as the wizard Prospero in her West End debut. His second Shakespeare project, Much Ado About Nothing, will feature Tom Hiddleston and Hayley Atwell as Benedick and Beatrice respectively, two opposites who are led to believe they are in love with one another. The Tempest will run from Monday 16 December 2024 – Saturday 1 February 2025 Much Ado About Nothing will run from Monday 10 February 2025 – Saturday 5 April 2025 4. The Face Magazine: Culture Shift, National Portrait Gallery, London From late February the National Portrait Gallery will be exhibiting photos from the pioneering cultural magazine The Face. The exhibition will be complemented by a special edition of the magazine, which will include interviews with famed contributors such as the photographer Glen Luchford, the designer Neville Brody and the art director Lee Swillingham. The Face Magazine: Culture Shift will run from Thursday 20 February – Sunday 18 May 2025 5. Franki Raffles: Photography, Activism, Campaign Works, Baltic, Gateshead Showing the work of the late Franki Raffles, this exhibition retroactively explores the lives of women and their roles in different societies around the world, including in the then Soviet Union, the Caribbean, Israel and Palestine– a theme prevalent throughout much of Raffles’s career. Franki Raffles: Photography, Activism, Campaign Works is running until Sunday 16 Mar 2025"
"It’s been more than three decades since Baz Luhrmann’s Strictly Ballroom was filmed in Petersham town hall. But earlier this year, the 82-year-old building in Sydney opened its doors to the Inner West Theatre Company’s production of the classic, free of charge. Beautiful brick early 20th-century town halls were once venues for council meetings, award nights and country dances. But in recent decades many have been under-used or left entirely empty as modern buildings serve changing community needs. Sydney’s Inner West council is the product of repeated amalgamations and, as a result, has an unusually large number of former town halls serving no obvious municipal purpose. Since July it has opened no fewer than seven as arts and culture venues with no hiring fees, hoping both to revive its old buildings and address a crisis in the performing arts sector. Since the Covid pandemic about 1,300 live performance venues around Australia have closed, leaving many in the music and arts industries struggling to stay afloat. In Sydney, revered institutions including jazz club 505 have been lost, and the number of people attending popular venues has almost halved. The cost of hiring a commercial venue for rehearsals and a final show can be as high as $80,000. In the first three months of the council offering its spaces free of charge, it has had more than 1,100 bookings across Marrickville, Petersham, Leichhardt, Annandale, St Peters, Balmain and Ashfield town halls, 72% of them for independent theatre, music or dance productions. Kane Wheatley is the musical director of the Inner West Theatre Company. “Being able to have the town hall at no cost means that our money can be spent in putting on great productions and … providing affordable theatre in a cost-of-living crisis for members of the community,” Wheatley says. His company has booked two musicals to run at the Petersham town hall in 2025. Tickets will cost $49, which just covers the costs of bringing in sound and lighting equipment. “It’s such a large town hall with that beautiful, big foyer, which means that we can operate our front of house … we have a theatre liquor licence so we can run a little bar,” Wheatley says. The council’s mayor, Darcy Byrne, says offering affordable spaces for rehearsal, exhibition and live performance mirrors one of the original functions of town halls. “Most town halls in Australia traditionally were used for dances, concerts, major events and so, in a way, by repurposing them as arts and cultural venues, we’re going back to their traditions,” Byrne says. Most town halls in Australia were built in the late 19th and early 20th century. Lisa Murray, formerly the historian for City of Sydney council, says when they opened they were “cutting edge” – many of the Victorian buildings boast Italianate-style exteriors, a clock tower and ornate halls. But after the second world war, Murray says, councils began building civic centres to expand their services and in the 1950s there was an “explosion” of municipal libraries. Town halls were no longer the sole site for council business. Like many of their counterparts around the country, the inner west buildings have retained Victorian or early 20th-century heritage features (other than Ashfield, where art deco did not survive the 1970s). They offer large performance spaces with elaborate stages and commercial kitchens, and have been fitted out with live performance and recording equipment. “In a lot of them, the acoustics are challenging because they were designed in the era when people were giving speeches without microphones,” Byrne says. “There’s acoustic treatments that may be necessary but absolutely, in every town across Australia, there is one of these beautiful buildings that’s currently being greatly under-utilised.” In Victoria, the state government is also investing in the restoration of town halls to make them fit for modern community purposes, including through the Tiny Towns Fund for regional areas. North of Melbourne (which is home to 30-odd town halls), Clunes is the third largest locality in Hepburn shire council. It has recently restored its town hall, built in 1873, after cracks began to appear in the masonry and the symmetrical facade started to rotate. The project manager at the council, Sam Hattam, says revitalisation of the building gets the community engaged to start using the space. Thirty minutes away, the council’s headquarters at Daylesford town hall are also due to undergo restoration and electrical works later this year. Creswick town hall, renovated in 2021, is used for the newly established folk n’ roots music festival CresFest. Byrne hopes the momentum from such efforts will make other council areas think about throwing open their doors as Inner West has done. “The councils across Australia are spending millions and millions of dollars every year on the maintenance and repair of town halls because they have enormous heritage and civic value,” Byrne says. “But the truth is most of them are sitting empty, dormant and unused for 80% or 90% of the time, which is just a waste of a great public resource.” • This article was amended on 25 November 2024 to correct the year Clunes town hall was built."
"Late-night hosts discussed Joe Biden’s meeting with Donald Trump and Trump’s announcement of Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Seth Meyers Barely a week after the election, Joe Biden met with President-elect Donald Trump in the White House, where both men appeared confused before reporters. “I believe the one thing these two old-ass dudes can agree on is that they can’t understand a word you’re saying,” laughed Seth Meyers on Wednesday’s Late Night. “The press is treating this like the Beatles landing at JFK but to them, it sounds like a plane taking off at JFK.” Trump “attempted to be normal, but still made it a little weird”, said Meyers. The president-elect, seated next to Biden, told the press: “Politics is tough and it is in many cases not a nice world but it is a nice world today and I appreciate it very much.” “It is unnerving watching Trump try to behave,” said Meyers. “It’s like watching the neighborhood bulldog who’s always terrorizing mailmen mope around with a surgery cone.” For his part, Biden promised Trump that his administration would “do everything we can” to accommodate the transition of power. “Or don’t!” Meyers suggested. “I mean, you correctly called him a criminal fascist and threat to democracy. I’m not saying booby-trap the place, but you don’t have to be overly helpful. I mean, how are you going to accommodate him, anyway? Update all the toilets so they can handle more classified documents? Restock the fridge in Stephen Miller’s office with mice?” Meanwhile, Trump has announced a “Pandora’s cabinet of goblins and weirdos” and is going to “stick them on the government like a bunch of ferrets on ketamine”, Meyers lamented. This includes the Fox News host Pete Hegseth, a former army national guard member who is Trump’s pick for secretary of defense. To summarize Hegseth’s qualifications, Meyers played a 2015 video of Hegseth throwing an axe outside Fox studios, clearing the target and accidentally hitting a civilian. “Why are you throwing an axe near people in midtown Manhattan?!” Meyers exclaimed. “Saying yes to that takes the same kind of unearned confidence it takes to say yes to being secretary of defense with zero government experience.” Stephen Colbert Eight days since the election, “I’ve been saying, quite sincerely, hey, let’s not get out over our skis here,” said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show. “Let’s take this one day at a time. Maybe, maybe, betting against all logic and previous experience, it will be different this time. “I was right. Because it’s already way worse,” he continued, especially as Trump announced on Truth Social that he was nominating Matt Gaetz to be attorney general of the United States. “During the campaign, I thought if Trump won, he would do the worst things I could imagine,” said Colbert. “Turns out, I don’t have much of an imagination. There is not enough Botox in the world to hide how shocked I am. There is also not enough Botox in the world because Matt Gaetz used all of it. “What a horrifying idea this is,” he added. “Matt Gaetz, nominated for the top law enforcement office in the United States, is currently under investigation by a House ethics panel that issued a subpoena for him in a sex and drugs probe. When you hear that, it really makes you wonder: did he bring enough drugs to share? Because I could really use them right about now.” Trump also named Tulsi Gabbard director of national intelligence. Colbert, who interviewed Gabbard during her 2020 presidential run, said: “When I think Tulsi Gabbard, the word ‘intelligence’ is not the first one that comes to mind. Or the second.” Gabbard has spread Russian propaganda on fringe far-right sites, to the point that Hillary Clinton said Russia was “grooming” her. “But only because she’s too old to be groomed by Matt Gaetz,” Colbert quipped. Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump’s meeting with Biden. “It was so weird seeing Trump back in the White House,” he said. “It’s like if there was a sequel to Snakes on a Plane, but this time the plane was all snakes.” Biden and Trump met for about two hours, with each promising reporters a “smooth” transition. “Just me, or did that sound like two guys talking about their bowel movements there?” Kimmel wondered. “When you see Donald Trump sitting in front of a portrait of George Washington, you realize how ridiculous this whole thing is,” he added. Kimmel also touched on some of Trump’s administration picks, including Gabbard for director of national intelligence, “which is a big job”, he said. “It could interfere with her other job, working for Russian national intelligence.” And he had special ire for Gaetz, who remains under investigation for the alleged sex trafficking of a minor. “You know, at a lot of jobs, being investigated for sex-trafficking underage girls would hurt your chance for advancement,” he said. “But in the Trump administration, you can list it on your résumé under ‘special skills’. “What a team he’s putting together,” he concluded. “It’s the legion of dumb.”"

"In 2016, I worked with Forensic Architecture and Amnesty International to lead the acoustic part of the investigation into Sednaya, the Assad regime’s most notorious prison. Since the uprising against the regime began in 2011 until the early hours of Sunday, the prison had been inaccessible to journalists and independent observers. The memories of the few people who have been released were the only resources available to learn about and then document the mass-murder, torture and violation that took place there. In Sednaya, prisoners’ capacity to see anything was highly restricted. From the time detainees were taken from their homes or pulled out of protests and thrown into cells, they were blindfolded. In the cells they were kept in darkness, made to cover their eyes and face the wall in the presence of the guards. Over time, they developed an acute sensitivity to sound. My task, as an artist and audio investigator, was to develop “earwitness” interviews with six survivors of Sednaya, using their sonic memories to help reveal the crimes that took place inside. As well as darkness, silence was brutally enforced. To speak, cough or audibly move was to risk death. Even when the prisoners were being beaten they could not make a sound and thousands of those who could not stop themselves from crying out were killed. With the survivors I interviewed, I set about using tones, white noise and re-enacted whispers to measure the silence and the lethal pressure it exerted. One description of that silence has stayed with me ever since. Jamal, a witness I interviewed told me: “One of the loudest sounds, aside from the horrendous torture noise, was the killing of lice”, the amplitude of which, he said, was equivalent to “crushing a sesame seed between your thumb and forefinger.” If you have a sesame seed in your kitchen, I implore you to take it now, crush it and imagine just what kind of violent force it would take to maintain that level of quiet in a building containing thousands of people. The only thing to puncture the silence was the beatings that would vibrate the walls and reverberate throughout the empty water pipes in the cells. “It doesn’t sound as if someone is hitting a body”, Jamal explained, “but like someone is demolishing a wall.” “The whole structure vibrates,” Salam told me, as he described the way the regime weaponised the omnidirectional bleed of sound so that a beating for one was experienced by all. And then silence. Back in 2016, whispers, echoes and sesame seeds were all we had to tell the story of this death camp. In the few days since it has been liberated, we have already seen documentation of what those survivors described to me; in one video a man remains in the submissive squat position prisoners were forced to occupy in the presence of the guards and he does not reply to his liberators when they ask his name. Now that Sednaya is liberated, the work of more tangible investigative practices, such as forensic anthropology, will commence in order to understand the scale of this crime against humanity. Our investigation taught us that the architecture of the prison was inextricable from the violence that happened inside. In the minds of survivors, the experience of the building could not be isolated from hunger, torture, the constant threat of death and sensory deprivation. And yet already completely different images of Sednaya are landing on our social media feeds. We see people moving through it unhindered, with lights on, talking loudly, with open eyes, while the endless sounds of torture are replaced by the incredulous cries of prisoners at the moment of their liberation. As horrendous as their experience was, many of the survivors we interviewed didn’t want Sednaya to be torn down. They foresaw a free Syria, in which this weapon in the guise of a building should be preserved and the memories it contains safeguarded. Samer, another witness, remembered the joyous sound of bread slapping on the floor outside the cell doors, a noise that meant that he would have just enough food to live another day. He wanted to hear this sound again and said that if he could, he would record it, make it his ringtone and play it at his wedding. This response to a sound that encapsulated so much of the horror he lived through taught me just how precious the memory of violence and oppression can be. Sednaya must now be used to serve the thousands of lives which were imprinted by it. There is an opportunity to use it to heal by making it a site of the preservation of memory of the thousands of people who survived this death camp and for those who did not. To witness in Sednaya was an act of survival. Hearing and identifying where the guards were at all times could help you live. Listening out for the sonic details was vital, be it the resonant metallic “tong” of the guards descending the metal central spiral staircase, or decoding which cell door they opened by the particular sound of that specific lock, or by hearing how many new prisoners were being brought into the prison and committing to memory any names overheard of people being taken for execution. All these details helped them to survive, but also helped us to tell the story of Sednaya for future generations. In this way, these survivors-cum-earwitnesses taught me how to listen and use sound in defence of human rights. Their acute sensitivity to sound taught me how this medium can be a weapon of torture and collective punishment – but also how effective listening can be as an act of resistance."
"My wife, Helen Mahoney, who has died aged 45 from breast cancer, was a project manager and consultant. She spent her career working with arts charities across the north of England, with a particular focus on improving access to music and cultural events. Helen was a strong believer in social justice and that everyone should be able to enjoy the arts and creative activities. As well as working with organisations such as Opera North, Drake Music and Live Music Now, Helen also had concern for the people involved in running these projects. In 2022 she completed a master’s in social research at York University, graduating with a distinction. Her dissertation looked at the impact on the arts professionals delivering such things, and how they might be better supported. While she loved North Yorkshire, she was acutely aware of the issue of rural isolation. Her work had moved towards improving opportunities to help cultural industries thrive in the countryside. In recent years Helen and I had established our own company – Ryedale Creative – and at the time of her death were working on a range of feasibility studies focusing on creative rural centres. Helen loved dance and performance, and was constantly dreaming up projects, including running Coquette, a successful burlesque and cabaret night in York, for a number of years. She also performed in burlesque events across the country, and had an affinity for ballet and Bollywood dancing. Born in Bridgend, south Wales, to Liz (nee Williams), a nursery nurse, and Barry Mahoney, a pilot, Helen went to Porthcawl comprehensive school. She then pursued her love of the written word, studying English at Cardiff University, where she and I met in 1998, becoming a couple in 2002. After graduating with a first in 2001, Helen studied for a postgraduate diploma in arts management at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama the following year. In 2005 we moved to Yorkshire, where we made our home in the countryside around Ryedale and the Howardian Hills. Helen and I married in 2009. She was a phenomenal mother, a friend to many, a loving daughter and sister, and the best partner anyone could wish for. Helen is survived by me, our son, Noah, her parents and her sister, Carol."
"I first became aware of Camila Batmanghelidjh through the disrupting influence of Kids Company. It was on the frontline of childcare in London, and everybody will remember the strong, vivacious, articulate woman at its head. There was something about her – how she dressed and the words she spoke – that showed me she wasn’t your average founder of a children’s charity. And then there were the stories that radiated out from her. She had a meeting with the queen, and during that meeting she got a call from a child in a panic, and she took the call, left the meeting and went to that child. Most heads of children’s charities would not have that kind of contact. It made her a threat to the status quo of the sector and I liked that. We met in 2009 while I was artist-in-residence at the Southbank Centre, and the artistic director Jude Kelly wanted us to meet inspirational people who saw creativity as the heart of their practice. Down the road was Camila at the Kids Company HQ. I remember sitting in her creative office; I got such a warm feeling of welcome and ease from her. She was Iranian and she was British. She was highly educated but wore it lightly, and she was as at ease speaking to a prime minister as to a child who didn’t know how to talk to her. She wore clip-on earrings because when she worked with children who needed care and help, she was aware they might grab her ear, and that they wouldn’t know how to behave when in disturbed states. She profoundly understood the intricacies of trauma and how it manifests itself in children’s behaviour. Having grown up in care myself, this is why I loved her. We stayed in contact after that. Ours was a physically distant but emotionally close relationship. I met her at her home in West Hampstead, and probably one other time, but we exchanged a lot of emails, and at Christmas she would send me presents (colourful cups, saucers and bowls; a Christmas jumper; a winter coat). She once wrote me an email that said: “Do you know how much I love you?” in the subject line, and the answer in the first line of her email was: “To Persia and back, one million times.” She got through my walls. She would say to me, “I see you. I see you.” So when I was less likely to visit her home – for years I didn’t feel up to visiting people in their homes – she wouldn’t disappear. She would stay in touch regardless. Our relationship strengthened in the middle of the furore around Kids Company. It was closed down in 2015 on the back of false accusations of financial mismanagement and sexual impropriety within the organisation, which were investigated by the police and they found no evidence of wrongdoing. The official receiver’s case against the charity dragged on for years but was ultimately thrown out by a high court after a 10-week hearing in 2021. She was vindicated, but the shunning continued. I was in touch with her throughout, mainly via email, and made public announcements in support of her. She was constantly aware of having to make it clear that she had the legal proof against what was being said, but nobody would listen. I didn’t believe the accusations against her. A journalist claimed that she’d used Kids Company money to get a big house with a swimming pool, which was nonsense. She lived in a small two-bedroom apartment. There were dark forces working against her, and Camila was full to bursting with light. She was the embodiment of integrity in children’s social care. I think a lot of people were jealous of her, because when she was being castigated by the powers that be, people standing up for her publicly were noticeable by their absence. I don’t think there’s a better example of a person in the charity sector being so wrongly accused. The judge not only exonerated her and all of the trustees, but also commended them for their brilliant work and their dedication to children. It’s really important to know that, throughout it all and right up until her death, she remained working for and with young, traumatised children and families that needed her help – she didn’t stop. That’s how awesome she is. They didn’t kill her spirit. There are some extraordinary people in this world, and Camila Batmanghelidjh was one of them."
"After retelling the story of the Blitz from a new angle, Steve McQueen’s next project is an alternative photographic history of protest and campaigning in Britain, spanning a century from the suffragettes to the Iraq war protests. Resistance will open at Margate’s Turner Contemporary in February 2025, which the gallery’s director said would show how “photography has really acted as a kind of catalyst for change” in the UK. Clarrie Wallis, who first worked with McQueen on Year 3 at Tate Britain, said Resistance is a continuation of the artist and director’s concentration on telling untold stories. “It’s a portrait of Britain,” she said. “It’s understanding the shape of Britain, how we are, where we are. Steve has a commitment of bringing marginalised histories into the mainstream.” The exhibition, which is also planning to tour around the UK, starts in 1903 with images of the suffragettes that were published by a supportive picture editor at the Daily Mirror and finishes in 2003 with the Iraq war protests – the largest ever seen in the UK, as 1.5 million people took to the streets of the capital. Curated by McQueen and produced after a four-year research process, Resistance also includes images from the Battle of Cable Street when fascists clashed with Jewish and anti-fascist protesters in London’s East End in 1936 and the Battle of Lewisham, when the National Front were confronted in the multicultural area of south London in 1977. “It is also about us understanding our shared past,” said Wallis. “It’s interesting when you look at the Battle of Cable Street, and then you look at the Battle of Lewisham, you know, and then recent events. There is that sense of really wanting to shine a light on these stories that people aren’t aware of.” McQueen and researchers have trawled agency archives and personal collections to foster new perspectives on the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; the Friends of the Earth’s first protest against the banning of bottle returns by Schweppes; the Kinder Scout trespasses of 1932 that led to the founding of the national parks; and the Hull trawler wives who campaigned for more safety at sea after several fatalities. There will also be photographs that were taken on the Black People’s Day of Action in 1981, a mass demonstration that weaved its way through London and was organised after a house fire at 439 New Cross Road that claimed the lives of 13 black children. McQueen has previously produced a documentary about the tragedy, which followed his five-film Small Axe series in 2020. Many of Britain’s best-known photographers appear in the exhibition, including Vanley Burke, Henry Grant, Fay Godwin, Edith Tudor-Hart, Tish Murtha, Humphrey Spender, Andrew Testa and Paul Trevor. Works by Christine Spengler and Janine Wiedel will also feature. An accompanying book will be published by 4th Estate and will feature writing from Paul Gilroy, Leila Hassan Howe, Gary Younge and Sally Alexander. McQueen’s latest film, Blitz, displayed a more diverse side to London during the German bombing raids, with a Nigerian air raid warden, and Ken “Snakehips” Johnson, a gay jazz singer who performed at London’s Café de Paris, both appearing. The lead character, George, was inspired by a picture McQueen saw of a young black boy being evacuated from London in the 1940s. “I came across this photograph of this small black child, this boy with a large overcoat and a very large suitcase. I thought to myself, that’s my ‘in’. Who was he, what was his story, we need to see the war through his eyes. What was it like for him?” Wallis said: “In some ways this was a massive history research project, not dissimilar to the work that he was doing around Blitz: excavating and finding stories that, for different reasons, haven’t properly come to light.” The Oscar-winning film director recently revealed that he paused the filming of Blitz in order to be treated for prostate cancer. McQueen, whose father died of the disease in 2006, spoke for the first time about his own treatment, which led to a tumour being removed in November 2022. Resistance is on at the Turner Contemporary in Margate from 22 February to 1 June 2025"
"CES, the leading consumer-electronics trade show, is facing criticism after picking Ivanka Trump to serve as its keynote speaker next month in Las Vegas, after years of being accused of overlooking the role of women in technology. The selection of Donald Trump’s daughter and top adviser exposes the vast electronics expo to charges that when, finally, it invites a female keynote speaker, it invites one with limited experience in technology. “This is a terrible choice on so many levels but also – what an insult to the YEARS AND YEARS of protesting how few women were invited to keynote &amp; being told it was a pipeline problem while similarly-situated men were elevated,” tech commentator Rachel Sklar tweeted. “There are so many great, qualified women. Shame.” CES, formally known as the Consumer Electronics Show, confirmed this week that Trump will join a keynote discussion on jobs and the future of work alongside Gary Shapiro, the president of CTA, the firm that produces the event considered the largest of its kind globally. “I am excited to join this year for a substantive discussion on the how the government is working with private-sector leaders to ensure American students and workers are equipped to thrive in the modern, digital economy,” Trump said in a statement. While the president’s daughter has been involved in White House efforts to boost the economic empowerment of women and their families, and spoke at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in The Hague this year, her engagement with technology is limited. Shapiro said in a statement: “We welcome her to the CES keynote stage, as she shares her vision for technology’s role in creating and enabling the workforce of the future.” But set alongside Quibi chief Meg Whitman and founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, NBCUniversal’s Linda Yaccarino, Daimler’s Ola Källenius, Delta’s Ed Bastian, Samsung’s Hyun-Suk Kim and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff – all speakers at the tradeshow – Ivanka Trump’s own business credentials appear slight. “If they can have a female 007, they can have equally badass female keynote speakers in the tech sector,” said Cindy Chin, the chief executive of the consultancy CLC Advisors and founder of Women on the Block, which promotes the empowerment and inclusion of women in technology. “There needs to be more systematic representation of speakers across the board and not just for keynotes,” Chin said. “It would be better if the background of the keynote speaker actually fit the industry it is serving and inspirational rather than talking heads and political.” Given her relative lack of experience, the selection of Ivanka Trump for CES highlights an enduring gender bias in the tech, electronics, and mobile industries – a bias that endures despite women controlling $29tn of spending worldwide, Chin said. “Women purchase over 50% of traditional male products, including automobiles, home improvement products, and consumer electronics. Of all consumer electronics, over 61% of sales are initiated by women including the rise of mobile, AI and machine learning products,” said Chin, a member of Nasa’s Women in Data open innovation program."
"Twitter’s rules for political advertising will include new restrictions on micro-targeting, a move that will increase pressure on Facebook, the company announced on Friday. The policy rollout follows Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s surprise announcement on 30 October that the company would ban all political advertising due to a belief that “political message reach should be earned, not bought”. The new rules will go into effect on 22 November. “Advertising that uses micro-targeting presents new challenges that are not yet fully understood,” said Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s head of legal, policy and trust and safety, on a conference call with reporters on Friday. “It’s a big change for us as a company, but one we believe is going to make our service and hopefully political outcomes around the world better.” Micro-targeting on Facebook is significantly more advanced – and more lucrative – than it is on Twitter. Facebook’s vast trove of data about its billions of users has allowed it to offer advertisers an incredibly powerful machine for targeting precise segments of a population with messages tailored to their personal characteristics. Facebook has faced significant criticism over its political ads policies in recent months, and the idea of placing restrictions on micro-targeting has gained popularity, including with Ellen Weintraub, the chair of the Federal Election Commission. Such rules could have significant implications for Facebook’s business. Twitter’s vice-president of trust and safety, Del Harvey, said on Friday that the company did not expect material changes to its fourth-quarter revenues based on the new restrictions. Under Twitter’s new policy, candidates for political office, political parties and elected or appointed government officials will be entirely barred from running ads of any kind. In the United States, political action committees, Super Pacs and advocacy not-for-profits known as 501(c)(4)s will also be banned from any advertising. All users will be banned from running ads that reference candidates, parties, officials, elections, referendums, ballot measures, legislation, regulation or judicial outcomes. The sole exception to this rule will be news publishers, provided they meet Twitter’s standards for certification as a news outlet. News outlets will be allowed to promote reporting about political issues, but will not be allowed to advertise explicit advocacy journalism, such as an editorial board endorsement of a political candidate. The new policy does carve out an exception for ads by non-political figures or organizations to advocate for political or social causes. This appears designed to allay concerns raised by the US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and others that the new rules would silence climate change activists while giving free rein to fossil fuel companies. These “cause-based” ads can address political issues such as the environment, economy or “social equity” as long as they do not directly advocate for or against legislative, electoral, regulatory or judicial outcomes. These issue ads will be subject to Twitter’s new restrictions on micro-targeting, however, and can only be aimed at broad geographies or non-political keywords or interests. Advertisers will not be able to target their ads toward other, more personal characteristics, such as race, gender or political affiliation. “Cause-based advertising has value and can help drive public conversation around important topics, but we still don’t think it should be used with the goal of driving political legislative outcomes,” said Harvey. Twitter will allow for-profit organizations to run cause-based ads if they are related to an organization’s values or principles, as long as the ad does not have the “primary goal” of influencing political, judicial, legislative or regulatory outcomes. The company is not introducing an explicit ban on false statements in these issue-based ads – an area that has sparked considerable debate after Facebook decided to allow politicians to promote false information in ads. “One of the benefits of Twitter being a public platform is that you can be held accountable for what you say,” said Harvey. “Part of what we’re trying to do with the limits on targeting is to prevent those super-siloed arguments.”"
"An American teenager who is using makeup tutorials on TikTok to spread awareness of China’s detention of at least a million Muslims in internment camps in Xinjiang has claimed her videos are being censored by the platform.

She instructs: “Then you’re going to put [the eyelash curler] down and use your phone … to search up what’s happening in China, how they’re getting concentration camps, throwing innocent Muslims in there, separating families from each other, kidnapping them, murdering them, raping them, forcing them to eat pork, forcing them to drink, forcing them to convert.” “This is another Holocaust, yet no one is talking about it. Please be aware, please spread awareness in Xinjiang right now,” she says, before turning back to the eyelash curling lesson. The post has more than 1.4m views on TikTok and has been widely shared on Twitter as well, where one post was viewed more than 5m times. The teenager, who has said she is an Afghan-American from New Jersey, claims her account, @getmefamouspartthree has been censored in the past by TikTok. Her profile description reads: “Just a Muslim who wants clout. Got deleted last time”. In one video she explains: “By the way I say this so TikTok doesn’t take down my videos.” She posted the same videos to Twitter and Instagram. TikTok has denied censoring her posts. “TikTok does not moderate content due to political sensitivities,” a spokesman told the BBC. He said the company had banned one of Aziz’s videos because it broke rules on terrorism-related material. Aziz has hit back that TikTok misunderstood her videos and immediately suspended her account after she posted content related to Xinjiang. In addition to videos about Xinjiang, she had made comical videos making fun of derogatory comments that she has received, including one related to Osama bin Laden. “As a young Muslim growing up in a white community and in a country where your own people see you as outsiders, I grew accustomed with the racism,” she said. “I had to learn that I should not let these comments get to me and that I can make a positive impact – so that’s why I created my TikTok account. I created funny videos regarding the discriminatory comments I face every day. “Then I made a new account and it was suspended right after I spoke about the Uighurs again. I did not get any message from TikTok on why my video spreading awareness was taken down and later on my account was deleted. I highly doubt TikTok’s response.. I find this really suspicious.” TikTok, which is owned by the Beijing-based technology company Bytedance, has come under fire for censoring content deemed unacceptable by the government. In leaked moderation guidelines seen by the Guardian, the company did not mention Xinjiang directly but banned “highly controversial topics, such as separatism, religion sects conflicts, conflicts between ethnic groups, for instance exaggerating the Islamic sects conflicts”. International criticism and scrutiny of Beijing’s policies in Xinjiang have grown following unprecedented leaks of classified government documents that undermine Beijing’s claims that it does not run so-called re-education camps but voluntary vocational training centres. The documents directly connect Chinese leader Xi Jinping to the crackdown and detail guidelines in how to “prevent escape” of detainees who must stay in the camps for a minimum of a year. Close surveillance of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang has prevented many from communicating with the outside world, behaviour that lead to them being sent to a camp. Still, activists and Uighurs within China have used Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, to communicate with people overseas and most recently to raise awareness by posting videos of people crying or beating their chest. Those overseas are also working to draw attention to the cause. Aziz said she was “astonished” after seeing her video go viral. “I’m so happy that I got to help spread awareness on an issue that needs to be brought to light,” she said. In another video, she said: “Generations before us didn’t have the same power as we do now and that’s technology. We can reach millions across the world. We can reach those who have power to do something about it. Our voices can do so much.”"
"After the success of the Greggs vegan sausage roll and the juicy-yet-meatless Impossible Burger, the next new food sensation is coming to a plate near you: 3D-printed steaks and chicken thighs. Printed meat could be on European restaurant menus from next year as Israeli and Spanish firms serve up realistic beef and chicken produced from plant protein. And, within a few years, the printers are likely to be available to buy so that consumers can produce their own at home. Layers of material are built up by 3D printers until there is a solid object conforming to very precise specifications. The meat can be produced either from vegetable matter or from animal cells grown in a lab. The printer uses these raw ingredients, which come in a Nespresso-style cartridge, to build up a steak or chicken fillet that tastes like the real thing. Eshchar Ben-Shitrit, co-founder and CEO of Israeli firm Redefine Meat, said switching to printed meat would have huge ecological benefits. “The biggest reason for going to alternative meat is because of the future of our planet,” he said. “We love meat but we don’t have enough resources for it. Cows require a lot of water, a lot of food and a lot of land but we don’t have enough of any of these. We can recycle, drive electric cars, we can shower less, but these changes can’t compete with reducing consumption by one hamburger per week.” Reducing beef production would result in a huge reduction in CO2 emissions and far less clearance of wild countryside for grazing land. Other meats, such as pork and fish, will soon be added to the menu, reducing the need for pig-rearing or fishing. The health benefits are substantial too, said Ben-Shitrit. “If you eat meat, there are nutritional advantages and disadvantages. But definitely people consume too much. Plant-based products don’t contain cholesterol or the pathogens that exist in meat.” They would therefore be attractive to many vegetarians who could gain the nutritional value without a moral dilemma. Poorer nations, where traditional meat is too expensive for most of the population, will also benefit in time. Redefine Meat will pilot its plant-based meat in restaurants throughout Europe early in 2020, so British diners could have next year’s Christmas lunches printed for them. It has already served hundreds of people in Israel and conducted tastings in Europe. The products will initially be more expensive than traditional meat – the firm is aiming for a price point around £28 per kg, twice the cost of British supermarket sirloin steak – but this will come down over time and should, eventually, be cheaper than traditional meat. “It’s really good, tasty meat that we produce here,” said Ben-Shitrit. “The question is how to scale up so you can put it in a butcher’s shop in London day in, day out. So our business model is to sell the machines and the ingredients, not the finished meat.” Worldwide, meat production is booming. According to UN figures, in the early 1960s, around 70 million tonnes of meat was produced. By 2017, that had multiplied to more than 330 million tonnes. Britons eat about 80kg of meat each per year. The technology for 3D-printed meat is improving rapidly. Last month, another Israeli firm, Aleph Farms, printed meat produced from cow muscle cells on the International Space Station. The company says its meat will be on general sale a few years from now. Before then, Spanish-based Novameat expects to have its plant-based printers in Spanish and Italian restaurants by the end of 2020, and in British restaurants soon after. Its CEO, Giuseppe Scionti, plans to have the machines in supermarkets in 2021 and in homes a year or two later. Pea and rice proteins are fed into Novameat’s printers in capsules like those for an espresso machine. They contain a red paste that is turned into realistic steak or chicken. Salmon, lamb and pork capsules will be coming soon. Scionti believes the quality of what comes out – steaks and chicken fillets that mimic the taste and fibrous texture of meat – will be the key to its success. The British market is a major target. “In Britain, the ‘flexitarian’ [largely vegetarian, but sometimes eating meat] movement is very big – around one third of the population,” he explained. “This way you can support biodiversity and avoid food waste because so much shop food is discarded.” The technology is being closely watched by the food industry. Emma Lake, news editor of the Caterer, said: “The potential market for 3D-printed meat could be substantial; we’ve already seen dramatic growth in vegan meat imitations in response to more consumers cutting down on their consumption of animal products for environmental and health reasons. The launch of the Greggs vegan sausage roll in January demonstrated the interest in such products.”"
"Sir Tim Berners-Lee has launched a global action plan to save the web from political manipulation, fake news, privacy violations and other malign forces that threaten to plunge the world into a “digital dystopia”. The Contract for the Web requires endorsing governments, companies and individuals to make concrete commitments to protect the web from abuse and ensure it benefits humanity. “I think people’s fear of bad things happening on the internet is becoming, justifiably, greater and greater,” Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, told the Guardian. “If we leave the web as it is, there’s a very large number of things that will go wrong. We could end up with a digital dystopia if we don’t turn things around. It’s not that we need a 10-year plan for the web, we need to turn the web around now.” The contract, which has been worked on by 80 organisations for more than a year, outlines nine central principles to safeguard the web – three each for governments, companies and individuals. The document, published by Berners-Lee’s Web Foundation, has the backing of more than 150 organisations, from Microsoft, Twitter, Google and Facebook to the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation. At the time of writing, Amazon had not endorsed the principles. Those who back the contract must show they are implementing the principles and working on solutions to the tougher problems, or face being removed from the list of endorsers. If the stipulation is properly enforced, some may not last long. A report from Amnesty International accuses Google and Facebook of “enabling human rights harm at a population scale”. The report comes weeks after Google was found to have acquired the personal health records of 50 million Americans without their consent. The contract’s principles require governments to do all they can to ensure that everyone who wants to can connect to the web and have their privacy respected. People should have access to whatever personal data is held on them and have the right to object or withdraw from having that data processed. Further principles oblige companies to make internet access affordable and calls on them to develop web services for people with disabilities and those who speak minority languages. To build trust online, companies are compelled to simplify privacy settings by providing control panels where people can access their data and manage their privacy options in one place. Another principle requires companies to diversify their workforces, consult broad communities before and after they release new products, and assess the risk of their technology spreading misinformation or harming people’s behaviour or personal wellbeing. Three more principles call on individuals to create rich and relevant content to make the web a valuable place, build strong online communities where everyone feels safe and welcome, and finally, to fight for the web, so it remains open to everyone, everywhere. “The forces taking the web in the wrong direction have always been very strong,” Berners-Lee said. “Whether you’re a company or a government, controlling the web is a way to make huge profits, or a way of ensuring you remain in power. The people are arguably the most important part of this, because it’s only the people who will be motivated to hold the other two to account.” Emily Sharpe, the director of policy at the Web Foundation, said: “The web’s power to be a force for good is under threat and people are crying out for change. We are determined to shape that debate using the framework that the Contract sets out. “Ultimately, we need a global movement for the web like we now have for the environment, so that governments and companies are far more responsive to citizens than they are today. The contract lays the foundations for that movement.” • This article was amended on 25 November 2019 to include Twitter among the signatories."
"Google is preparing to launch a personal checking account service, a move that comes as its big tech rivals are increasingly focused on consumer finance. The project, in partnership with Citigroup and code-named Cache, is expected to launch next year. The existence of project, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as some of the world’s biggest tech companies are challenging the primacy of the banking industry. Over the past year, Facebook has announced it is working on a digital currency, Apple has introduced a credit card and Amazon has been in talks with banks to introduce personal accounts for consumers. Each, in turn, is likely to stoke fears of consumers and regulators alike that technology companies are gathering too much information on their consumers. News of the project comes a day after a whistleblower revealed the existence of Project Nightingale – Google’s partnership with the healthcare giant Ascendant that could give Google access to personal medical data of up to 50 million Americans. On Tuesday, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged Europe to seize control of its data from Silicon Valley tech giants and establish “digital sovereignty” instead of relying on Amazon, Microsoft and Google. “So many companies have just outsourced all their data to US companies,” Merkel said. “I’m not saying that’s bad in and of itself – I just mean that the value-added products that come out of that, with the help of artificial intelligence, will create dependencies that I’m not sure are a good thing.” While Google has enormous reach – 1.4 billion people regularly use Gmail – so far each of the tech giants’ financial offerings have run into problems. Several partners have pulled out of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency after regulators signaled opposition, while Apple’s credit card partner, Goldman Sachs, has been sued for allegedly offering discriminatory credit limits. According to the Journal, Google is not planning to self-brand its checking or personal account service. “Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,” Google executive Caesar Sengupta said. “It may be the slightly longer path, but it’s more sustainable.” Sengupta said Google would not sell checking account users’ financial data in the same way that Google does not share data from its fast-growing service Google Pay with advertisers. “If we can help more people do more stuff in a digital way online, it’s good for the internet and good for us,” Sengupta told the newspaper. But how far Google will have to go to reassure a wary public that it can be trusted with what is arguably their most intimate information – money and health – is open to question. The consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company found only 58% of people surveyed said they would trust the company with financial products. A 2017 study by Bain &amp; Company found that 45% of those surveyed in the UK said that existing banks offered all the services they need online. David Donovan, a technology-banking specialist at Publicis Sapient, said technology companies are partnering with banks to deal with the regulatory issues. “They could prove to be a Trojan horse over time,” Donovan said. “But the banks are also thinking this is an easy way to get customer acquisition so it could be a win-win for both sides.” Consumers increasingly expect the same type of experience from banks as they get from Apple or Google and big tech is undoubtably going to be in financial services in some way, independently or by partnership, Donovan believes. “There’s an emerging demographic accustomed to a certain experience underpinned by emergent technology and banks are saddled with a lot of legacy technology. So they’re going to have to upgrade to be more digitally native and responsive, or they’re going to be disintermediated, or left out, by technology companies,” he said."
"More than a dozen pro-democracy activists, journalists and academics have spoken out after WhatsApp privately warned them they had allegedly been the victims of cyber-attacks designed to secretly infiltrate their mobile phones. The individuals received alerts saying they were among more than 100 human rights campaigners whose phones were believed to have been hacked using malware sold by NSO Group, an Israeli cyberweapons company. WhatsApp launched an unprecedented lawsuit against the surveillance company earlier this week, claiming it had discovered more than 1,400 of its users were targeted by NSO technology in a two-week period in May. Filed in a Californian court, the lawsuit described the alleged attacks as an “unmistakeable pattern of abuse” that violated US law. Two pro-democracy campaigners from Morocco who received the WhatsApp warnings said any use of the sophisticated malware, known as Pegasus, against them would be a serious violation of their rights. “I am a big proponent of democratisation in the Middle East in general and in Morocco in particular,” said Aboubakr Jamaï, a campaigner and former journalist who lives in France. “The Moroccan regime is certainly less nefarious than, say, the Syrian regime, but it’s nonetheless an authoritarian regime who can use some despicable means against its opponents, as it did.” Jamaï, who has gained international recognition for his groundbreaking work as a publisher who faced jail for his journalism, said he was contemplating his own separate legal action against NSO, and would consider a possible class-action suit with other alleged victims. Abdellatif El Hamamouchi, a 22-year-old human rights activist in Rabat who has been campaigning for justice for the jailed newspaper editor Taoufik Bouachrine, also received the alert. Hamamouchi said: “I already strongly believed that I was under surveillance from the Moroccan authorities, but it surprised me that these attacks were coming from abroad, and they involved an Israeli company. The action taken by WhatsApp against NSO is a positive thing. “I have not heard from NSO since I was informed about this, but I would regard any explanation they could give as worthless.” At least six Rwandan dissidents have also come forward with claims they were targeted by Pegasus, according to interviews with the Financial Times. Among them was Faustin Rukundo, a British citizen who is a member of a Rwandan opposition group and lives in exile and in fear of Rwanda’s security services. In India, 17 people, including human rights activists, scholars and journalists, are said to have confirmed to Scroll.in that they were targeted by spyware on WhatsApp. NSO has said it will contest “in the strongest possible terms” the WhatsApp lawsuit, but declined to comment further. It has insisted it cannot comment on its customers, or the people who have received alerts from WhatsApp. The company said it investigated all serious allegations against it and had recently adopted a new human rights policy. “The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years,” the company said. “We consider any other use of our products than to prevent serious crime and terrorism a misuse, which is contractually prohibited. We take action if we detect any misuse.” However, NSO has faced a chorus of criticism because of the alleged abuse of its technology. It is widely reported to have sold its spyware to authoritarian regimes including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The WhatsApp lawsuit also claims human rights activists and lawyers were not the only intended victims of the cyber-attacks, with unnamed diplomats and senior government officials also targeted. Although WhatsApp declined to provide more details about the claims, Reuters reported on Thursday that the targeted officials were from “multiple” US-allied countries. Pressure on NSO grew on Friday when the Israeli security cabinet minister, Ze’ev Elkin, insisted the government had nothing to do with the company. In an interview on Tel Aviv radio, he described NSO “as a private player” and said if anyone had done anything wrong, “then the justice system here and in other countries will throw the book at them”. The Indian government has called on WhatsApp to submit a detailed report by next week on claims that many Indians were targeted. Some NSO employees complained on social media after Facebook – which owns WhatsApp – appeared to have shut down accounts of employees at the cyberweapons company. One referred to Facebook as “the world’s greatest privacy violator”. “Facebook, you never cease to amaze me,” wrote one executive in a publicly available post on LinkedIn, which was liked by several other NSO employees. “Yesterday, both of my personal Facebook and Instagram profiles were intentionally disabled by the world’s greatest privacy violator in the history of mankind, aka Facebook.” NSO declined to comment on the remarks. Facebook also declined to comment, but pointed to the WhatsApp lawsuit, which urged the court to order “a permanent injunction enjoining and restraining (NSO) and their agents, servants, employees from accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp’s and Facebook’s service, platform and computer systems.”"
"Fibre-to-the-node broadband connections do not deliver advertised speeds as often as other NBN technologies, data from the Australian competition watchdog has revealed. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s latest broadband measurement report, released on Thursday, showed people who are connected to the national broadband network via fibre-to-the-node – which uses more existing copper wiring than any other technology – experienced a nine-point lower percentage of advertised speed compared with people on fibre-to-the-curb, fibre-to-the-premises and the cable network connections. The report showed the average download speed for fibre-to-the-node users was 80.8% of the speed they had paid for, and 79.7% in the busiest times. This compares with 90.7% on fibre-to-the-curb, 90.1% on cable, and 89.7% on fibre-to-the-premises. This total included 11% of users who were identified as having underperforming services that had speed tests under 75% of the maximum download speed and therefore required to have their service remediated. When underperforming services were excluded, most other technologies remained at the same percentage, while fibre-to-the-node jumped up 8 percentage points. Fibre-to-the-node is fibre cable right up to a box, usually on the end of a street, that then uses the existing Telstra copper phone lines for the remaining distance to people’s homes. It means the speed received depends on the quality of the copper line and the distance from the node to a person’s home. The report, which gathered data from 1,125 volunteer NBN users in August, found Optus performed best out of retailers, with an average download speed of 88.5% of the advertised plan, and 87.6% during busy hours. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Vocus-owned telcos Dodo and iPrimus performed worst at 79.4% overall, and 76.4% in busy hours. The report continues to show ongoing performance issues with fibre-to-the-node, which is now the most common way people connect to the national broadband network. NBN has sought to play down issues with the technology, last month going as far as to suggesting its own methodology for speed test comparisons with the rest of the world based on the download speed people pay for, rather than they actually achieve on the NBN. While Optus performs well on the NBN, the company is also moving ahead with its plans to move into 5G for home broadband that will directly compete with the NBN. The company this week expanded its $70 per month unlimited data 5G plans out to 138,000 homes. The company’s cheapest NBN plan for 50 megabits per second download speeds is $70, but the 5G plan is currently boasting much higher speeds, up to 400 megabits per second in off-peak periods."
"Facebook has come under fire this week after a hoax story about women being abducted in white vans went viral on its platform. The site’s algorithms are thought to have perpetuated the circulation of the story. The story resulted in a TV appearance on Monday by Baltimore’s mayor, Jack Young, who warned citizens that the white vans are abducting women for sex trafficking and selling their body parts, even though the claims have not been substantiated. “It’s all over Facebook,” he told a local news station. The platform says it is is now trying to stop the misinformation from spreading even further – by limiting the circulation of viral posts that are perpetuating it. This week, the Guardian uncovered a far-right network pushing out thousands of fake news articles about the US congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. When the Guardian notified Facebook of its investigation, the company removed several pages and accounts – but not because they were spreading misinformation. The media platform removed only content that “appeared to be financially motivated”. Here are some other unsubstantiated stories that remain on the platform. 1 Trump’s grandfather, the pimp, and his father, the KKK member A story from the American Herald Tribune claiming that Donald Trump’s grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader continues to circulate on Facebook. It also claims that the president’s father, Fred Trump, was a KKK member. The article was thought to be shared almost 30m times, despite having no substantial evidence to support its claims. Fred Trump was detained during a KKK protest in Queens, New York, in 1927, but he was released without charges. Trump’s grandfather, Frederick Trump, owned hotels and restaurants in Seattle. The Trump family biographer Gwenda Blair said that one such restaurant in the middle of Seattle’s red-light district, the Dairy, advertised “rooms for ladies” – commonly thought to be a euphemism for prostitution. However, there is no evidence that he was a pimp – something Blair herself stated. 2 Ilhan Omar attended an al-Qaida training camp Another false story that had an estimated 77,000 views claims that Omar attended an al-Qaida training camp. It comes from a photo taken at a Mogadishu training camp by the Associated Press in 1978, three years before Omar was born. Facebook flagged the post as fake as part of its goal of reducing fake news on the site, but it continues to circulate elsewhere online. In October, the North Dakota state senator Oley Larsen shared the debunked post on Facebook. 3 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to ban motorcycles A story claiming that the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to ban motorcycles in the US was shared online more than 12m times on Facebook, and has since been debunked. It comes from the website Taters Gonna Tate and quotes Ocasio-Cortez as saying: “Besides like, what I just said? A lot of these like, motorcycle people, OK, they’re like: ‘Ooh, look at me, I’m all old and fat and tough and I voted for Trump and smell like wet dog.’” Although the website is clearly satirical, articles written on it have been taken seriously – including one that claims Ocasio-Cortez believes that soldiers are paid too much. A Louisiana police officer shared that article in a Facebook post in July, calling Ocasio-Cortez a vile idiot and saying she should be shot. 4 Holocaust denial content Facebook has repeatedly made the case that it is not the job of the platform to remove Holocaust denial content. Mark Zuckerberg memorably defended the rights of Facebook users who post Holocaust denial content in 2018, saying that he didn’t “think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong”. He later added that he found Holocaust denial “deeply offensive”, but maintained that the platform’s role is not to remove things that people get wrong."
"A former Facebook moderator is suing the company, alleging that his work scouring the site of violent and obscene content caused his post-traumatic stress disorder. Chris Gray, who now works as a tour guide, is seeking damages from both Facebook Ireland and CPL, the contracting firm that directly employed him. The case, filed on Wednesday in the Irish high court in Dublin, is thought to be the first time a former moderator has taken the social network to court. According to court documents, Gray’s work required him to review “approximately a thousand tickets per night”, initially focused on pornography, and later “on content that had been reported as being threatening, hateful, bullying, or otherwise dangerous”. Two years on, a number of specific pieces of content remain “particularly marked” in his memory, the legal writ says, including “a video in which a woman wearing an abaya is seen being stoned to death”, “a video in which persons, who appear to be migrants in Libya, are tortured with molten metal”, and “video footage of dogs being cooked alive”. Aggravating the trauma, Gray’s lawyers argue, was the fact that the nature of the work required him to “obsess” over particular videos. Facebook and CPL “valued accuracy … above all else”, and tracked whether individual calls were made correctly or not. But the system did not allow moderators “to hold or skip a ticket pending a decision from above”, requiring them instead to focus deeply on particular pieces of content, often featuring violent or upsetting material. The complaint details one video, for instance, “which collaged various scenes of people dying in different accidents … set to a musical soundtrack. [Gray] had a long argument with the quality point of contact [a senior role] about whether the music meant that the person posting it was ‘celebrating’ or whether it just counted as disturbing content.” Speaking to the Guardian before the case was filed, Gray said: “You would wake up and you’re remembering the video of someone machine-gunning people in the Middle East somewhere, trying to think whether there was an Isis flag, and so whether it should be marked as terrorism-related or not. “It took me a year after I left to realise how much I’d been affected by the job. I don’t sleep well, I get in stupid arguments, have trouble focusing.” Gray is being supported in his case by Foxglove, an international NGO that backs efforts to hold big tech to account through the legal system. Cori Crider, Foxglove’s director, said: “The reason we’ve got involved is that we think that social media factory floors are unsafe and need to be cleared up. In a decade we’re going to look back on this as we did at meat packing plants at the turn of the century. “Facebook’s only going to pay attention to things when they know that they’ve got a typhoon bearing down on them. What I’d like to see is the moderators realising how much power they have if they just organise. Because let’s face it, social media as we know it could not exist without the labour people like Chris provide.” In October, leaked audio from a Facebook all-staff meeting revealed Mark Zuckerberg describing reports about poor working conditions in the company’s moderation centres as “a little overdramatic”. “From digging into them and understanding what’s going on, it’s not that most people are just looking at just terrible things all day long,” Zuckerberg told employees. “But there are really bad things that people have to deal with, and making sure that people get the right counselling and space and ability to take breaks and get the mental-health support that they need is a really important thing. It’s something we’ve worked on for years and are always trying to probe and understand how we can do a better job to support that.” A Facebook spokesperson said: “We are committed to providing support for those that review content for Facebook as we recognise that reviewing certain types of content can sometimes be difficult. Everyone who reviews content for Facebook goes through an in-depth, multi-week training program on our Community Standards and has access to extensive psychological support to ensure their wellbeing. This includes 24/7 on-site support with trained practitioners, an on-call service, and access to private healthcare from the first day of employment. We are also employing technical solutions to limit their exposure to graphic material as much as possible. This is an important issue, and we are committed to getting this right.” CPL have been contacted for comment."
"The Nationals MP Anne Webster is lobbying senior ministers to bring forward legislation that would force Facebook and other platforms to assume editorial responsibility for the content they publish, in an effort to combat proliferating misinformation. Webster launched defamation proceedings against Australian conspiracy theorist Karen Brewer over a series of posts made on Facebook in April this year. The posts, which were shared hundreds of times, including on accounts associated with Mildura, Webster’s home town, accused the first-term MP of being “a member of a secretive paedophile network” who had been “parachuted into parliament to protect a past generation of paedophiles”. Brewer also claimed without evidence that a charity founded by Webster and her husband to help single mothers in Mildura access education was “a cover for the supply of young teenage mothers to a secretive paedophilia network”. Brewer was ultimately ordered to pay $875,000 in damages after a federal court judge labelled the claims “disgraceful and inexplicable”. Webster outlines her draining ordeal in an interview on Guardian Australia’s politics podcast this weekend. The MP also reveals she is pressing the government to take remedial action. “I am pushing that we do have legislation that calls Facebook and whatever platforms to account as publishers,” Brewer says in the interview. “I’m not saying that holding these platforms to account as publishers is the only answer, but it is the clearest answer that I can think of”. “If anyone has a better answer, then fine, let’s do that, but at the moment I see these platforms really get away with far too much and are not being held to account – so I think that’s got to stop”. Facebook last month apologised to Webster over months-long delays in responding to reports of abuse she received from the online conspiracy theorist. Webster says that remedial action was too long in coming. The Nationals MP is contemplating pursuing a private member’s bill if she can’t persuade the government to take on the platforms and require them to take editorial responsibility for defamatory content and bullying. “I’m not going to be sitting down waiting for somebody else to do something because this is incredibly important and it affects many, many lives”. Webster says senior government ministers are resisting the idea that platforms be deemed publishers with the same editorial responsibilities that mainstream media publishers have. The platforms have also fiercely resisted that categorisation. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics podcast last year, the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said Facebook’s argument that it was not a traditional publisher was “an appropriate point for them to make, because they don’t hold themselves out [as that]”. “I don’t think we can dismiss reality – a digital platform is a different kind of business to a traditional media organisation that has editorial obligations.” Webster says the current resistance to meaningful change “involves several ministers” but that she does not intend to be deterred. “I think we need to pursue it”. She says the problem was the regulatory environment was lagging the take-up of technology. Webster likens the societal impact of the technological disruption to washing up in a “strange land”. “It’s as though – when we are talking about social media platforms and in fact digital information technology generally – that we, 20 years ago, landed on this unknown environment and we have to learn to breathe, we have to learn to perhaps walk differently – like the moon, there may be different gravitational pulls,” she says. “There are just different effects that happen, whether it’s speed – whether it’s the ability of thousands of people to comment instantaneously”. “We have a new environment, and I think that politically we have a responsibility to make sure policy addresses that different environment, and I don’t think we’ve done it well”. The MP says since details of her ordeal with Brewer have come to light she has been overwhelmed by expressions of support from the community and from fellow parliamentarians, some of whom had have endured similar experiences. She says it might be possible to build cross-party support for legislative change because misinformation online goes beyond vicious attacks on people in public life – people in the community are also battling terrible experiences of bullying and misinformation of social platforms."
"A chancellor who will borrow £394bn this financial year has to come up with a few new ways to raise money, and here’s a Treasury idea that sounds modest but interesting: put VAT on Uber taxi trips and stays in Airbnb properties. It would also seem to pass a basic test of fairness. Most Uber drivers and Airbnb providers are too small to be registered for VAT, but, taken as a whole, their sectors genuinely compete with companies that do pay VAT. Every night in a seaside Airbnb is one less visit to the local hotel, so there is also a question of keeping the competitive playing field level. The change would feel slightly rougher on Uber drivers, whose earnings will have been clobbered by lockdowns and the evaporation of the night-time economy. But the Treasury, presumably, has the post-vaccination recovery period in mind and an Uber trip seems an odd service to fall largely outside the VAT net. It’s hardly an essential of life like food and children’s clothes. Converting a £5 fare into a £6 fare probably wouldn’t disturb demand. Rishi Sunak will be sensitive to the charge of being a digital luddite – he likes to give the opposite impression – but he also has to face the fact that “the sharing economy” is now large enough to nibble at the tax base. VAT reforms with Uber and Airbnb would be relatively painless. Far bigger and tricky decisions on taxation lie ahead. Setting the records straight on Hut Group’s paper millionaires It’s hard to open a newspaper these days without encountering Matthew Moulding, the photogenic executive chairman of The Hut Group. There he was in the Daily Mirror this week, talking about how he has spread wealth among the online retailer’s workers: “We have created more millionaires than any other company in British corporate history.” The precise number is 74, he says, out of 430 employees who were incentivised with shares during the Hut’s time as a private company, ahead of its £4.5bn stock market flotation in September. That is definitely impressive – and Moulding’s 25% stake, including a recent £830m bonus, means he’s done splendidly himself. But a British record? It depends how you count it. A total of 399 employees of Barclays were paid £1m or more in 2019, according to the annual report. Bankers’ bonuses are not quite like freebie shares, of course, but it all counts from the employee’s point of view. Indeed, an intriguing question is whether the Hut’s paper-rich toilers will cash a few chips when the lock-up period on share sales expires next March. At the moment, 338 employees own equity worth a total of £556m, says the company. Maybe the shares, up a third since float, are going to the moon, as half the City analysts seem to think. But it would require quite a commitment for regular employees to leave life-changing sums sitting in a single stock that, to put it mildly, enjoys a high-profile and a racy rating. Stagecoach profits bucks the trend in lockdown London Your eyes did not deceive you, London buses really were mostly empty during lockdown. Reassurance may be needed after a glance at the financial performance of Stagecoach’s London bus division in the May to October period: revenues up 5% to £126m and operating profits 80% better at £9.2m. The explanation is that Stagecoach, like other bus operators in the capital, is paid to run a service while the revenue risks sit with Transport for London. There were adjustments to contracts to reflect reduced mileage during the pandemic, and thus save TfL a few quid, but Stagecoach clearly wasn’t left out of pocket. The increase in revenues arose because the company operates more contracts than it did a year ago, but an operating profit margin of 7.3% was still very healthy. It was a different tale outside London. Profits collapsed there because the “fare box risk” sits with the operator. But, as with train operators (not Stagecoach’s game these days), bailout salvation was available in the form of grants to keep regional bus services running at break-even. In the circumstances of a stay-at-home pandemic, almost any profit figure better than zero counts as a triumph for a transport company. Stagecoach, after paying £15.7m in interest costs, just about managed it. Martin Griffiths, the chief executive, remembered to thank every government in the land. One should hope so too."
"It didn’t come as a huge surprise when Oracle Corp announced it was moving its headquarters from California to Texas last week. The world’s second largest software company, founded in Silicon Valley in the late 1970s, had already transitioned parts of its 135,000-member workforce to Austin over the last two years as executives sought to cut costs. But, following other high-profile departures, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s move from San Jose, California, to Houston, and the Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s very public exit, and amid a steady stream of news reports on San Francisco residents leaving the Bay Area, Texas officials started seeing an opportunity to gloat. “While some states are driving away businesses with high taxes and heavy-handed regulations, we continue to see a tidal wave of companies like Oracle moving to Texas thanks to our friendly business climate, low taxes and the best workforce in the nation,” said the Texas governor, Greg Abbott. Although it’s true that with the rise in remote work easing geographical workplace restrictions companies created in California could be looking for less-costly labor and lower taxes, industry experts say the San Francisco Bay Area remains the innovative center of the US tech industry and that title isn’t slipping away any time soon. Austin, which has long held its position as one of the top-10 tech destinations in the US, isn’t necessarily a competitor for California, they argue, but a colony. “There is little sense that there is any massive relocation of startup ecosystems out of San Francisco,” said Richard Florida, a professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto and the co-founder of CityLab. “I think most people are just waving their hands”. Yet there are challenges on the horizon, experts and policymakers admit. While Silicon Valley’s spill-over into other states won’t immediately shift the tides, the region’s ability to retain business moguls and churn out new startups will be crucial to its future. The biggest competitors in that area aren’t coming from inside the US. ‘Still the most innovative economy in the world’ Tech companies have established outposts in the Lone Star State to cut costs, helping cities like Austin steadily grow its tech sector over the last two decades. Austin’s tech hub is even dubbed the “Silicon Hills” a nod to where most tech companies got their start. But even some of the most easily recognizable names sprouting offices in those “hills” still officially call the Bay Area home: Facebook, Apple, Google and even Musk’s Tesla aren’t likely to shift the bulk of their businesses out of California any time soon. “There is a satellite system that’s developing,” Florida said, “but the hub of technology and innovation in the United States is the San Francisco Bay Area.” The Bay Area still boasts more startups than any other state, eclipsing even its closest rivals in venture capital and investment. The nine-county region boasts a $535bn GDP and ranks 19th among the world’s economies. This year, it regained its title as the top large metro in the “best-performing cities’ ranking of the Milken Institute, an economic thinktank, praised for its “abundant venture capital, and innovation and entrepreneurial culture support regional high value-added industries, including the expanding tech and biotech industries”. It’s also continued to foster a good environment for new fast-growing companies – nearly a quarter of the companies on this year’s fastest-growing companies list compiled by Fortune were launched in California. Startup data from 2018 shows that more than $81.8bn was invested over a two-year period in San Francisco. Austin saw roughly $3.6bn for the same time period. “This is still the most innovative economy in the world,” said Dee Dee Myers, the director of the California governor Gavin Newsom’s Office of Business and Economic Development. “I am not saying we don’t have challenges we don’t need to try to solve – but people have been saying that California is over for a long time and it keeps not being true.” Acknowledging that CEOs have left in search of lower taxes, more space, or cheaper labor, she argued that the Golden State was where some of those businesses grew to begin with. “They have benefited greatly from being here,” she said. Challenges ahead That doesn’t mean there’s not cause for concern. Although California still attracts close to half of all venture dollars, its share is declining. Texas may not be a threat to its tech sector, but competition is creeping in from outside the country. “The United States has really been dramatically losing share of high technology businesses,” Florida said. “San Francisco is still one of the biggest centers but Shanghai and Beijing are very close behind.” This year’s annual Bloomberg Innovation Index – an analysis that looks at a variety of metrics, including the number of hi-tech companies, manufacturing potential and research and development spending – listed the US as ninth in the world, after giving it the top spot in 2013. San Francisco and San Jose were ranked No 1 and 2 in investment per capita, according to a 2018 analysis by the Center for American Entrepreneurship, a research and advocacy organization. But the same report awards Beijing the top spot for driving global growth. “America’s once-singular dominance is now being challenged by the rapid ascent of potent startup cities in Europe, China, India and elsewhere,” the report said, adding that the US is losing its ability to attain high-skilled individuals who are instead increasingly staying in their home countries. The US is also failing to keep pace on funding research and development, and falling behind in education – two areas essential to a robust homegrown startup sector. If the innovation economy in the US – and particularly in San Francisco – would start to slow, that could pose serious challenges for the state of California, sharpening the sting when big businesses like Oracle relocate their operation to cheaper locales. California’s budget and ability to fund key state initiatives disproportionately relies on its ability to retain its richest residents. In the last budget cycle, close to 70% of California’s coffers came from personal income revenue, and the state has the highest marginal income tax rate in the nation. Texas, meanwhile, is one of seven states with no personal income tax. “I am pretty worried about the exodus from California,” said Mark Duggan, the director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (Siepr). “We are much more dependent than other states on those in the top 1% or even 0.1% of the income distribution.” It’s not just businesses that have been on the move – residents have been pouring out of California this year. As California faces a difficult financial recovery from the Covid crisis, deepening its already devastating racial and financial disparities, officials will have to balance an equitable economic recovery along with fostering a competitive business environment. Calling the issue a “perfect storm of factors” Duggan said new remote working possibilities, the rising cost of living in the state and a sharp spike in the state’s already high income tax that was created by Donald Trump’s 2017 tax plan could drive more business leaders away. These issues could make it harder for California to continue in its role as a tech center. “It is all the more important for someone to articulate a vision,” he added. “I don’t see a strategic vision being outlined for the state – and I think that’s going to cost us.” Myers, Newsom’s economic adviser, agreed that the state is facing big challenges, especially when it comes to balancing an equitable economic recovery along with fostering a competitive business environment. “You have to do both things at the same time,” she said. “We have always had a really progressive tax structure and there are built in challenges with that.” But, she is confident in California’s financial future. “These are hard issues to address,” she said. “But we will have to address them.”"
"A hotline for reporting suspected child abuse material online had a record month in September, with calls increasing 45%, driven by the shift to working from home and more time spent online, an internet watchdog has said. The UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which identifies child sexual abuse content online, said it processed 15,258 reports from the public in September 2020, a record for the charity and up from 10,514 in September 2019. Analysts at the IWF’s hotline assess the reports so criminal material can be quickly removed from the internet. In 2020, up to September the IWF processed a total of 230,520 reports, including tip-offs from members of the public, the police, and internet providers. In the whole of 2019, itself a record year, IWF analysts processed 260,400 reports. The IWF’s hotline director, Chris Hughes, said: “More people spending longer at home, and more people being more active online may mean more people are spotting criminal content and calling it out.” However, Hughes said some of the analysts’ time was being taken up dealing with reports of material that was not in the IWF’s remit, such as potentially provocative slogans on children’s clothing or reports of legal adult pornography. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the IWF, said the coronavirus pandemic has made this a particularly busy year for the IWF. She said: “Our trained analysts view and assess some of the worst material on the internet, and this year we have had to adapt so they can keep coming to work safely. These numbers suggest people are being vigilant about what they see online, and are standing up to make the digital world a safer place to live and work in. “This year has not been easy, but our team is so motivated, and know finding and removing these images is an important step in keeping the internet safe, and protecting children from harm.” A extensive welfare package was in place to look after the analysts’ mental health while performing their role, the IWF added. The figures come after law enforcement and child protection organisations warned that paedophiles were taking advantage of the pandemic to search for and carry out abuse online. During the pandemic tech firms had reduced the number of moderators tackling sexual abuse, giving offenders an “unprecedented opportunity” to target children who were spending more time online, they said."
"WhatsApp will soon have a disappearing message feature, designed to enable users of the chat app to cut down on their digital footprint. Once the update, which is rolling out from Thursday, hits phones, users will be able to set an option for each individual chat they are in – whether one-on-one or a group – to delete messages automatically seven days after they have been sent. Unlike some competitors, such as the secure messaging app Signal, WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, decided against offering flexibility to users. There is no option to change the length of time messages are stored, for instance; and the service also removes images and videos sent. “We’re starting with seven days because we think it offers peace of mind that conversations aren’t permanent, while remaining practical so you don’t forget what you were chatting about,” the company says in a blogpost. “The shopping list or store address you received a few days ago will be there while you need it, and then disappear after you don’t. “While it’s great to hold on to memories from friends and family, most of what we send doesn’t need to be everlasting. Our goal is to make conversations on WhatsApp feel as close to in-person as possible, which means they shouldn’t have to stick around forever.” Disappearing messages can be enabled by tapping the chat name at the top of the screen and scrolling down to a new option for “disappearing messages” to turn it on. Doing so does not delete older messages, and either member of a chat can turn the setting on or off, though in a group chat only administrators have control. As with other disappearing message options, users need to trust their friends. There is nothing to prevent the other party in a chat taking screenshots, or forwarding, messages they want to save for later. The new feature comes a month after WhatsApp launched a shopping service, integrating itself with Facebook more tightly than ever before. Users will now be able to message a company on the app, browse a catalogue of items for sale, and complete a purchase, all without needing to leave WhatsApp. The feature will also bring much-needed revenue to the company, since WhatsApp will, finally, start to charge companies for using its business tools. Shops that already have a Facebook presence will be able to operate directly on WhatsApp too, without needing to set up a second storefront. But that means that, for the first time, WhatsApp users could find that their activities on the chat app feed their advertising profile on Facebook itself. “When a person is interacting with a Facebook shop, those interactions, and the data about them will be used by Facebook,” Matt Idema, WhatsApp’s chief operating officer, told the Guardian. “So that includes things like what products you’re browsing, and items you may select or add for purchase.”"
"Nearly a week after the US government announced that multiple federal agencies had been targeted by a sweeping cyber-attack, the full scope and consequences of the suspected Russian hack remain unknown. Key federal agencies, from the Department of Homeland Security to the agency that oversees America’s nuclear weapons arsenal, were reportedly targeted, as were powerful tech and security companies including Microsoft. Investigators are still trying to determine what information the hackers may have stolen, and what they could do with it. After days of silence, Donald Trump on Saturday dismissed the hack, which federal officials said posed a “grave risk” to every level of government, and said it was “well under control”. Joe Biden has promised a tougher response to cyber-attacks but offered no specifics. Members of Congress are demanding more information about what happened, even as officials scrambling for answers call the attack “significant and ongoing”. Here’s a look at what we know, and what we still don’t, about the worst-ever cyber-attack on US federal agencies. What happened? The hack began as early as March, when malicious code was snuck into updates to a popular software called Orion, made by the company SolarWinds, which provides network-monitoring and other technical services to hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world, including most Fortune 500 companies and government agencies in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. That malware gave elite hackers remote access to an organization’s networks so they could steal information. The apparent months-long timeline gave the hackers ample opportunity to extract information from targets including monitoring email and other internal communications. Microsoft called it “an attack that is remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact”. Who has been affected? At least six US government departments, including energy, commerce, treasury and state, are reported to have been breached. The National Nuclear Security Administration’s networks were also breached, Politico reported on Thursday. Dozens of security and other technology firms, as well as non-governmental organizations, were also affected, Microsoft said on Thursday. While most affected by the attack were in the US, Microsoft said it had identified victims in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. “It’s certain that the number and location of victims will keep growing,” Microsoft added. Who is responsible for the attack? On Friday evening, secretary of state Mike Pompeo became the first Trump official to publicly confirm the attack was linked to Russia, telling a conservative radio host: “I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.” Previously, US officials speaking on condition of anonymity, as well as prominent cybersecurity experts, told media outlets they believed Russia was the culprit, specifically SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence outfit. Andrei Soldatov, an expert on Russia’s spy agencies and the author of The Red Web, told the Guardian he believes the hack was more likely a joint effort of Russia’s SVR and FSB, the domestic spy agency Vladimir Putin once led. Russia has denied involvement: “One shouldn’t unfoundedly blame the Russians for everything,” a Kremlin spokesman said. The infiltration tactic involved in the current hack, known as the “supply chain” method, recalled the technique Russian military hackers used in 2016 to infect companies that do business in Ukraine with the hard-drive-wiping NotPetya virus – the most damaging cyber-attack to date. What information has been stolen, and how is it being used? That remains unclear. “This hack was so big in scope that even our cybersecurity experts don’t have a real sense yet in the terms of the breadth of the intrusion itself,” Stephen Lynch, head of the House of Representatives oversight committee, said after attending a classified briefing on Friday. Thomas Rid, a Johns Hopkins cyber-conflict expert, told the Associated Press it was likely the hackers had harvested such a vast quantity of data that “they themselves most likely don’t know yet” what useful information they’ve stolen. What can be done to fix the networks that have been compromised? That’s also unclear, and potentially very difficult. “Removing this threat actor from compromised environments will be highly complex and challenging for organizations,” said a statement from the cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) on Thursday. One of Trump’s former homeland security advisers, Thomas Bossert, has said publicly that a real fix may take years, and be both costly and challenging. “It will take years to know for certain which networks the Russians control and which ones they just occupy,” Bossert wrote in the New York Times. “The logical conclusion is that we must act as if the Russian government has control of all the networks it has penetrated. “A ‘do-over’ is mandatory and entire new networks need to be built – and isolated from compromised networks.” How has Trump responded? For most of the week, the president said nothing. On Saturday morning, he sent a tweet dismissing the seriousness of the attack and contradicting his own officials’ statements about Russia’s responsibility. Officials at the White House had been prepared to put out a statement on Friday afternoon, accusing Russia of being “the main actor”, but were told at the last minute to stand down, the AP reported, citing a US official familiar with the conversations. The Republican senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized Trump’s long silence as unacceptable in response to an attack he said was “like Russian bombers have been repeatedly flying undetected over our entire country”. “Not to have the White House aggressively speaking out and protesting and taking punitive action is really, really quite extraordinary,” Romney said. Trump tweeted on Saturday that he was skeptical of holding Russia responsible, a statement made just hours after his secretary of state said publicly the attack was “clearly” linked to Russia. “Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens,” Trump tweeted, questioning, without any evidence, whether China might have been behind the attack instead. “Another day, another scandalous betrayal of our national security by this president,” Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House intelligence committee and led impeachment proceedings against Trump, said in response. How has Biden responded? So far, there’s been tough talk but no clear plan from the president-elect. “We need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber-attacks in the first place,” Biden said. “We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in coordination with our allies and partners. “There’s a lot we don’t yet know, but what we do know is a matter of great concern.” Could this attack have been prevented or deterred? “What we could have done is had a coherent approach and not been at odds with each other,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert and former National Security Council member, to PBS NewsHour, criticizing conflict and dysfunction within the Trump administration and between the US and allies on Russia-related issues. That dysfunction was on new display on Saturday, as Trump publicly disputed his own secretary of state’s explanation. If “we don’t have the president on one page and everybody else on another, and we’re working together with our allies to push back on this, that would have a serious deterrent effect”, Hill said. Other cybersecurity experts said the federal government could also do more to simply keep up to date on cybersecurity issues, and said the Trump administration had failed on this front, including by eliminating the positions of White House cybersecurity coordinator and state department cybersecurity policy chief. “It’s been a frustrating time, the last four years. I mean, nothing has happened seriously at all in cybersecurity,” Brandon Valeriano, a Marine Corps University scholar and adviser to a US cyber-defense commission, to the AP. What options does the US have to respond politically? Some experts are arguing the US needs to do more to punish Russia. The federal government could impose formal sanctions, as when the Obama administration expelled diplomats in retaliation for Kremlin military hackers’ meddling in Trump’s favor in the 2016 election. Or the US could fight back more covertly by, for instance, making public details of Putin’s financial dealings. But as the Guardian’s Luke Harding pointed out, cyber-attacks are “cheap, deniable, and psychologically effective”, and Biden’s options for responding are limited. “The answer eluded Barack Obama, who tried unsuccessfully to reset relations with Putin,” Harding wrote. “The person who led this doomed mission was the then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, herself a Russian hacking victim in 2016.” The state department said on Saturday the US was halting work at consulates in Vladivostock and Yekaterinburg, citing safety and security issues at facilities where operations had been curtailed because of Covid-19. The decision did not affect Russian consulates in the US, the department said, but the closures will leave the embassy in Moscow as the last US diplomatic mission in Russia. What are other potential consequences of the hack? SolarWinds may face legal action from customers and government entities affected by the breach. The company filed a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, detailing the hack. The company said total revenue from affected products was about $343m, or roughly 45% of its total revenue. SolarWinds’ stock price has fallen 25% since news of the breach first broke. Moody’s Investors Service said on Wednesday it was looking to downgrade its rating for the company, citing the “potential for reputational damage, material loss of customers, a slowdown in business performance and high remediation and legal costs”.

"Facebook is to pay mainstream UK news outlets millions of pounds a year to license their articles, as the social network faces the threat of a government crackdown over its dominance of online advertising. Most British newspaper groups have signed up to the programme, under which their articles will appear in a dedicated news section on the site that is due to launch in January. While most Facebook news consumption is currently through links shared on a user’s main newsfeed, the dedicated news tab will involve contractors paid by the social network selecting what they consider to be the main stories of the day from mainstream outlets. In return, publishers are being promised substantial cash sums and the promise of new readers. Facebook declined to comment on the amount of money it is putting into the scheme, but some publishers are privately expecting to make millions of pounds a year from the multi-year deals they have signed with the social network. As a result, news industry sources estimated that the total annual bill for Facebook is likely to run into the tens of millions in the UK alone, making a difference to the finances of struggling news outlets. “It’s an extremely large investment and it’s something we’ve done over multiple years,” said Sarah Brown, Facebook’s head of news partnerships in northern Europe. She said the curators would prioritise checks and balances associated with original reporting when choosing which stories to highlight: “Is it deeply sourced reporting, is it timely, is it offering an interesting angle, is it well sourced?” The Facebook News section will feature a mix of top stories chosen by curators employed by the news aggregator service Upday, alongside other stories chosen algorithmically to reflect a user’s interests. The outlets that have signed up to be launch partners include the Guardian, the Daily Mirror, the Independent, all the UK’s major regional news publishers, and magazines such as the Economist. Facebook said it hoped to add further publishers to the deal. Other news sites that have not agreed deals with Facebook, including hyperlocal sites, may still appear in the section if they meet certain criteria on standards. The direct cash injection will please a news industry that has largely lost out to Facebook in the battle for the UK advertising market. It also comes at a time when the social network is facing the threat of substantial government intervention from a new regulator designed to target its dominance of the online advertising market. Government sources have made clear that they want Google and Facebook to do more to support the finances of news publishers. • This article was amended on 1 December 2020. The people curating Facebook News will be contractors, not employees as an earlier version said due to an editing error."
"Apple’s first own-brand noise-cancelling headphones are heavy on the luxury and sound – but also on price. The AirPods Max cost £549 and are the most expensive of Apple’s headphones line that includes the £159 AirPods, £249 AirPods Pro and sets from the Beats brand such as the £270 Solo Pro and £300 Studio 3 Wireless. They share the AirPods name but the Max are a completely different beast, designed to beat the market leaders Bose and Sony in the premium noise-cancelling game. Comfortable and airy but weighty The Max are made of aluminium and stainless steel, which feel more luxurious than plastic but weigh 385g – 130g more than most rivals. The weight is primarily in the ear cups, not the headband, which makes them well balanced on your head. Tilt your head forward or back and the ear cups will move a little but the mesh headband stays in place. The ear cups are really comfortable. The pads are made out of memory foam covered in a woven fabric and do not make my ears sweat like some rivals can. The arms extend height adjustment and the ear cups tilt and rotate to fit the side of your head. The spring-loaded hinges apply firm but not overly strong pressure to keep the headphones in place. Once adjusted properly the Max are very comfortable even for extended periods. Specifications Weight: 384.8g Drivers: 40mm Connectivity: 2x Apple H1 chip, Bluetooth 5.0, Lightning charging Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC Battery life: 20 hours ANC on Connectivity and controls The Max have Apple’s H1 chips in them, the same as the AirPods Pro, which means they have the same strong Bluetooth 5 connection supporting SBC and AAC audio formats, plus instant pairing and seamless, automatic switching between Apple devices. They also have the option of having voice assistant access using the “Hey, Siri” wake word and having Siri read messages to you as they come in. It all works very well. Connectivity with other non-Apple devices was solid, but only Apple devices, such as an iPhone, can change settings and remotely control features such as the noise cancelling. The top of the right ear cup has a button for toggling noise cancelling modes; press and hold it to put the headphones into pairing mode or continue hold to reboot them. There is also an enlarged digital crown jog-dial button, as previously seen on the Apple Watch, which you turn for volume and press once, twice or thrice for playback controls. Press and hold it to invoke Siri. Both buttons are top notch. Oddly there is no power button. The headphones go into a standby state when taken off or put around your neck for a few minutes but only turn off when slipped into the case. Quality music The Max produce the sort of fantastic sound you should expect, joining a rare bunch alongside the B&amp;W PX7 and Sony WH-1000XM4 that sound so good you will be able to hear new elements in well-worn tracks. Bass is powerful and tightly controlled: present when needed but not overpowering. Mids are precise and do not dominate, while highs sparkle with energy and clarity. Every tone is finely balanced but they are not flat, with a pleasing, full and well-judged sound that is good at any volume. Grand orchestral scores delight with dynamic range and a wider sound than most. Subtle when needed, the Max can still highlight detail even in complex tracks such as The Who’s Baba O’Riley. They have plenty of punch in tracks such as Highly Suspicious by My Morning Jacket, aggression when needed in Dr Dre’s Next Episode and enough power to give a full rendition of the deep bass in Lindsey Stirling’s Crystallize. Miles Davis sounds particularly sumptuous and they can just as easily make the most out of high energy EDM as chilled-out downtempo. Bass heads looking for thumping low-end in every track will need to look elsewhere – there’s no equaliser to crank up – while they could be a touch more raw in grunge tracks such as the classic Smells Like Teen Spirit. Powerful movie sound The Max are unique in that the film audio performance is a bit different from music. In standard stereo, they produce more low-end grunt for explosions while keeping the dialogue clearly audible. But they also have a special spatial audio mode, which acts as surround sound but with just two speakers. This virtual surround sound is nothing new but how it works for the Max is novel. When fed a 5.1, 7.1 or Dolby Atmos sound track the Max use motion sensors to detect the position of your head in relation to the screen, creating a pretty convincing surround sound. You can turn your head but it will always sound like the dialogue is coming from the screen. You also get properly implemented low-frequency effects, which would normally be produced by a subwoofer in a surround setup. While it is genuinely great, it is disappointing that it works only with the iPhone and iPad as they have the sensors required to make it work. It does not work with the Apple TV set-top box or any other audio source. And it works for only a handful of apps at the moment, including the Apple TV app (Apple TV+ and iTunes) and Disney+. Great for watching on a train or plane, but a soundtrack that good deserves to have the movie playing on the best and biggest screen in the house. Top noise cancelling The Max have active noise cancelling, which uses microphones to detect unwanted incoming sound and produces anti-sound to cancel it before it hits your eardrum. Apple’s noise cancelling is easily as good as the best in the business, handling road noise, drone, fans, the sounds of roaring boiler or extractor fan just as well as Bose, B&amp;W or Sony. They also have a class-leading transparency mode that lets you hear the world around you, almost as if you were not wearing the headphones. They do, however, bleed sound more than competitors with people sitting across the room able to work out what was happening in a movie soundtrack when cranked up loud. Solid battery life The Max last for about 20 hours with noise cancelling on or longer with it off, matching Bose’s NCH 700 but 10 hours short of the B&amp;W PX7 or Sony WF-1000XM4. They lose 0.5% of battery an hour when left on standby out of their case. It takes about two hours to fully recharge the Max using a 5W or greater USB power adaptor. A five-minute charge will provide up to 90 minutes playback. They come with a USB-C to Lightning cable but not a power adaptor and cannot charge any faster with higher-power adaptors. Sustainability Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery in the AirPods Max, which is typically 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity for cells in other headphones, but it is replaceable costing £75 and the headphones are generally repairable. Replacement ear cushions cost £75 in various colours. The headphones are not made of recycled materials but are put together using renewable energy. Apple does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Observations Call quality is great – loud and clear on both ends of the call. When you take the headphones out of their case the metal sides clash before you rotate the ear cups. Price The Apple AirPods Max cost £549 in the UK or $549 in the US and come a choice of five colours. For comparison, the RRP for the AirPods is £159, the AirPods Pro cost £249, the Beats Solo Pro cost £269.95 and the Beats Studio 3 Wireless cost £299.95. The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 cost £349.95, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II cost £299.95, the Sony WH-1000XM4 cost £350, the B&amp;W PX7 cost £349.99, the Master and Dynamic MW65 cost £449 and the B&amp;O Beoplay H95 cost £700. Verdict The Apple AirPods Max are big, expensive and flashy noise cancelling-headphones that manage to stand out in a crowded market. They sound fantastic with most genres of music, brilliant with movies including some fancy virtual surround tech, plus superb noise cancelling that matches the best in the business. As with the firm’s earbuds, the new headphones have Apple-exclusive features, such as spatial audio, instant pairing and automatic switching. Plus seamless device switching, which also works with non-Apple gear. They are also some of the most comfortable headphones I have worn, particularly over long listening sessions, despite being heavier than most. But they cost £200 more than some exceedingly good headphones and I do not think they do much to justify the difference. You will also need to spend another £35 for the cable to use them with aeroplane entertainment systems. And the case/bra-thing is just weird, particularly because you need it to turn them off. I would not recommend them for non-Apple users, but if you are looking to splash the cash on a luxury set of noise-cancelling headphones with exquisite audio, the AirPods Max deliver. Pros: fantastic music quality, super comfortable, brilliant movie sound, spatial audio, excellent seamless switching, instant pairing with Apple gear, excellent controls, solid battery life, premium build. Cons: expensive, heavy, no headphone socket, no headphone cable included, no power button, weird case, no real protection included, only fold flat, bleed sound a little, need at least one Apple device for updates/settings.

"Four years ago, foreign actors leveraged social media to interfere in the US presidential election. This year, too, misinformation is among the greatest threats to American democracy, experts warn. With conspiracy theories such as QAnon flourishing, a president who regularly uses social media platforms to demonize his opponents or spread falsehoods about the election process, and a federal government that has done little to combat foreign election interference online, tech platforms’ responsibility in the 2020 election process has only grown. Reeling from criticism they have in past years failed to act decisively to curb those threats, major tech platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have announced broad steps to combat misinformation ahead of the 3 November vote. The measures range from changing algorithmic recommendations to limiting users’ abilities to share falsehoods. But some experts are doubtful the changes, enacted as hundreds of thousands of Americans have already cast votes, are sufficient. Others have criticized the lack of transparency into how these changes are applied. “I am concerned right now the future of our democracy is in the hands of very few people at these tech companies,” said Lisa Fazio, a professor at Vanderbilt University who studies the spread of misinformation. As mail-in ballots pour in from around the United States, here are notable changes in policy and practices from the biggest social media platforms affecting discourse around the elections. Facebook and Instagram: ‘too little too late’ Facebook has instituted a slew of new policies around the electoral process and misleading claims by politicians. The measures also apply to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. The company placed an outright ban on content that seeks to intimidate voters or interfere with voting, after Trump encouraged his supporters to “watch” people at the polls in a manner some said was threatening. Since 10 October, it has been featuring information panels and videos at the top of the news feed regarding voting, offering state-specific tips on how to vote by mail in both English and in Spanish. It launcheda “voter information center” that includes posts from verified election authorities on news related to the voting process, guidance on voter registration, and other information on planning when and where to vote. Facebook said it has helped an estimated 2.5 million people register to vote this year through this center. It said it would stop accepting new political advertising one week before election day and would stop running political ads indefinitely starting 3 November, the day of the election “to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse”. It will label posts from candidates that claim victory prematurely. If a candidate declared the winner by major media outlets is contested by another candidate or party, the platform will show the name of the declared winner in a banner at the top of its pages. It plans to label posts from presidential candidates with the declared winner’s name and a link to the Voting Information Center. And it began to label false or misleading posts from public figures, including Trump. In September, Facebook for the first time added a label underneath a post from Trump casting doubt on mail-in voting and encouraging supporters to vote twice, saying that mail-in voting has been historically trustworthy. Most of the changes, however, are “too little, too late” said Jim Steyer, founder and chief executive officer of children’s online safety non-profit Common Sense Media. Steyer’s organization was one of several behind the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which in July persuaded more than 1,000 companies to stop advertising on Facebook due to its content management policies. “They have allowed the amplification of hate, racism and misinformation at a scale unprecedented in my lifetime,” he said. Steyer did concede the addition of voter information centers on Facebook was a positive step toward ensuring a fair and free election. “I do commend them for making accurate voter information available,” Steyer said. “But they should still stop the disinformation more proactively.” Twitter: good decisions that take too long Like Facebook, Twitter has instituted measures to combat misinformation and appears to be planning for the event that election results are delayed or contested. Twitter has created an elections “hub” at the top of the explore page for US users. It will feature news in English and Spanish from reputable sources as well as live streams of major election events. The platform in October ruled that users may not claim an election win before it is called and cannot tweet claims or orders meant to interfere with election processes. It said it would also remove “false or misleading information intended to undermine public confidence in an election or other civic process”, “disputed claims” that could undermine faith in the process, and “misleading claims” about the outcome of an election. For example, Twitter in September put a “public interest” notice on a Trump tweet that shared misinformation about voting. As part of the policy, Twitter doesn’t allow retweets of such posts . Users may quote-tweet some of them to add context. The platform has also introduced a new feature that prevents users from retweeting articles without having read them. Twitter’s measures to limit the shares of misleading election information are likely to have a positive effect on election integrity, said Fazio, the Vanderbilt professor. “It is useful to stop the spread of misinformation and falsehoods, no matter who that falsehood comes from,” she said. She cautioned it may be difficult to determine which posts are egregious enough to get a warning label and wondered whether the company’s policy to block readers from retweeting articles without having read them is helpful or “just annoying to readers”. Twitter said when it tested the feature on limited users during the summer 33% more people opened the link than did without the warning. “I’ve been pleased so far with Twitter’s decisions,” Fazio concluded. “They are just often taking too long.” YouTube: ‘rabbit holes with more extremism’ YouTube has few new policies relating to the 2020 elections, despite its reputation as a hotbed for misinformation and conspiracy theories. The video-sharing platform highlighted in a recent blogpost how its existing policies would apply to election-related content, and has been surfacing “information panels” with context on election-related search results on the platform. YouTube pledges to remove “content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads users (beyond clips taken out of context) and may pose a serious risk of egregious harm”. The most high-profile example of this was when it removed a video of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that was manipulated to make her appear intoxicated. The platform also bans content that contains hacked information that may “interfere with democratic processes, such as elections and censuses”. It also said it will remove content “encouraging others to interfere with democratic processes”, citing an example such as telling viewers to create long voting lines with the purpose of making it harder for others to vote. Like Facebook and Twitter, YouTube has created a voting information panel to appear on searches related to 2020 presidential or federal congressional candidates. This will include content such as how to register to vote and links to official state websites for more information. Fazio said YouTube could benefit from changes like those made to Twitter to limit algorithmic recommendations that may expose users to misinformation or radicalized content. “I can see how people think it would be helpful to show related content, but in many cases it is sending users down rabbit holes with more extremism,” she said. Meanwhile, YouTube on election day will be plastered with ads from Trump after his campaign secured the highly- trafficked ad space with the platform earlier this year. TikTok: strengthening past efforts TikTok’s existing disinformation policy prohibits “content that misleads community members about elections or other civic processes”. The company announced measures to “strengthen these efforts” in a blogpost in August. The measures include an update on its policies to clarify what is allowed on TikTok. The company, which is Chinese-owned, is also working with the Department of Homeland Security to protect against foreign influences on TikTok. The platform already partners with the World Health Organization to create pop-ups citing credible information on coronavirus-related content to prevent the spread of misinformation. It has expanded its partnerships to “help verify election-related misinformation” and now works with third-party factchecking organizations, including the Poynter Institute and its MediaWise program, Science Feedback, Lead Stories, and Vishvas News to do so. Like other platforms, it has launched an in-app guide to the 2020 elections, telling users how to vote and connecting them with additional information from trusted sources such as BallotReady and the National Association of Secretaries of State."
"Mark Zuckerberg told Facebook staffers on Thursday that former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon had not violated enough of the company’s policies to justify his suspension from the platform when he called for the beheading of two US officials and the posting of their heads outside the White House as a “warning”. Bannon appeared to endorse violence against the FBI director, Christopher Wray, and the infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on an episode of his podcast on 5 November. The podcast, the War Room, was distributed in video form on a number of social media outlets, including Facebook. Twitter banned Bannon’s War Room account permanently, saying it had suspended the podcast account for violating its policy on the glorification of violence. Facebook removed the video after about 10 hours online, but did not suspend the account. “We have specific rules around how many times you need to violate certain policies before we will deactivate your account completely,” Zuckerberg told an all-staff meeting on Thursday. “While the offenses here, I think, came close to crossing that line, they clearly did not cross the line.” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters the company would take further action against Bannon’s page “if there are additional violations”. Last Friday, Facebook took down a network of other Bannon-linked pages that were pushing false claims about the presidential election, after they were flagged by activist group Avaaz. Avaaz said seven of the largest pages had amassed nearly 2.5 million followers. Stone said Facebook had removed “several clusters of activity for using inauthentic behavior tactics to artificially boost how many people saw their content”. Bannon could not immediately be reached for comment. During Thursday’s meeting, Zuckerberg also acknowledged criticism from Joe Biden, and said the company shared some of the Biden team’s concerns about social media. Biden told the New York Times’ editorial board in December last year that he had “never been a fan of Facebook” and considered Zuckerberg “a real problem”. Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, criticized the social media platform for their handling of the election in a series of tweets on Monday. “If you thought disinformation on Facebook was a problem during our election, just wait until you see how it is shredding the fabric of our democracy in the days after,” he wrote."
"The Apple Watch gets a bigger, better screen, faster charging and a small price cut for 2021, which is enough to keep it at the top of the smartwatch market. The Series 7 version costs from £369 ($399/A$599) and, despite being £10 cheaper than last year’s Series 6, is Apple’s most expensive smartwatch, above the Watch SE costing from £249 ($279/A$429). It requires an iPhone 6S or newer and does not work with Android. The Series 7 comes in 41 or 45mm case sizes, both 1mm taller than their predecessors and thinner bezels mean the screens are 20% larger. Every extra pixel on a device as small as a smartwatch counts. On-screen buttons are bigger and easier to tap. More text fits on the display or fonts can be made larger and easier to read. New watch faces can fit two full-size information widgets at once, and there’s a new full qwerty keyboard for typing out messages that is exclusive to the Series 7. None of these additions are revolutionary, but they are good refinements to the current Apple Watch formula. Specifications Case size: 41 or 45mm Case thickness: 10.7mm Weight: 32/38.8g, 42.3/51.5g or 37/45.1g depending on material and size Processor: S7 RAM: 1GB Storage: 32GB Operating system: WatchOS 8 Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: gyro, HR, ECG, blood oxygen, microphone, speaker, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeter Connectivity: Bluetooth 5, wifi n, NFC, ultra wideband, optional 4G/eSIM Slick performance, 36-hour battery life The new S7 chip matches the performance of last year’s S6, making the Series 7 the fastest, smoothest and slickest smartwatch you can buy. Battery life is the same, too, lasting about 36 hours between charges with sleep tracking overnight and the screen on all of the time during the day. Tracking a 35-minute run consumed 7% of the battery, so it should manage a marathon or two. Sustainability Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery in the Series 7. Batteries in similar devices typically last at least 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. The battery can be replaced for £82.44. Repairs cost between £286.44 and £462.44 depending on the model, while repair specialists iFixit awarded the Series 7 a repairability score of 6 out of 10. The Series 7 includes 100% recycled aluminium, 99% recycled tungsten and rare earth elements, and 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main chips. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impact in its report. WatchOS 8 and health tracking The Series 7 runs the same watchOS 8 software as every Apple Watch from 2015’s Series 3. It adds a portrait photo watch face, the “focus” notification handlings from iOS 15 and the ability to set more than one timer at once. It also adds better text entry including the ability to use combinations of dictation, scribble, emojis and a full qwerty keyboard. There is also a redesigned meditation app that melds breathing coaching with mindfulness. WatchOS 8 is the best supported and most capable smartwatch operating system available, despite recent advances by Google with WearOS. You can expect at least five years or longer of software support, including feature and security updates, which is far longer than smartwatch rivals. The Series 7 has the same comprehensive health-tracking features as the Series 6, including the ability to take ECG for heart rhythm, blood oxygen level monitoring and fitness tracking across a large range of workout types. Only dedicated multisport watches track more metrics across running, cycling and adventure sports. Observations Sleep tracking now includes respiration rate, but not sleep cycles like some competitors. The Apple Watch can be used to unlock an iPhone with Face ID when wearing a mask, which is extremely convenient. Bands made for older Apple Watch models fit the Series 7. Price The Apple Watch Series 7 comes in two sizes, three different materials and models with the option of 4G that requires an eSIM and compatible phone plan add-on. The aluminium or Nike versions in 41mm size cost £369 ($399/A$599) or £399 ($429/A$649). 4G models cost an extra £100 ($100/A$150). Stainless steel and titanium models cost more. For comparison, the Apple Watch SE costs £249, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 costs £249, the Fitbit Sense costs £279.99 and the Garmin Venu 2 costs £299. Verdict There wasn’t a lot wrong with last year’s Series 6, so a bigger, better screen and faster charging add to an already winning experience. It is still expensive, even if it is £10 cheaper than last year, and the lack of third-party watch faces means you’re stuck using only those that are built in. Sleep tracking could be better, too, but the rest of the health features are top-class. It is not worth upgrading from a recent Apple Watch. But for those with worn-out models or looking for their first smartwatch for the iPhone, the Apple Watch Series 7 is the best you can buy. Pros: excellent haptic vibrations, larger and better always-on screen, ECG, top health tracking, great activity tracking, 50m water resistance, solid battery, long software support, recycled aluminium. Cons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, sleep tracking still not great, blood oxygen data not that useful, no third-party watch faces, not a giant upgrade.

"We all fear our smartphones spy on us, and I’m subject to a new type of surveillance. An app called TapCounter records each time I touch my phone’s screen. My swipes and jabs are averaging about 1,000 a day, though I notice that’s falling as I steer shy of social media to meet my deadline. The European company behind it, QuantActions, promises that through capturing and analysing the data it will be able to “detect important indicators related to mental/neurological health”. Arko Ghosh is the company’s cofounder and a neuroscientist at Leiden University in the Netherlands. “Tappigraphy patterns” – the time series of my touches – can, he says, confidently be used not only to infer slumber habits (tapping in the wee hours means you are not sleeping) but also mental performance level (the small intervals in a series of key-presses represent a proxy for reaction time), and he has published work to support it. QuantActions plans to launch features based on those insights next year. But further into the future, Ghosh would like to use the technology for medical reasons, including to predict seizures in people with epilepsy. This year Ghosh published a small clinical study of people with epilepsy that shows how subtle changes in smartphone tappigraphy alone could be used to infer abnormalities in their brainwaves. “Our hope is that some day we can forecast upcoming episodes,” says Ghosh. Ghosh’s work and my taps are part of the new but rapidly developing field called digital phenotyping. It aims to take the huge amounts of raw data that can be continuously collected from people’s use of smartphones, wearables and other digital devices and analyse them using artificial intelligence (AI) to infer behaviour related to health and disease. If symptom-related digital signals – called digital biomarkers – can be properly teased out, it could provide a new route for diagnosing or monitoring a range of medical conditions, particularly those relating to mental or brain health. Early research suggests patterns in geolocation data may correlate with episodes of depression and relapses in schizophrenia; certain keystroke patterns could predict mania in bipolar disorder; and the way toddlers gaze at a smartphone screen could be used to detect autism. Data streams include smartphone activity logs, measurements from any of a phone’s built-in sensors (such as the GPS, accelerometer or light sensor) as well as user-generated content, which can be mined for words or phrases. “It is classic big-data analytics… repurposing data for reasons other than it was primarily collected,” says Brit Davidson, an assistant professor of analytics at the University of Bath, UK who has been critically watching the field develop. The technology is attracting big tech companies’ interest. In September, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on iPhone features to help diagnose depression and cognitive decline. Others, such as Google, are also reportedly interested. Apple is probably hoping it is going to be able to correlate various phone indices with other indices it considers show mental health disorders, says Helen Christensen, a professor of mental health at the University of New South Wales in Australia who also leads the nonprofit Black Dog Institute, focused on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mood disorders. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley-based consumer health and wellness startups are already incorporating aspects of the technology into their products, albeit not yet for clinical diagnosis. Mindstrong provides therapy and psychiatry services virtually and has received tens of millions in funding, including from Jeff Bezos’s venture capital firm. It claims to use patented technology to track how clients tap, scroll and click on their phones so its clinicians can provide “more personalised care”. Though it isn’t described on its website, a spokesperson for Ginger, which offers on-demand mental health support, confirmed the company uses a “relatively rudimentary form” of digital phenotyping algorithm to analyse text conversations between users and its coaches to provide insights. Transparency about what some companies are doing can be lacking, notes Nicole Martinez-Martin, a bioethicist at Stanford University in California who focuses on digital health technology. Traditionally, diagnosing mental illness has relied on self-reported experiences and medical assessment conducted at a clinic. But it captures just one point in time and can be highly subjective. Digital phenotyping offers the possibility of collecting continuous behavioural data capturing a person’s lived experiences. “It could give us a more accurate way to diagnose people,” says Jukka-Pekka Onnela, a biostatistician at Harvard University, Massachusetts, who has helped pioneer digital phenotyping and has a number of ongoing projects in the area including with industry (Onnela is also part of the leadership team of a large research collaboration with Apple to study women’s health including by tracking menstrual cycles via the iPhone). It could also – in a world where mental health problems are increasing and services are stretched – make things cheaper, quicker and more efficient. People could manage their own mental health better and those who aren’t aware they have a problem could be alerted. “It is worth investigating,” says Christensen. “If we can find that this data is relevant… it would be a big breakthrough.” Cogito Companion illustrates how the technology might one day be used. It is an experimental decision support tool intended for use by clinicians to help diagnose mood and anxiety disorders. Developed by the Boston-based startup Cogito with funding from the Pentagon’s research agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), the company is working towards being able to use it medically for veterans and military personnel and it is currently being clinically trialled in 750 sailors returning from overseas deployments. (Cogito has also fed the technology into an AI coaching product to help call centre staff be more empathic, which it sells commercially.) Installed as an app on a participant’s phone, the tool passively looks for signs of collapses in social interactions and indications that activities are being avoided by examining changes in text and call patterns and mobility data. It also looks for signals of depressed mood by analysing not what is said but the way participants speak in short voice diaries they record. About 200 different signals from the voice, from energy to pauses to intonation, are analysed, says Skyler Place, chief behavioural science officer for Cogito, adding that an overall “risk score” is then sent to the person’s clinician to aid diagnosis and support. Yet while there is a lot of promise, the science of digital phenotyping has a long way to go; there are questions about privacy and whether it is a technology that will best serve society. First, much work is required to prove that meaningful medical information can be derived. Many of the published academic studies have been very small pilot studies. Ghosh’s epilepsy study, for example, involved only eight people. The only scientific work Mindstrong’s website cites to support its product is a single study of 27 people. If the algorithms are to be used for medical purposes, studies will need to involve many thousands, says Christensen. And pilots are now giving way to some larger studies. The current trial of the Cogito Companion builds on a smaller proof-of-concept study. Some research is beginning to include healthy people too (the pilot studies often include only those who already have certain conditions). The BiAffect study, a research effort focused on keystroke behaviour to predict bipolar episodes run by researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has an open science component that allows the public to download an app and take part so that differences between healthy adults and those with bipolar disorder can be better understood. It has about 2,000 participants. Apple’s interest in smartphone diagnosis appears to stem from previously announced research collaborations to study digital biomarkers of depression and anxiety with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and mild cognitive impairment with pharmaceutical giant Biogen (which also has a controversial new drug to treat it). Both are gathering a wide range of data from participants’ iPhones and Apple Watches and combining them with survey responses and cognitive tests. The UCLA study started with a pilot phase of 150 people and is due to continue with a main phase tracking 3,000 participants, which will also include healthy people. The Biogen study, which began in September, plans to enrol a mix of participants – 23,000 in total – and includes recruitment from the general population. The primary scientific challenge for the field, experts say, is that the data is so noisy. People use their phones so differently, it can be hard to compare behaviour between individuals or even in the same person over time. Links between online and offline behaviour can also be unclear. As Brit Davidson points out, a sudden drop in smartphone-based communication could be a sign of social withdrawal, or it might mean someone is communicating face-to-face instead. There is also the potential for bias in algorithms – well documented in other AI-based technology – that can mean certain groups of people are affected in negative ways or don’t end up benefiting from the technology. A lot of health-related research tends to use white, more affluent and educated populations, notes Stanford’s Martinez-Martin. “How it transfers is a big question,” she says. Privacy issues also loom. While data gathered for academic research studies follows strict protocols, things can get murkier with data gathered by private companies. Data that includes predictive inferences made with digital phenotyping approaches can be shared by companies in ways that not everyone is aware of but that could have impacts, says Martinez-Martin. “These inferences could be of interest to employers, insurers or education providers and they could use them in ways that are detrimental,” she says. And just because data is “deidentified” – made anonymous – doesn’t mean it can’t be reidentified in some way. And while there is protection under US law for sensitive health information, it generally relates to that collected in healthcare systems only – not by tech companies. In any case, it is unclear that established definitions of sensitive health information include the kind of information that digital phenotyping strives to collect. “The old system of protecting what we thought of as sensitive data is not really appropriate for this new digital world,” says Martinez-Martin. There is also the possibility that digital phenotyping will disrupt or compete with doctors. What if an algorithm’s assessment comes to be viewed by doctors or patients as more objective? What happens if a tool’s recommendations differ from a physician’s? Technology does have a place within mental health services and using software to help spot signs of mental health problems is interesting, says Rosie Weatherley, information content manager at the mental health charity Mind. “[But] human interaction and professional clinical judgment are not replaceable and should remain an essential component of a patient’s experience of diagnosis, accessing treatment and support.” Lisa Cosgrove, a professor of counselling psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston who studies social justice issues in psychiatry, raises a more philosophical issue. Digital phenotyping’s intense focus on the individual deflects attention away from what can be the upstream socio-political causes of mental health issues such as job loss, eviction or discrimination. “Certainly there’s a place for individual care… but digital phenotyping misses the context in which people experience emotional distress,” she says. Ghosh, however, is hopeful that the field can be beneficial to society. To have the data available for research is such a new phenomenon; time and effort are needed to study it. “We need to make sure we are actually helping people and not disturbing their lives,” he says."
"Questions over worker safety at Amazon are intensifying once again after a tornado struck an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, on Friday, leaving six people dead and another hospitalized. On Monday, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) said it had opened a workplace safety investigation into the warehouse collapse. Amazon said it was “supporting Osha” and that Osha opens investigations into all workplace fatality incidents. Meanwhile, workers and activists are calling for more action. Concerns over labor rights at the e-commerce giant have been mounting, exacerbated by allegations the company failed to “adequately notify” workers and health officials of Covid-19 cases. “This incident calls into question so much of Amazon’s practices in their warehouses,” said Marcos Ceniceros, an organizer at Warehouse Workers for Justice. “This is not the first time we’ve seen workers suffer at Amazon and we want to make sure that they’re not continuing to cut corners and putting workers at risk.” Warehouse Workers for Justice has called for a hearing in the Illinois state legislature examining what led to the deaths at Amazon’s warehouse. They are also calling on the company to ensure it has safety and training protocols in place for extreme weather events and other risks, like Covid-19, in the future. Speaking to the Intercept on Monday, 12 Amazon workers described concerns over workplace safety. Some said they had never experienced a tornado or fire drill on the job, and several said they would be uncertain of what to do in an emergency. An Amazon spokeswoman told the Guardian the company does require training in its facilities. “Emergency response training is provided to new employees and that training is reinforced throughout the year,” she said. John Gasper, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, cautioned that he didn’t know the particulars of what happened at Amazon. But he said for companies like Amazon that have high turnover in labor, it likely is harder to conduct regular emergency training schedules, particularly during the busy holiday season when there are many seasonal workers. “The cost of the time to do the drills is also time they are not [moving] the packages,” he said. “They have to think about these tradeoffs. But I don’t think any company wants to harm its employees.” Amazon said workers at the warehouse had little time to prepare when the National Weather Service declared a tornado warning on Friday night. The tornado arrived soon after, collapsing both sides of the warehouse and caving in its roof. “There was a tremendous effort that happened that night to keep everybody safe,” said John Felton, Amazon’s senior vice-president of global delivery services, speaking alongside the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, in Edwardsville on Monday and pledging a review of all the events that took place Friday. An Amazon spokesperson, Kelly Nantel, said the warehouse received tornado warnings between 8.06pm and 8.16pm on Friday and site leaders directed workers to immediately take shelter. At 8.27pm, the tornado struck the building. Felton said most of the 46 people in the warehouse known as a “delivery station” headed to a shelter on the north side, which ended up “nearly undamaged” and a smaller group to the harder-hit south end. The company said those are not separate safe rooms, but generally places away from windows considered safer than other parts of the plant. Amazon has pledged to assist workers and their families affected by the tragedy, including donating $1m to the Edwardsville Community Foundation. The company declined to answer questions on Monday about its disaster plans at the plant, including whether employees were required to perform drills. The tornado that hit Amazon’s facility was part of a swarm of twisters across the midwest and south that leveled entire communities. Another tornado destroyed a candle factory in Mayfield, Kentucky, killing multiple workers on an overnight shift. Osha, which is part of the US Department of Labor, said federal investigators were not investigating the Kentucky factory collapse because the state has its own workplace safety agency. Ceniceros said as extreme weather intensifies due to the climate crisis, workers are investigating how to protect themselves and hold corporations accountable. The Edwardsville warehouse is part of a vast patchwork of concrete-and-steel structures that have popped up in the St Louis region over the past decade, drawn by its confluence of major highways and railroads, cheap costs and Americans’ expectations for getting packages delivered soon after they click a link to order them. A researcher who studies the warehouse industry and the pressure put on Amazon workers to meet strict productivity quotas said even if Amazon’s team did everything right in responding to a devastating tornado, it raises the question about the structure of enormous warehouses popping up across the midwest as some climate experts warn of more frequent and severe storms. “We don’t think of warehousing as one of the industries that’s going to be severely impacted by climate change but then you have a case like this,” said Beth Gutelius, research director at the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois-Chicago. At the governor’s press conference Monday, Nantel emphasized that the 1.1m sq ft building was “constructed consistent with code”. But Pritzker raised the possibility that current codes aren’t enough to meet the dangers of increasingly devastating storms. He said there will be an investigation into updating code ,“given serious change in climate that we are seeing across the country”. Marc Wulfraat, a supply chain consultant who has studied Amazon’s warehouses and distribution centers, says the one in Edwardsville appeared standard for the industry with 40ft concrete walls, not unlike many others popping up around the country as consumers shift from stores to online buying. “It was basically a warehouse, with nothing particularly distinctive to Amazon,” said Wulfratt, president of MWPVL International, a consultancy in Montreal. “They abide by code when they put these buildings up. There is no way around it.” Gutelius said she couldn’t help but view the tragedy as a spillover effect of American consumer demand for getting packages shipped quickly. “Yes, it was a freak accident, but the facts are still that these workers were making sure my dog gets a frisbee – tomorrow – and gave their life for it,” she said. “It seems really kind of ridiculous when you think about what the stakes are.” The Associated Press contributed to this report"
"What does Mark Zuckerberg care about? The 37-year-old tech executive has a wife, two kids, $110bn , and near absolute control over a group of companies – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp – that shape the information, entertainment, and communication of 3 billion people. But in a year that kicked off with those companies playing a major role in fueling a violent and conspiracy-addled riot at the US Capitol on 6 January, and closed with a whistleblower revealing just how much Facebook knew – and concealed from the public – about the damage it was doing to individuals and societies, Zuckerberg has himself seemed remarkably unbothered. Gone is the Zuckerberg who repeated apologies and pledges to take a broader view of Facebook’s responsibility ad nauseum. New Zuck (dare we call him “metaZuck”?) appears to be primarily focused on his super relatable hobbies (electric surfing, fencing, hydrofoiling, boar hunting) and building a fantasy world that he hasn’t managed to mess up – yet. “I just decided to focus more on some of the awesome things we’re building, and doing more fun things with my family and friends,” Zuckerberg said to a fan who asked about the secret to his being “super laid-back and funny these last few months”. The Guardian would have loved to ask Zuckerberg some follow-up questions about that, but since metaZuck isn’t doing much in the way of sitting for interviews with critical journalists these days, we fell back upon a last resort: we built another Zuckerbot and interviewed it instead. To do this, we worked with Botnik Studios to create a predictive keyboard trained on the past two years of Zuckerberg’s public statements (archived by Marquette University’s Zuckerberg Files). Our previous interview with the Zuckerbot, conducted in 2019 and based on Zuck’s statements from 2016 to 2019, can be found here. Guardian journalists provided the questions; Botnik used the predictive keyboard to generate the answers. Hi Mark, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to the Guardian. It’s been a busy two years since we spoke, and your company has now been implicated in even more violence and unrest around the world. Congratulations! Thank you for welcoming me here today with your own self. Being present with you in person is going to be a killer part of history. To start, you recently changed Facebook’s name to Meta. Why? Imagine a multiplayer game where you pay off a bunch of publications who are physically afraid of content. This is the basic idea behind the internet. Now look up at the sun, close your eyes, feel completely wrapped in virtual goods and commerce. That is the ultimate expression of social networks. That is the metaverse. Can you share any details about what kinds of new experiences will be possible in the metaverse? We tested a model where a big Priscilla avatar fried people using an energy field if they said false things about my friends, and I think it’s going to unlock a lot of new community policies. The metaverse is really just about playing video games, right? The metaverse is a big, valuable baked dumpling full of content without nudity. How long do you think it will take for Meta to be implicated in a campaign of genocide or ethnic violence? The hardest technology to deliver is peace. We built tools that businesses can go, “OK, look at this inflection point. Now we’re entering into the metaverse. Blood conflict is just spam. Thank you, but I never want extreme stuff.” This vision is a reality if you peer through a custom headset. Do you have another name lined up for the rebrand after that? We have some fun brands around at this company for the last year of the metaverse. I really love “Click and Forget”, and then there is “Civilization Meats”, and we took a very different direction with “Earth Problem From Facebook”. We have a lot of these, so we think we’ll be awesome for a few years. Facebook has shown itself to be utterly incapable of policing its platform in this universe. What makes you think things will be better in the metaverse? Think about the metaverse as a symptom of our existence and you will actually feel completely hot for businesses. I believe that we’re building a type of modern relationship where people are spending time grilling with their sentient loans. Recently, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen left the company with a trove of documents that were shared with major news outlets. What is your response to her release of research showing that Facebook knew its products were harming society, and frequently failed to act? I think that people like that are big challenges that we’re dealing with all the time. We built a robot to go back to the beginning of Facebook and deleted all the data, so that’s going to be pretty cool in the past. The documents reveal that Facebook spends about 90% of its resources fighting misinformation on the United States, and 10% on the rest of the world, while about 10% of Facebook’s users are in the United States, and 90% are in the rest of the world. How do you justify that? In the world, we can do nothing to help. In America, we have to deal with senators and Elected Joe, so we build systems that stop terrorists from hacking your news. In VR, you can teleport to the news publishers’ newsroom and ask them if the information is real (they are going to misuse this, but it’s going to be really exciting to see). You appear to have spent a lot of time in recent years focused on your hobbies: hydrofoiling, e-surfing, VR fencing, boar hunting, and destroying democracy. What’s your secret to maintaining a good work-life balance? I am reminded of my favorite multiplayer experience: values. These are really important for relationships and I think generally they are the future of communication. So much fun for me to sit down with some pretty fundamental values and interests like Peloton bike and augmented traffic and just think about all kinds of topics. Instagram has stolen stories from Snapchat, Reels from Tiktok and IGTV from YouTube. What future plans do you have for further IP theft? We all want to take advantage of creators like that, but there’s a different way – yeah, I mean, basically just going in their data to help me to a compelling version of the issues, then also log in to the same tools that they were trying to work on and, um, we will actually be able to have their content remotely deleted. The metaverse is going to support that. Will you let your own children use Instagram, given your own company’s research into how harmful it can be to children’s mental health? Teenagers have a lot of ways to express their views on the internet and now they have one more; they can monetize their families with our “family permanence experience”. You were raised Jewish and have said religion is very important to you. How do you think God will judge you? I believe deeply in a wireless experience you have in the Next Time. You get a mentor and you see a cool effect, and then you go to juvenile detention center in the metaverse. It has a massive amount of problematic goods and it has solar-powered privacy controls that you can break by talking. And it has a major part with a judgment room, right in the top. In this room we are always faced by ourselves. This is inspiring for a second, but it starts to be clear that you are very afraid. That’s gonna be a big part of the challenge in the world to come. You control a 55% voting stake in your company. What safeguards exist to check your power? I need to ask permission from a big personal influence – my parents. They don’t expect that their friends will like the new things I’ve done. Hopefully, later on helping me will become their lives but for now we’re gonna roll with social media for all kinds of ages. Let’s play a game. What are two truths and one lie about yourself? One: I have no company. Two: I have no tolerance for the town square. Three: I do surfing and I am grateful for the world of water. Do you still think Facebook is making the world a better place? The world is going to end, and if we don’t make money from that, then we should just sit down in the water and make Reels right into the last couple of days."
"The technology in the Coalition’s cut-down version of the NBN cost up to three times more than originally forecast and was closer to the initial estimated cost of a revised version of Labor’s full-fibre plan, according to figures the government has sought to keep secret for almost a decade. The previously redacted 2013 figures detailing the estimated cost of the Coalition’s alternative model – relying on trouble-plagued pay-TV cables and fibre-to-the-node technology – show the true scale of the NBN cost blowout over the past eight years. When the Coalition won government in 2013, then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull commissioned a strategic review into the national broadband network to validate switching from rolling out fibre-to-the-premises for 93% of homes to a mixture of older technology using Telstra and Optus cable networks and fibre-to-the-node which then utilised existing copper lines to premises. The report, released in December 2013, claimed the former Labor government’s model would cost $74bn and not be completed until 2024, while the Coalition’s model would cost $41bn and be finished in 2020. For years large sections of the report have been kept secret, including crucial estimates on how much it would cost to build each type of technology out to each home. But the redacted figures, obtained by Guardian Australia, show NBN Co in 2013 estimated the cost of using the hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) pay-TV cable networks was between $800 and $850 per premises. The cost of building fibre-to-the-node was estimated to be $600 to $650 per premises. In reality, as NBN Co encountered upgrade issues with both types of technology, the cost has been up to three times higher. The average cost per premises for fibre-to-the-node is sitting at $2,330 and HFC is at $2,752, according to the latest figures detailed in the company’s 2021 corporate plan. NBN Co argues the current cost should not be compared to the 2013 estimate because the current methodology is “more comprehensive and includes additional cost elements”. “Since 2015, NBN Co has reported fully allocated costs for its … calculations, which has included all material costs of building a connection from the transit network to customers’ premises, incorporating costs such as payments to Telstra to lease duct infrastructure,” a spokesperson said this week. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In 2015, NBN Co began including a $700 infrastructure cost in determining the cost per premises, according to its corporate plan. Taking this cost away from the 2021 figures, both HFC and fibre-to-the-node are still more than double the original estimated cost. The review numbers have been a closely-guarded secret within NBN Co and the government for years. NBN Co has claimed “commercial sensitivity” to obstruct the release of the unredacted strategic review, arguing it would put the company at a competitive disadvantage if contractors knew the company’s estimates. Earlier this year, the company refused to provide the figures to the Senate, arguing it would “require a significant diversion of resources” to determine what could be released almost eight years on. Guardian Australia asked the office of the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, about the cost blowout, and whether the strategic review had vastly underestimated the cost of the multi-technology mix. A spokesperson for the minister did not address the questions directly, but said up to 75% of premises would be able to access ultrafast broadband by 2023, through upgrades building on the current model. “This will occur via a continuation of the ‘multi-technology model’ that has been used to deliver this enormous project efficiently and economically – and in time for the extra demands placed on the network due to Covid-19,” they said. During the 2016 election campaign, the Australian federal police raided the home of a Labor staffer and parliament offices over the leak of documents related to delays and cost blowouts associated with the Coalition’s version of the NBN. The cost of a “radically redesigned” fibre-to-the-premises NBN was also estimated in the report but was also redacted. The figures show it was estimated that design changes to the NBN would generate savings of $850-$1,150 per premises for full-fibre, with the final cost totalling $1,950-$2,250 per home. This confirms reporting by Nine newspapers earlier this year that the radically redesigned fibre network could have been at least $10bn cheaper than initially estimated – costing as little as $60bn when taking into account lower interest rates NBN has been paying on debt. The cost of building fibre networks has come down since 2013. In New Zealand, Chorus was able to reduce the cost per premises from A$4,753 in 2014 to A$2,598 in 2019. In Australia, the 2013 strategic review claimed it would cost $4,777. Under the Coalition government, NBN Co has now taken on a mix of government and private debt worth more than $57bn, as costs for constructing and maintaining the older technology went up. NBN Co has abandoned much of the cable network and is replacing fibre-to-the-node with fibre-to-the-premises in up to 1.6m homes, as part of a $4.5bn upgrade plan to provide gigabit speeds unachievable on the legacy copper lines. Under this upgrade, NBN Co is estimating the cost for replacing copper lines with fibre will be $1,500 per premises at most. The government has continued to justify overhauling the NBN rollout by referring to the strategic review. Fletcher told the National Press Club in September 2020 the government based its plan on the review and “the plan worked”."
"It’s been an eventful month for Elon Musk. The world’s richest man and founder of Tesla and SpaceX was, controversially, named Time’s person of the year; became embroiled in a Twitter spat over his taxes with a politician he branded “Senator Karen” and got a bizarre new haircut after splitting with his girlfriend, the pop singer Grimes. Next month, however, or perhaps a few weeks beyond if the attendant gremlins of spaceflight choose to play with the launch schedule, could come an achievement to surpass anything Musk has done before. The first orbital test launch of the largest and most powerful rocket ship ever to leave Earth – SpaceX’s towering Starship, from its Starbase headquarters in Texas – is seen by many as a pathway back to the moon for the first time in half a century and maybe the first vehicle to eventually land humans on Mars. The project that began life in Musk’s overactive mind more than a decade ago is every bit as ambitious as his pronouncement this week that: “I’ll be surprised if we’re not landing on Mars within five years.” Starship will be the first spacecraft in which all components are fully reusable, reducing significantly the traditionally astronomic costs of space travel. It has an unprecedented in-flight refueling capacity, allowing for more frequent and efficient operations. As the visionary behind the return to human spaceflight from US soil last year for the first time since the retirement of Nasa’s shuttle fleet in 2011, Musk, 50, is confident that his 395ft (120m) spacecraft, a full 32ft taller than the Apollo-era Saturn V, can deliver. Time magazine, in honoring the billionaire entrepreneur, appeared to acknowledge that humankind’s greatest achievements come from unorthodox minds. Musk, it said, is “a madcap hybrid of Thomas Edison, PT Barnum, Andrew Carnegie and Watchmen’s Doctor Manhattan, the brooding, blue-skinned man-god who invents electric cars and moves to Mars.” Sean O’Keefe, a former head of Nasa, said Musk had repeatedly challenged the traditional rules of spaceflight with great success. “One of the things that [he] has artfully figured out how to do is, whenever there has been any doubt about his ability to accomplish something, in some period of time thereafter, he has focused his attention, expertise and talent to go out and demonstrate that you can do it,” O’Keefe, professor of strategic management and leadership at Syracuse University, told the Guardian. “And that’s what this is. It is going to be interesting to see where this goes. [Starship] provides options, very significant options. “To look at, for example, the lunar surface as being not only reachable by multiple means but also by commercial sources that can do the regular resupply and so forth, will be extremely beneficial.” Starship will be propelled into orbit by a first-stage booster rocket called Super Heavy, to which SpaceX attached 29 of its Raptor engines before sending the entire craft to the launchpad at its Starbase launchpad this week. With about 16m pounds of thrust, and a capacity to lift up to 165 tons from the Earth’s surface, Starship is almost twice as powerful as the Saturn V rockets that sent 12 astronauts to the moon between 1969 and 1972. “You can really take advantage of the Starship architecture and get to the outer solar system in ways we haven’t thought about before,” Jennifer Heldmann, a planetary scientist at Nasa’s Ames research center in California, told Arstechnica. “It could provide a revolutionary new way of exploring these worlds.” Other innovative and speculative uses have been proposed for the new spacecraft, including asteroid-busting missions to protect Earth. Musk, though, has made no secret of his ambitions to reach the moon and one day colonize Mars to make humans a multi-planetary species. “The next really big thing is to build a self-sustaining city on Mars and bring the animals and creatures of Earth there,” he told Time. “Sort of like a futuristic Noah’s ark. We’ll bring more than two, though, it’s a little weird if there’s only two.” First, however, astronauts must return to the moon and Starship is only one of two spacecraft in production with the capability to land astronauts back there. Nasa’s own space launch system (SLS), part of the Artemis program, has suffered budget overruns and delays in development, pushing back its first crewed landing until at least 2025. SpaceX also has a hand in Artemis, having won the $2.9bn Nasa contract to build its lunar lander and sparking a lawsuit with rival Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin company that was settled in Musk’s favor last month. No firm date has been set in January for Starship’s orbital test launch, which follows a series of increasingly successful suborbital flights from Texas over the last two years. If successful, Musk has said up to a dozen further flights could follow in 2022, with Starship’s first lunar voyage – a space tourism venture funded by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa – set for 2023. O’Keefe, meanwhile, remains cautious about Starship’s deeper-space capabilities for humans, despite its size and innovation, given that it relies on the same chemical propulsion systems used in spaceflight “since Yuri Gagarin took the first trip and Alan Shepard was right behind him” in 1961. “Mars is 65m miles away,” he said. “‘Cutting’ the distance can only be achieved if you add space propulsion and right now we have none of that. We have no means to achieve it. No one on this rock knows how to do that. “The second thing we don’t have is the means to provide shielding sufficient to preserve human life. As it stands, the radioactivity is so extraordinary you wouldn’t make it, much less get back. Those are the two fundamental limitations I see to anyone being able to achieve anything much beyond the lunar objective at this stage.”"
"Twitter might actually get its act together Twitter has an unfortunate reputation as the punchbag of social media. It has failed to deliver the huge returns of bigger rivals such as Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram, it hasn’t been the cool new network for more than a decade and even its own most dedicated users love to drag it to oblivion. Investors have been similarly wary of the 300m-strong social network – it has lagged behind rivals in terms of features, revenue per user and for monetisation tools. Lots of people rely on Twitter to make at least part of their income, but tend to monetise it off the network, with no cut for Twitter. That might be starting to change. Twitter is trialling a “super follow” feature for people to support users they particularly like on the site, has bought the newsletter platform Revue and is integrating that with Twitter and has also bought up some other monetisation tools. With the departure of its part-time chief executive and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter might be worth a second look in 2022. NFTs will remain hyped to oblivion, some people will lose their shirts If you managed to avoid any mention of NFTs – short for non-fungible tokens – online in 2021, you spend your time in far less nerdy corners of the internet than we do. Non-fungible essentially means that one token isn’t identical to the next one. So for a cryptocurrency, one bitcoin is no different from another bitcoin. For an NFT, each token is unique. That means NFTs have become popular as a way to record blockchain “ownership” of a particular piece of digital art or memorabilia. These have included clips of NBA scoring shots, gorilla avatars and generative art. Advocates say the ability to own digital art enables people to make ongoing creative work from the NFT they own, perhaps using it as the art for their company logo, adding it to existing intellectual property or even making a Gorillaz-style NFT avatar band. Sceptics here note that all of this was and is possible without any use of NFTs at all: it is what intellectual property rights already exist to enable, after all. In practice, owning an NFT only proves you own the NFT – an entry on a blockchain somewhere saying you “own” whatever it links to. That may or may not be true legally, depending on how scrupulous the seller was. If people are buying NFTs and driving up the price because they truly value the artworks on offer, then the gold rush could prove sustainable. If people are buying them solely because they think someone else will buy one for more, lots of people will lose big. One special thing to watch out for, for buyers and sellers alike, is platform fees. These can amount to hundreds of dollars – do remember the house always wins. Uber, Deliveroo and the gig economy will struggle to make money The delivery economy – and transport economy – is as big as it ever was, with home delivery of restaurant food and groceries still on the high it reached during the pandemic and demand for Uber-style transport up 20% to 40% on pre-pandemic levels. The problem is that it doesn’t seem to be any more profitable for the companies offering the service than it was beforehand. Uber upped its prices by 10% in London, but is still struggling to recruit drivers and in the UK it is 20,000 drivers short of what it would need to meet demand. Alongside that, even though it is showing a tiny “adjusted” paper profit, it is still burning through hundreds of millions in cash. The companies have new competition for labour too, in the form of a flurry of 10-minute grocery delivery startups, including Getir, Weezy and several more. Each of these is offering hefty discounts and cheap delivery to try to secure more customers than their rivals and so will be burning through cash at an alarming rate. Expect several of these to fail or to merge before 2022 is out. Jack Dorsey will start a blockchain company. Peter Thiel might invest Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had been fairly obviously bored with his creation for some time, not least because his other company – the payments processor Square – has a valuation several times higher. If the subtle clues of Dorsey’s rare tweets largely being pro-blockchain hype and the fact of him owning a payments company weren’t enough, in the last weeks of 2021 Dorsey renamed the company Block. So, expect Jack Dorsey to launch a new blockchain-related subsidiary quite early in 2022 and don’t be surprised if Silicon Valley enfant terrible Peter Thiel invests – Thiel co-founded PayPal with the aim of breaking fiat currency and government control of money, so the appeal of blockchain as it hits maturity cannot be lost on him. DAOs will be the new Spacs This time last year, Spacs – short for special purpose acquisition companies – were the talk of the town. Spacs were a trick to help get your company publicly listed without the drawn-out, costly and risky process of an initial public offering (IPO). A company would be created, raise money and then look for a startup to merge with, skipping lots of regulatory steps. People feared it would undermine safeguards designed to protect regular investors. From now, though, Spacs feel like they’ve had their moment. While several startups, including BuzzFeed, went public via Spac in 2021, most of them underperformed the market and many lost money outright, meaning startups are eyeing up IPOs once again. The hot abbreviation as we enter 2022 then is DAO – short for decentralised autonomous organisation. DAOs, which generally use their own cryptocurrency to create a one-coin, one-vote democracy, raise money and seek to use it for some agreed purpose. One recently tried but failed to buy a copy of the US constitution, leading to an almighty row over refunds when it failed. Advocates see DAOs as the forefront of a new, democratised internet. Sceptics see a waste of time and effort, only an illusion of decentralisation, and big risks to naive investors not sure of the risks involved, or of the steep transaction fees. It’s possible both groups are right. People will try to make VR happen again The danger once anyone in technology starts using the phrases “immersive” or “living your life online” is that it’s almost inevitably followed by someone trying to make you wear a headset – and there’s no reason to believe Facebook’s attempt to push us on to the metaverse wearing their Oculus headsets will be any different. Users have generally avoided virtual reality. Heavy headsets, motion sickness, the poor content and the utter nerdiness of VR put almost everyone off. But with the metaverse, an immersive internet that we are assured will work properly this time, being big tech’s new fixation, expect to see a new flurry of VR hype very soon. Indie games will continue to have a renaissance This year was another banner year for indie gaming, with even notable indie flop No Man’s Sky, which drew widespread criticism on launch, now being acclaimed after turning itself around. Find-and-murder-your-friends indie Among Us became a huge lockdown hit, while Garden Story, Sable, Valheim and more broke through. Expect to see a similar slew of strong titles as the sector enjoys its renaissance in 2022. The podcast bubble won’t pop It’s safe to go back into your podcast app again. All those homemade lockdown podcasts launched by everyone’s boyfriend have deservedly withered on the vine and the state of podcast output is better than ever. Major professional broadcasters and production houses are making high-budget series, there is still a bustling indie scene and podcasting has found a voice beyond “two men in a shed”. The output is more diverse in terms of content and who’s behind the mic than with old media, and the monetisation is now working. Podcasts are a success story and we should take the win. …but the newsletter bubble might On the face of it, newsletters are enjoying a similar triumph, but here there are clouds on the horizon. Most of the top-table Substacks aren’t successful because they’re a counter to the culture wars, they’re successful because they fuel it. Substack hasn’t proved an escape from Twitter for authors, it has become an incentive to have Twitter beef and drive more subscriptions. A bigger problem is the price. If you subscribe to one newsletter, £4.99 a month or so seems reasonable. At four or five, you’re paying three or four times more for newsletters than you would for the New York Times. People are trimming their subs and wondering aloud whether there could be, say, a merged subscription at a lower price for numerous letters. Perhaps we could call it… a magazine? Ports are the new ports Finally, in the greatest U-turn since whatever Boris Johnson reversed himself on last week, Apple has done something it hasn’t in decades: it has added ports back on to its new MacBook Pro. After trimming them all the way down to simply two USB-C ports and a headphone jack, the new Pros have an HDMI port and even an SD card reader. We really are back to the future."
"The US chipmaker Intel has apologised for telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang, a province that human rights groups and governments including the US allege uses forced labour, after facing a backlash across China. Intel, which derives more than a quarter of its $80bn (£60bn) in annual revenues from the Chinese market, apologised to the people of China and its local partners on Thursday for telling suppliers to avoid the region in accordance with restrictions imposed by “multiple governments”. “We apologise for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,” Intel said in a post on the social media site WeChat, hours after its annual letter to suppliers was made public, prompting fury across China. “To clarify, the paragraph about Xinjiang in the letter is only for expressing the original intention of compliance and legality, not its intention or position.” The US and Amnesty International have accused China of widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang against the province’s majority Muslim Uyghur population, including forced labour, mass internment and torture, which Beijing denies. Earlier this month, Intel published its annual letter to suppliers saying that it had been “required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services” from Xinjiang. The letter, which is available in English and Chinese, went viral on Chinese social media this week. The Global Times, a Beijing-backed nationalist tabloid, accused Intel of biting “the hand that feeds it” and said the move was “absurd”. “What we need to do is to make it increasingly expensive for companies to offend China so their losses outweigh their gains,” the newspaper said in an editorial. The Chinese pop starWang Junkai posted on his official Weibo microblog that he would no longer serve as an Intel brand ambassador, adding that “national interests exceed everything”. Multinational companies have come under pressure as they aim to comply with Xinjiang-related trade sanctions while continuing to operate in China, one of their biggest markets. Brands including Nike and H&amp;M have come under pressure in China for voicing concerns about the treatment of Uyghurs, or trying to eliminate Xinjiang from their supply chains. Earlier this month, the US senate passed a new law barring imports from China’s north-western region unless businesses can prove they were produced without forced labour. The US has also announced a diplomatic boycott of Beijing’s Winter Olympic Games next year in protest against the alleged abuses. The Global Times said in its editorial that multinationals “should be able to endure, properly handle and balance pressure from all parties”."
"AirPods are bad, people. I’ve said it for years. In 2016, when Apple first debuted the overpriced accessories, I wrote that wireless headphones were like tampons without strings – missing the crucial feature that helps you find them when you need to. As the years have gone by, I’ve clung steadfastly to my wired headphone sets. (I say headphone sets, plural, because I need two pairs, one to plug into the headphone jack in my laptop and one to plug into the non-headphone jack in my iPhone. I frequently think that the people I can’t hear on Zoom calls are on mute when I actually just have the wrong pair of earbuds in my ears. I don’t care; I won’t change.) Now, all the smartest tech and security people are saying it too: wired headphones are simply better than wireless headphones. This moment of appreciation for the humble wired earbud (I still prefer the Apple version, which at $19 a pop come in at just over 10% of the cost of the third generation AirPods) comes courtesy of a peculiarly nasty dispatch from Politico about Kamala Harris’s preference for wired headphones over wireless ones. “Kamala Harris is Bluetooth-phobic,” read the headline of the piece, which went on to report that Harris uses wired headphones with her mobile phone because she “felt” and “believes” that Bluetooth headphones are a security threat. The piece cites an unnamed source who describes her aversion as “a bit paranoid” and questions whether “someone who travels with the nuclear football” should risk “spending time untangling her headphone wires”. But it fails to cite a cybersecurity expert, who could have told its authors that Bluetooth’s security vulnerability is not so much a “feeling” as a “reality” and that “someone who travels with the nuclear football” has a slightly more complicated threat model than the average iPhone user. (None of the three reporters bylined on the piece responded to my query about whether they had consulted any security researchers.) Bluetooth technology has been around since the 1990s, and while its security has improved over the years, it remains vulnerable to “man in the middle attacks”, cybersecurity researcher and writer Kim Crawley told me. That means that an attacker could intercept and decrypt the signal between the phone and the Bluetooth device, allowing them to listen in to whatever audio is being transmitted. “If Kamala Harris is using wired earbuds, then the communications going between her phone and her ears can’t be intercepted there,” said Crawley. “I would presume that Ms Harris is privy to a lot of top secret and classified information and that top secret and classified information could be going through her phone, so no I don’t think that’s overly paranoid.” Bluetooth signals are encrypted, but just like a lock on a door, encryption is a “barrier”, not a guarantee, Crawley said. Locks, after all, can be broken. Harris’s calls might still be vulnerable to interception at a different point (such as through the mobile phone network), but by eschewing wireless headphones, she is eliminating one possible “attack surface”, in cybersecurity lingo. Considering that a Bluetooth signal can extend 100m from the device and that an attacker might just look like a random person playing with her phone, using wired headphones is a pretty sensible precaution for a person with access to highly sensitive information and reason to believe they might be the target of attacks. This doesn’t mean that regular people have to abandon their AirPods, Crawley said. While some “high security computing environments” bar the use of any Bluetooth devices, including keyboards or computer mice, cybersecurity decisions should generally be tailored to your individual needs and vulnerabilities. “If there’s a man-in-the-middle attack and the only result is the cyber-attacker knows we like listening to the Spice Girls, that’s not a big problem,” Crawley said. My own aversion to AirPods is not the result of any high level threat modelling exercise (though the ever present anxiety of losing two exorbitantly expensive items does represent a threat to my sense of security). I just have a healthy skepticism of new products described as revolutionary by raging capitalists (something that served me well during my six years as a tech reporter) and a Boomerish aversion to many things new. I’ve managed to maintain this stance for long enough that wired headphones have achieved a certain level of retro cool, according to the Wall Street Journal, which last month reported on the rash of “fashionable young celebrities” who have been spotted “strutting around town with blatantly corded headphones”. This has provided me with what may just be the purest joy a single and childless 38-year-old woman can hope for in this life: the joy of being proven right. • This article was amended on 8 December 2021. An earlier version described Bluetooth technology as “having been around since the late 1980s”, rather than the 1990s."
"Facebook is testing a feature allowing users to control how much content they view from friends, groups and public figures, amid accusations that the social media platform is not doing enough to curb inflammatory posts. Users will be able to reduce or increase the amount of content that they see from specific categories on their news feed, a customised scroll of content from friends, pages and groups that is a central plank of users’ experience of the platform. Facebook’s menu for managing the contents of users’ news feed will offer options to control the amount of content from friends and family, groups, and pages and public figures. People in the test can keep the amount of posts in their feed under those categories at “normal”, or have them reduced or increased. Users will also be able to do the same with topics. “This is part of our ongoing work to give people more control over [their]news feed, so they see more of what they want and less of what they don’t,” said Facebook’s owner, Meta, in a statement. Facebook’s news feed, and the algorithms that control it, is a regular source of controversy and attempts at adjustment by its owner. Documents released in recent months by a whistleblower, Frances Haugen, showed that a change to Facebook’s news feed algorithm in 2018, to promote reshared posts had the effect of pushing toxic and violent content as well as misinformation. Haugen has also accused Meta of not doing enough to curb harmful content in general, with some of the documents she has released pointing to Facebook’s struggles to contain misinformation before the 6 January riots in Washington. Meta has denied that Facebook pushes divisive content. Speaking at the annual Web Summit this month, Meta’s vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said Facebook’s content was largely “babies, barbecues and barmitzvahs” and that promoting toxic content went against the platform’s commercial self-interest. As well as announcing the content test, Meta said it was launching an experiment allowing some advertisers on Facebook to avoid displaying their adverts to users who have recently engaged with posts related to news and politics, social issues, and crime and tragedy. “When an advertiser selects one or more topics, their ad will not be delivered to people recently engaging with those topics in their news feed,” said Meta."
"Elon Musk’s chaotic management of the social media platform Twitter is hurting his brand, and investors should stay away from stock in his electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, former hedge fund manager Danny Moses of The Big Short fame said this week. Moses’s remarks late Thursday came in an interview with CNBC on the same day that Twitter appeared to have at least temporarily suspended a number of prominent journalists who had reported on Musk and the operations of the platform which he acquired in October for $44bn. Musk sought to justify the actions late in the day by saying that Twitter had forbidden sharing details on his real-time location, and he accused journalists who he alleged had shared his whereabouts of publishing “assassination coordinates”. But the accounts’ suspension prompted outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, with critics asserting that Musk was curbing press freedoms despite presenting himself as an advocate of free speech. Moses on Thursday said he had bet against the performance of Tesla’s stock, saying its price is rooted in Musk’s personal brand, which has been “hit a little bit”. “It’s still a $500bn company, and I don’t think the fundamentals justify that valuation,” the founder of the investment fund Moses Ventures said. “He’s running three … very large companies at this point, so there’s a lot obviously that he has to deal with. “We’re getting frustrated here, because his attention span is being compromised.” Moses warned Tesla could be in for a rough 2023, when some predict a national recession is possible, among other economic pressure. Tesla’s stock is down 60% from what it was in January after anemic earnings and populist disapproval of Musk, who fired thousands of Twitter employees after taking over the platform and then told those who kept their jobs to be ready to labor for “long hours at high intensity”. Musk – who additionally runs SpaceX – has also worried investors by recently selling off $3.6bn worth of Tesla shares. That divestment came as he lost the world’s richest man title to Louis Vuitton and Dom Perignon magnate Bernard Arnault of France, bringing sales of Musk’s stock in his electric carmaker to more than $20bn. It has all prompted Tesla’s third largest shareholder, Indonesian billionaire KoGuan Leo, to call on Musk to step down as the carmaker’s chief executive officer, according to Observer.com. The contempt many in the public hold for Musk became clear last week, when a crowd in San Francisco booed him lustily after he was introduced on stage at a show hosted by comedian Dave Chappelle. Moses is perhaps best known as the former head trader at FrontPoint Partners, which was run by Steve Eisman, who was portrayed by the actor Steve Carell in the movie The Big Short. Both the movie and the Michael Lewis book of the same name chronicled how some investors like Moses foresaw the crash of the mid-2000s housing bubble and capitalized on it. In addition to founding his investment fund, Moses has been an adviser of the cannabis investment group Merida Capital Partners in New York."
"The crisis at Twitter reached new heights after hundreds of employees were reported to have rejected Elon Musk’s ultimatum to keep working for the business, threatening its ability to keep operating. As the company temporarily closed its offices to staff on Friday, Twitter users began saying their goodbyes and linking to accounts on other platforms. #RIPTwitter, #TwitterDown, Mastodon and Myspace were all trending on the platform after the deadline passed on Musk’s ultimatum for the remaining workforce to sign up for “long hours at high intensity” by Thursday, or leave. It has been estimated that hundreds of the remaining staff, already cut from 7,500 to around 3,750 in the wake of Musk’s takeover of Twitter last month, opted to go. The departures include many engineers responsible for fixing bugs and preventing service outages, raising questions about the stability of the platform amid the loss of employees and prompting hurried debates among managers over who should be asked to return, current and former employees said. In an early sign that the number of those declining to sign was greater than anticipated, Musk eased off a return-to-office mandate he had issued a week ago, telling employees on Thursday they would be allowed to work remotely if their managers asserted they were making “an excellent contribution”. Twitter later announced via email that it would close “our office buildings” and disable employee badge access until Monday, the New York Times reported. Online, users were speculating that the site could go down in a matter of hours or days. In July Twitter’s former head of security, Peiter Zatko, filed a whistleblower complaint warning of poor infrastructure standards at Twitter even before Musk’s takeover, alleging that more than 50% of Twitters 500,000 data centre servers are running software that is out of date or have other known security problems. On Thursday evening, the version of the Twitter app used by employees began slowing down, according to one source familiar with the matter, who estimated that the public version of Twitter was at risk of breaking during the night. Website DownDetector reported a significant uptick in user reports of issues on the site. “If it does break, there is no one left to fix things in many areas,” the person said, who declined to be named for fear of retribution. One information security expert warned that the site could now be vulnerable to hacks if overnight departures have depleted some engineering functions severely. “Twitter, like any big website, is the target of lots of unsophisticated attackers and a few sophisticated ones,” said Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London. “Many security measures are preventative but some rely on skilled personnel monitoring for unusual behaviour, investigating these cases, and taking the appropriate steps to keep the attackers away from critical systems. Are these people still in their jobs?” A US-based Twitter engineer who resigned on Thursday said he would have been “on-call constantly” had he stayed, dealing with complex systems he had no experience in because of the scale of cuts among engineering colleagues. Peter Clowes, a senior software engineer at Twitter, tweeted: “If I stayed I would have been on-call constantly with little support for an indeterminate amount of time on several additional complex systems I had no experience in.” The news prompted an outpouring of concern among users on the platform, and prompted many users to link to their accounts on Instagram or Mastodon as an alternative. US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted she could be found on Instagram or on email. She followed up with a tweet saying those employees who built the company deserved better. “Shout out to all the workers at Twitter. You all built a vital place for connection and deserved so much better,” she said. Official government accounts also began providing means of being found elsewhere. On Friday Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, described Twitter’s behaviour as “unacceptable” and said that “employees of any company must be treated with respect and dignity.” Prior to Musk’s takeover, Twitter employed 500 people in Ireland. Musk was tweeting through the drama. On Friday he posted memes mocking the expected demise of the platform and said Twitter usage was at an “all-time high” – something he blamed on media reporting about Twitter. Earlier, Musk was meeting some top employees to try to convince them to stay, said one current employee and a recently departed employee who was in touch with Twitter colleagues. In a private chat on Signal with about 50 Twitter staffers, almost 40 said they had decided to leave, according to the former employee. And in a private Slack group for Twitter’s current and former employees, about 360 people joined a new channel titled “voluntary-layoff”, said a person with knowledge of the Slack group. A separate poll on Blind asked staffers to estimate what percentage of people would leave Twitter based on their perception. More than half of respondents estimated at least 50% of employees would leave. Fortune Magazine reported that 75% of Twitter’s remaining 3,700 employees might have left on Thursday. While it is unclear how many employees have chosen to stay, the numbers highlight the reluctance of some staffers to remain at a company where Musk has hastened to fire half its employees including top management, and is ruthlessly changing the culture to emphasise long hours and an intense pace. Twitter, which has lost many of its communication team members, did not respond to a request for comment. Blue hearts and salute emojis flooded the site and its internal chatrooms on Thursday, the second time in two weeks as Twitter employees said their goodbyes. By 6pm EST, more than two dozen Twitter employees across the United States and Europe had announced their departures in public Twitter posts reviewed by Reuters, though each resignation could not be independently verified. Early on Wednesday, Musk had emailed Twitter employees, saying: “Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore.” The email asked staff to click “yes” if they wanted to stick around. Those who did not respond by 5pm eastern time on Thursday would be considered to have quit and given a severance package, the email said. As the deadline approached, employees scrambled to figure out what to do. One team within Twitter decided to take the leap together and leave the company, one employee who is leaving told Reuters. In an apparent jab at Musk’s call for employees to be “hardcore”, the Twitter profile bios of several departing engineers on Thursday described themselves as “softcore engineers” or “ex-hardcore engineers”. Reuters contributed to this report."
"What a difference a year makes. Last October, Facebook supremo Mark Zuckerberg could barely wait to show the world what he was up to. “Today, we’re going to talk about the metaverse,” he enthused in a slick video presentation. “I want to share what we imagine is possible.” Transitioning almost seamlessly from his real self into a computer-generated avatar, Zuckerberg guided us through his vision for the virtual-reality future: playing poker in space with your buddies; sharing cool stuff; having work meetings and birthday parties with people on the other side of the world; customising your avatar (the avatars had no legs, which was weird). Zuckerberg was so all-in on the metaverse, he even rechristened his company Meta. This month, we saw a more subdued Zuckerberg on display: “I wanna say upfront that I take full responsibility for this decision,” he told employees morosely. “This was ultimately my call and it was one of the hardest calls that I’ve had to make in the 18 years of running the company.” Meta was laying off 11,000 people – 13% of its workforce. Poor third-quarter results had seen Meta’s share price drop by 25%, wiping $80bn off the company’s value. Reality Labs, Meta’s metaverse division, had lost $3.7bn in the past three months, with worse expected to come. It wasn’t all bad news, though: Zuckerberg announced last month that Meta avatars would at last be getting legs. After decades of spectacular “move fast and break things” growth, Zuckerberg’s empire is now looking a little fragile. Meta’s share price has fallen by more than 70% this year. Moneyspinners Facebook and Instagram are losing market share and Gen Z users to fresher rivals like TikTok and Snapchat. Apple’s changes to data privacy last year also decimated revenues – its introduction of an “ask not to track” option on iPhones has effectively starved Facebook of the lucrative data it uses to target ads. Meanwhile, Meta has invested a staggering $100bn on metaverse research and development to date, $15bn in the past year alone – with apparently little to show for it. Zuckerberg’s newfound metaverse obsession could be seen as a preemptive virtual land grab for what is generally agreed to be the future of the internet. It could also represent an attempted second act, for both the 38-year-old and his somewhat tarnished Facebook brand. But the markets seem to be saying “count us out”, and according to reports, just 58% of Meta’s own employees said they understood the company’s metaverse vision. Comments on the latest lay-offs in an anonymous employee survey included, “the metaverse will be our slow death” and “Mark Zuckerberg will single-handedly kill a company with the metaverse”. If nothing else, Zuckerberg has popularised the term “metaverse”, even if he didn’t invent it, and definitions of what it means vary. Zuckerberg explained it as “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it”. Rather than our current 2D, screen-based internet, in other words, the metaverse will be a 3D virtual space, accessed by either a VR headset or AR (augmented reality) glasses, which superimpose a layer of digital information on top of the visible world. Matthew Ball, tech investor and author of The Metaverse: How It Will Revolutionise Everything, defines the metaverse as “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds”, with individual presence and continuity of data. He has to explain it less and less, he says: “A year ago, it was mostly ‘what is the metaverse?’ Questions now are a lot more practical: what will be here? When? For whom? How, and why?” The “why” is a particularly good question when it comes to Meta. “You’re going to be able to do almost anything you can imagine,” said Zuckerberg in his intro video last year. “Get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create …” At the time we were just coming out of the pandemic. Remote working, video calling and e-commerce had suddenly become the norm. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended,” Zuckerberg said in a recent staff email. “I did, too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.” Post-pandemic, it turned out people still preferred meeting face to face or on a video call to donning a clunky VR headset and dragging your legless avatar into a virtual meeting room. It has been a similar story on the leisure side. Meta’s Quest VR headsets are the market leader, but most buyers are not using them to flock to Meta’s principal app, Horizon Worlds – which the company describes as “a synchronous social network where creators can build engaging worlds”. Meta set a target of 500,000 Horizon Worlds users by the end of 2022; the current figure is nearer 200,000 – down from 300,000 in February, which suggests many first-time visitors are not returning. It has been criticised for programming bugs, instability, rudimentary graphics and a general sense of boredom. From my own visits to Horizon Worlds, the 3D motion and audio were fine but the graphics were basic, often garish and textureless: a good two decades behind today’s best video games. The feeling is of a sparsely attended trade fair. Many of Horizon Worlds’ activities felt more like demonstrations: in a perfunctory wild west town, you can shoot a virtual bottle in a virtual saloon with your virtual pistol (with unsatisfyingly lo-fi results) and ride a hobby horse (literally a virtual horse’s head on a broomstick). At the Marvel superheroes world, you can try on various costumes that enable you to fly or shoot lightning bolts, and that’s about it. There were few people in either the social “hangout” areas or the “games” section, and most of the strangers I encountered seemed to be American children. One had the avatar and voice of a 10-year-old girl. Not even the people making Horizon Worlds have embraced it. Memos leaked in October appeared to show the Meta vice-president, Vishal Shah, urging staff to use their own products more. “If we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?” Shah wrote. “Everyone in this organisation should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds. You can’t do that without using it. Get in there.” Meanwhile, direct competitors such as VRChat and Rec Room are thriving. “It’s pretty clear they are offering something that Meta doesn’t,” says veteran games designer Raph Koster, namely better avatars, a wider choices of games and, critically, bigger crowds (Rec Room has an estimated three million monthly users). “Next to those, Meta looks relatively sterile and empty. There’s just a lack of sufficient entertainment in there.” Horizon World’s numbers are dwarfed by those of online games (most of which are accessible with and without VR headsets). Fortnite attracts 250 million active players a month. Gaming platform Roblox has more 200 million visitors a month and Minecraft 170 million (two-thirds of whom are under 16 – the exact demographic that is turning away from Facebook and other social media). “Historically, we’ve seen that game worlds generally don’t have any trouble attracting an audience,” says Koster. This is not a revelation. “Bars with a jukebox or a pool table tend to do better than bars without anything. It doesn’t change because you digitise the experience.” Unlike Meta, the games industry began with the “why?” It was building complex, sophisticated, popular virtual worlds – proto-metaverses – long before the idea caught Zuckerberg’s eye. As such, it is well positioned for a slice of the metaverse pie. Epic Games, for example, whose Unreal game engine (think of it as the “brain” of the game; the software framework that builds the reality in real time) powers not only its bestselling Fortnite but hundreds of other games and applications, making it attractive to independent metaverse-builders. In April, Sony and Lego invested $2bn in Epic’s metaverse vision. In January, Microsoft moved to acquire another games giant, Activision Blizzard, makers of World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Candy Crush, for nearly $70bn (the deal is currently under antitrust review). Having sprung out of social networks like Facebook, Meta’s model is based on “an attention economy, not a fulfilment economy”, says Herman Narula, head of the British tech company Improbable. Social media prioritises keeping users passively engaged for as long as possible, whereas gaming seeks to provide fulfilling, active experiences. “There’s a difference between watching an experience and having an experience,” he says. “If you look at games like Fortnite and Minecraft … what matters is presence; how many things can you do? In Minecraft, you can move anything about it, you can modify the laws, you can be creative. So what matters is creating a highly creative environment, which allows the normal self-expression.” Improbable’s website claims “we are the metaverse technology company”. Among other things (it works with military as well as gaming companies), the company, which Narula co-founded in 2012, is working on connecting various metaverses together, and hosting large numbers of people in virtual worlds. Whereas most multiplayer online games, like Fortnite, never really put more than 100 people together on one server, Improbable has hosted events bringing together 30,000 people in the same virtual space. Unsurprisingly, Narula is optimistic about the metaverse. In his recent book Virtual Society, he writes: “Like the development of writing, or the advent of the computer age, the dawn of the metaverse will be a grand pivot point in the history of humanity.” The metaverse was valued at nearly $23bn last year and is expected to grow nearly 40% a year for the rest of the decade. As the Epic co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney put it last year: “The next three years are going to be critical for all of the metaverse-aspiring companies like Epic, Roblox, Microsoft, Facebook [Meta]. It’s kind of a race to get to a billion users. Whoever brings on a billion users first would be the presumed leader in setting the standards.” The building blocks of the metaverse are coming together, and Meta is working on many of them: hardware like VR and AR devices, data and network infrastructure, social platforms and interfaces, developer and creator ecosystems – all of which require skilled people (in Meta’s recent 11,000-person cull, Reality Labs was relatively unscathed). “We are creating a new category that requires significantly and abundantly more resources than it takes to create a single product or collection of products,” says a Meta spokesperson. “It’s misguided to categorise our long-term investment as a loss while we are within our initial phases of development.” So no more “move fast and break things”; now it’s more of a “move slowly and build things” vibe. From the outset, Zuckerberg said the metaverse would take five to 10 years to arrive, though some, such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, are saying it is here already. Matthew Ball agrees: “We have hundreds of millions interacting in 3D virtual worlds each day,” he says, pointing to the likes of Roblox and Minecraft. But it goes beyond gaming: “Johns Hopkins University hospital is now performing surgery with XR [as in “extended reality” – VR and AR] devices and game engines, while Vancouver airport runs a 3D simulation [a “digital twin” of the airport, incorporating real-time information which can be used for training, optimisation, future planning, simulation and testing] and similarly Tesla cars are building a live simulation of San Francisco using Unreal. The pieces are more mature than many give credit, but we’ve yet to develop the standards and systems to integrate them in the ways the internet is developed today.” It is unlikely that Meta, or any other big tech company, will “own” the metaverse, says Ball. “We often misrepresent the control of big tech,” he says, pointing out that the “Big Five” – Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft – together collect less than 10% of digital revenues, “although they exert disproportionate influence over the rest of the internet … It is likely that a similar outcome happens with the metaverse: a handful of vertically and horizontally integrated software and hardware giants amass the substantial share of users, data, revenue, devices, etc, and exert even greater influence. The metaverse is likely to grow big tech’s reach, not shrink it.” If Meta does succeed in controlling a substantial slice of the metaverse, though, there are further, deeper concerns. The charge sheet against social media in general, and Facebook/Meta in particular, is extensive: disseminating and amplifying online disinformation and hate speech, unseen and undisclosed political influence, its impact on mental health, the collection and misuse of personal data. “Whatever company owns the metaverse will have better information about crime, better surveillance, better everything than the government will,” says Koster. He points out how much of our lives is already online: our personal records, our résumés, our bank accounts, our friendships, our online movements and behaviours. The metaverse will enable access to even more layers of data: “A lot of the folks who work on the hardware for AR glasses, for example, are concerned about the fact that the glasses can read biometrics off your iris, and that tells them an enormous amount about your medical state, your emotions moment to moment. Virtual worlds are panopticons. The more we digitise the world, that’s the power we’re handing over to whoever runs that metaverse.” Meta is taking pains to assuage such fears. “The metaverse is a collective project,” says a spokesperson, “and how to responsibly manage the new types of data that companies may collect is exactly the kind of challenge that needs collaboration and discussion. It’s not up to any one company to set the rules on this.” All are in agreement that regulation is needed, but judging by how well the internet has been governed so far, the outlook is complicated – potentially liberating; potentially downright dystopian."
"The British government has blocked the takeover of the UK’s largest producer of semiconductors by a Chinese-owned manufacturer, citing “a risk to national security”. The business department’s decision on Wednesday comes more than a year after semiconductor company Nexperia first announced that it had taken control of Newport Wafer Fab in south Wales in July 2021, in a £63m deal. The company, now known as Nexperia Newport, makes chips that are used for power management in electronic devices. Nexperia is based in the Netherlands, but is owned by China’s Wingtech. In its notice of final order, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the secretary of state considers the risk to national security relates to “technology and knowhow that could result from a potential reintroduction of compound semiconductor activities at the Newport site, and the potential for those activities to undermine UK capabilities”. BEIS also noted: “The location of the site could facilitate access to technological expertise and knowhow in the south Wales Cluster (“the Cluster”), and the links between the site and the Cluster may prevent the Cluster being engaged in future projects relevant to national security.” The decision will raise questions over the future of the jobs of 550 workers at the Newport site as well as those of the 1,000 people at a separate Nexperia facility in Stockport. Nexperia’s UK boss, Toni Versluijs, said the company was “genuinely shocked”. “The decision is wrong, and we will appeal to overturn this divestment order to protect the over 500 jobs at Newport,” he said. “This decision sends a clear signal that the UK is closed for business. The UK is not levelling up, but levelling down communities like south Wales.” Versluijs said the decision was legally wrong and disproportionate given remedies proposed by the company for government concerns, such as a pledge not to create more sophisticated compound semiconductors. Nexperia Newport is not large by global chipmaking standards, with revenues of £31m in its last reported financial year, compared with £36bn for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the giant of the industry producing cutting-edge chips. However, the takeover sparked concerns for the future of the UK’s chip industry, some of whose products are used in defence, and its ownership by a company that could be influenced by a geopolitical rival. Countries around the world have sought to bolster their domestic semiconductor industries, amid concerns over the reliance on manufacturers in Taiwan, which is claimed by China as its territory, and South Korea. The US plans to invest $52bn (£44bn) in its chips industry, while the EU has said it will invest €43bn (£38bn). Kwasi Kwarteng, who was business secretary at the time before a chaotic 38-day stint as chancellor, ordered an investigation into the Nexperia takeover in May under the new National Security and Investment Act, which was introduced at the start of the year. The government delayed the final decision at the start of July, giving it until midnight on Wednesday. Tom Tugendhat, a vocal critic of China’s government who now serves as the UK’s security minister under Rishi Sunak, had been among the politicians pushing for the takeover to be reviewed on security grounds. The review prompted two British chipmaking executives to express interest in buying the company if Nexperia’s purchase were blocked. Ron Black, former chief executive of Imagination Technologies, led a consortium which said it had received promises of £300m in backing, while Newport Wafer Fab’s former owner, Drew Nelson, was also working on a potential private equity-backed deal, the Financial Times reported in September. Versluijs in July told MPs the company had no plans to move operations abroad."
"Tesla shares fell on Tuesday to their lowest in more than two years, marking the company’s worst day in eight months, as Elon Musk’s electric carmaker confronts a rocky financial period. The company’s stock has lost more than half its value since the start of October. Investors worry that Twitter is taking much of Musk’s time, now that he is the social network’s owner and CEO. His tenure as head of the platform has been marked by chaos as he implements – and often reverses – a host of new policies. Musk recently said he would find a new CEO to replace him after most polled Twitter users voted for him to step down. Experts say his erratic behavior has undermined confidence in Tesla, with shares down 73% from November 2021. Tuesday’s loss, which saw Tesla shares drop 11.4%, also followed a Reuters report that the company was planning to run a reduced production schedule in January at its Shanghai plant. That news sparked worries of a drop in demand in the world’s biggest car market, amid a rising number of Covid-19 infections in China. “There’s no question there are demand fears,” Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes said, citing a delivery forecast cut from Chinese rival Nio in the key market. Hayes also added that Tesla’s stock was facing a “perfect storm” of high interest rates, tax-loss selling and share sales by some funds that hold a significant amount of Tesla stock. Tax-loss selling is when an investor sells an asset at a capital loss to lower or eliminate the capital gain realized by other investments for income tax purposes. Meanwhile, a Reuters analysis showed that prices of used Tesla cars were falling faster than those of other carmakers, weighing on demand for the company’s new vehicles rolling off the assembly line. Musk previously attributed Tesla’s recent struggles to rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, stating “people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop”. The billionaire himself has offloaded Tesla stock this year, selling nearly $4bn of his own shares in Tesla to finance the deal to buy Twitter, which he bought at $44bn. He said in mid-December he would not sell additional Tesla stock “for at least 18 to 24 months”. However, financial filings show he sold millions after making similar promises in April 2022. Analysts have raised the possibility of Musk being asked to step down as executive at Tesla over his actions at Twitter, as he is already facing a lawsuit over his alleged failure to focus on Tesla due to outside ventures."
"Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he will not step down as chief executive of the company until he can find a suitable replacement, citing the state of the company’s finances as a reason to delay his promised departure. “I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams,” Musk tweeted, before joining a Twitter livestream to discuss the company’s situation with a former intern. It was the first time Musk had mentioned leaving the role as chief of the social media platform since Twitter users voted decisively in a poll for him to step down, which the billionaire launched on Sunday evening. But the acknowledgement was far from a firm commitment to keep to his promise. In the broadcast, Musk chatted with audience members about his experience at the company, and emphasised the necessity of cutting costs. Under his watch, Twitter is down to “a little over 2,000 people”, he said, having been facing a “negative cash flow situation of $3bn [£2.48bn] a year” until he arrived, describing the situation as “net dead”. “That’s why I spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy,” he said, to ensure that Twitter would be “roughly cash flow breakeven” by 2023. Even now, running the company is as though “you’re in a plane heading to the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don’t work”. Some of the company’s costs, he acknowledged, were a result of his own acquisition, which saddled the company with $12.5bn of debt that it has to pay out of its revenues. But “with the changes we are making here on massively reducing the burn rate, and building subscriber revenue, I now think that Twitter will, in fact, be OK next year.” This week’s Twitter poll, sent in the wake of watching the World Cup final in Doha with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, is not the first time Musk has said he will not run the company in the long term. In November, the second-richest person in the world told a court in Delaware he would reduce his time at Twitter and eventually find someone to run it in his place. Calls on Wall Street for Musk to step down had been growing for weeks, and recently Tesla investors have questioned whether his focus on the social media platform is distracting him from properly steering the electric vehicle business. Musk admitted in the court hearing that he had too much on his plate. He said on Sunday, though, that there was no successor and “no one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive”. Prior to Tuesday’s tweet, Musk’s only response to the poll was to tweet claims that the results had been skewed by fake accounts. He also responded to a tweet suggesting only users who were paying $8 or $11 (for iOS subscribers) for a Twitter Blue subscription should be able to vote in the polls by saying Twitter would “make that change.” The poll calling for him to stand down followed a series of highly criticised decisions by Twitter’s new owner. He first banned an account that tracked the location of his private jet, and followed it up with a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. After users responded by announcing plans to leave to other platforms, Musk implemented a new policy banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram and Facebook. The change was made during the Fifa World Cup final in Qatar, where Musk was spotted in attendance with Kushner. By the end of the day, the policy had been abandoned, with Musk saying all major policy changes in the future would be decided by a vote. Reuters contributed to this report."
"People who use social media posts to encourage self-harm face criminal prosecution under government changes to the revived online safety bill. Culture secretary Michelle Donelan will update the bill to criminalise encouraging self-harm when the legislation returns to parliament next month. The move follows the inquest this year into the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing online material related to self-harm, suicide and depression. In a groundbreaking verdict, the coroner ruled that the “negative effects of online content” contributed to Molly’s death. “I am determined that the abhorrent trolls encouraging the young and vulnerable to self-harm are brought to justice,” said Donelan. “So I am strengthening our online safety laws to make sure these vile acts are stamped out and the perpetrators face jail.” The proposed amendment to the bill, which returns to the House of Commons on 5 December, also requires social media companies to prevent such content appearing online or else face the threat of substantial fines. The bill imposes a duty of care on tech platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to prevent illegal content – which will now include material encouraging self-harm – being exposed to users. The communications regulator Ofcom will have the power to levy fines of up to 10% of a company’s revenues. Donelan said: “Social media firms can no longer remain silent bystanders. They’ll face fines for allowing this abusive and destructive behaviour to continue on their platforms under our laws.” The progress of the online safety bill has been paused twice since it was introduced to parliament in 2021, amid Conservative backbench concerns about its impact on free speech. In July Kemi Badenoch, then a Tory leadership contender, said the bill was in “no fit state” to become law and, in an apparent reference to the bill’s provisions on content which is “legal but harmful”, that “we should not be legislating for hurt feelings”. The then culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, hit back, asking if encouraging others to take their own life should be defined as “hurt feelings”. Donelan indicated that criticisms from some parliamentary colleagues will be addressed by removing provisions on legal but harmful material for adults. She said in September that the part of the bill addressing content that causes harm but falls below the threshold of criminality is “the bit we will be changing” when the legislation comes back. A spokesperson for the Molly Rose Foundation, a charity set up by Molly Russell’s family, said the proposal to criminalise encouraging self-harm “appears a significant move”, but more “harmful but legal” content should be tackled in the bill. “From the evidence submitted to Molly Russell’s inquest in September, the ‘harmful but legal’ content probably did the most damage to Molly’s mental health,” said the spokesperson. Referring to one of the posts seen by Molly and cited in the inquest, they added: “Would this new offence prevent posts such as: ‘Who would love a suicidal girl?’ or would these continue to be spread by the social media tech platforms? It’s therefore important that other ‘harmful but legal’ content, of the type we know was harmful to Molly, is also within scope of the bill.” The inquest has given renewed impetus to reintroducing the bill after a coroner’s court heard evidence that the teenager had consumed vast amounts of harmful online material before she died. Of 16,300 pieces of content that Molly interacted with on Instagram in the six months before she died, 2,100 were related to suicide, self-harm and depression. It also emerged that Pinterest, the image-sharing platform, had sent her content recommendation emails with titles such as “10 depression pins you might like”. Encouragement of suicide is already illegal, and the bill will strengthen provisions to protect children from harmful content when it returns. One change to the bill has already been confirmed with the announcement last week of new offences covering the taking or sharing of intimate images of a person. It will criminalise the sharing of pornographic “deepfakes” – images or videos manipulated to resemble a person – and the taking of “downblousing” images where photos are taken down a person’s top. Installing equipment in order to take an illicit image of an individual will also be criminalised."
"Elon Musk has given Twitter’s remaining staff a Thursday deadline to commit to working “long hours at high intensity” and being “extremely hardcore” or else leave with three months’ severance pay. In an email to the social media platform’s employees, seen by the Guardian, its new owner said building the next iteration of Twitter would require “exceptional performance”. “Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore. This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,” Musk wrote. The message asked staff to click on a link if they want to be “part of the new Twitter” by 5pm New York time (10pm GMT) on Thursday. Anyone who has not affirmed their commitment by that deadline, Musk said, would receive three months of severance pay. “Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful,” Musk added in the email, which was first reported by the Washington Post. Musk added that Twitter would be “much more engineering-driven” under his ownership and that “those writing great code will constitute the majority of our team”. The ultimatum follows a severe jobs bloodbath at Twitter at the beginning of November in which Musk laid off 50% of the 7,500-strong workforce within days of taking over the company. Musk also reportedly laid off more than 4,000 contractors, including members of Twitter’s moderation teams, over the weekend. Carl Tobias, a law professor at university of Richmond, said Musk could face challenges over the ultimatum if he follows it through by firing non-compliant staff. “The federal Warn (Worker Adjustment &amp; Retraining Act) and the California analog require employers of 500 workers or more to give employees written notice within 60 days of mass layoffs. If employers do not do so, employees may sue, and some Twitter employees did do that in the recent round of layoffs. However, the relief is 60 days of back pay and Musk is granting 90 days in his latest tweet.” There has also been an executive exodus at the company, which began with the firing of the then-chief executive, Parag Agrawal, after the takeover was completed, and was followed this month by the resignation of key members of the remaining senior management team including the head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth. Staff members who have criticised Musk over Twitter have also been let go, including Eric Frohnhoefer, a Twitter engineer who told Musk that a tweet about the platform had been incorrect. Musk subsequently tweeted: “he’s been fired”. That post was later deleted, although Frohnhoefer, who has been approached for comment, has since tweeted a photo of a locked computer screen and discussed his departure with the tech newsletter Platformer. Musk also announced late on Tuesday that the launch of a new verification scheme at Twitter would be delayed until 29 November. Attempts to revamp user identification have triggered a slew of fake accounts that led to the apparent suspension of the service last Friday and have consolidated an advertiser boycott that was already under way. Musk wrote on Twitter that he was “punting relaunch of Blue Verified to November 29th to make sure that it is rock solid”. Twitter had launched its premium service, Twitter Blue, with an $8 monthly price tag that included a blue tick – which flags a verified, trustworthy account – on 9 November. However, the move led to a number of mischievous users jumping on the opportunity to launch fake accounts. The pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co was forced to apologise after an impostor account, carrying a blue tick, tweeted that insulin was free. Nintendo, Lockheed Martin and Musk’s own Tesla and SpaceX were also impersonated, as well as the accounts of various professional sports figures."
"Amid ongoing fallout from Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, speculation of the platform’s imminent collapse is swirling – leaving users wondering what parts of their online selves they’ll get to keep. After Musk laid off thousands of workers, many users have reported signs the platform is falling apart in real time – from glitching home pages to log-in failures – and researchers are desperately urging users to download their tweets in case Twitter implodes completely. “If there’s something you care about on Twitter, now’s the time to become like a temporary expert in digital archiving measures,” said Caroline Sinders, an artificial intelligence researcher and founder of human rights lab Convocation Research and Design. Digital archiving – the process of preserving online content for future use – has expanded steadily since the launch of the internet, but still exists in a patchwork, decentralized framework. There have been a number of efforts to salvage posts on Twitter throughout its 16 years of existence: the Library of Congress began archiving all tweets in 2007, but halted the process in 2017 due to the growing scale of the platform. It now saves Twitter content “on a selective basis”. Tweets from influential accounts are more likely to be saved. The National Archives and Records Administration preserves the content of all federal government Twitter accounts, according to a spokesman from the Library of Congress. Activists and media outlets have built their own tracking systems, with “Politiwoops” – a service from ProPublica that tracks deleted tweets from public officials – and PolitiTweet, which aims to “keep the powerful accountable” by monitoring and archiving tweets from celebrities, politicians and public figures. But what about the average Twitter user, whose posts have not been deemed of interest by anyone but those who know them? Many users have tweeted in recent days that they are seeking to archive tweets from loved ones who have passed away. “Is it possible to download someone else’s archive? My sister’s tweets are still posted from six years ago and I reread them when I miss her” one user wrote. “One of my closest friends passed away last year, when I’m having a bad day I still go and find him on Twitter and laugh at his sarcastic tweets,” another said. “It would be heartbreaking for his account to just disappear.” The Internet Archive, a non-profit founded in 1996, is the largest public web archive and offers publicly available tools to upload and save content online. It has archived more than 625bn web pages – including a number of tweets. But many platforms do not make saving content easy in the event of their collapse, and Twitter is no exception, said Jason Scott, a free-range archivist at the Internet Archive who has worked to archive parts of Twitter over the last 15 years. “This reveals a difficult problem on a cultural, engineering and cost level,” Scott said. “Most companies do not consider their own mortality in their code or engineering design.” The archive of Twitter may look quite different from the online version – many tools for downloading tweets do not save media included with them, or replies. It is difficult to scrape accounts for content over time, particularly those that are private. The sheer volume of posts on Twitter make it particularly difficult to archive. Since Twitter’s founder, Jack Dorsey, sent the first tweet in 2006, billions of posts have been created on the microblogging site – with an average of 6,000 tweets sent each second. Although Twitter’s current downward spiral has been shockingly abrupt, the internet landscape has always been precarious – with the average lifespan of a webpage less than three years. The graveyard of platforms past has grown steadily over the years, with the fall of Myspace, Friendster, AOL, Vine and others. “This is highlighting the ephemerality of social networks, and that even if we use them like public infrastructure at times, they are not,” Sinders said. “Musk could decide to pull the plug tomorrow, and companies can make executive decisions that affect all of us.” The abrupt threat to Twitter’s existence has raised questions about who decides which cultural artifacts to keep. If 16 years of content from the platform disappear overnight, what should survive? Trump’s tweets – however inane or inflammatory – will exist forever in public records. But the average user’s complaint about a long line for coffee in the morning or a silly picture of their pet may be lost forever. “Twitter contains multitudes of reflections of humanity in every direction,” Scott said. “And waking up to see everything’s been wrecked has placed us at a true crossroads. Is this going to be a warning that we should move away from this model?” Scott said the questions sparked by the chaos at Twitter could lead to a future in which social media is managed differently, deferred to non-profits or regulated more closely. But in the meantime, if you want to save tweets – whether jokes from a favorite celebrity or the last thoughts of a loved one who has passed – he suggests a more analog solution. “Print out their tweets, and put them in a box,” he said. “They will last longer in every way.” This article was amended on 28 November 2022. An earlier version stated that 6,000 tweets were sent each minute on Twitter, rather than each second."
"For the past year, a pair of plain-looking buildings has been at the center of a simmering conflict in a close-knit waterfront community in New York City. They look like warehouses, with tall concrete walls, loading bays and few windows. They sound like warehouses, emitting the rev of diesel engines and the chirps of reversing trucks. But by all accounts, they’re something very different. The two newcomers to Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood are hubs for Amazon’s growing last-mile delivery network. Unlike traditional warehouses, they’re bustling with around-the-clock activity, attracting convoys of cars, delivery vans, and semi-trucks to a neighborhood of narrow two-lane streets. Every day, shipments jostle through Red Hook’s crowded truck routes and make their way across New York, fulfilling Amazon’s promise of blistering-fast delivery. The new arrivals have already changed Red Hook’s streetscape – but their appearance is only the beginning. Another Amazon facility, just blocks from the others, appears to be in the final stages of construction, and it’s considerably bigger than the two existing buildings combined. Several other chunks of Red Hook have been acquired for warehousing. And all this has happened without input from the neighborhood, or even a heads-up about the facilities’ arrival. The sudden buildup in Red Hook mirrors a pattern across the United States, where companies are opening last-mile centers closer and closer to unsuspecting residential areas in an attempt to speed up delivery times. Neighbors often worry about the surge in noise, dangerous traffic, and air pollution – but it’s hard to quantify the changes that new delivery facilities bring with them. That’s why Red Hook residents, in collaboration with Consumer Reports and the Guardian, have installed air quality monitors and traffic-counting sensors near the new facilities. Environmental advocates have long called on warehouse operators to collect and publish traffic and air quality data, but since the companies haven’t done it, community members have stepped in. Already the sensors show recurring periods of poor air quality in the past two months. Thirty per cent of the time, tiny particulate matter – a major component of emissions from gas and diesel engines – was at a level the Environmental Protection Agency says can be harmful to groups sensitive to air pollution, such as people with asthma, but nonetheless labels “acceptable”. (Most of Red Hook has higher asthma rates than typical for New York City.) The rest of the time, air quality was in the “satisfactory” zone. The sensors also picked up a decline in air quality in a span that coincided with the first two months of operation for the larger of the two Amazon facilities open in the neighborhood. Particulate levels were in the EPA’s “moderate” category 17% of the time in the first half of the monitoring period, and 45% of the time in the second half. Meanwhile, our vehicle-counting sensors also detected high levels of truck traffic on an important commercial corridor. Since this early data was gathered while Red Hook’s two Amazon delivery centers were already operating, it’s impossible to say whether these trends are directly connected to the new facilities. But they do show that Red Hook’s traffic and air quality levels are already worrying – and will probably deteriorate as more facilities open in the neighborhood. “First of all, it’s too many trucks,” says Tiffiney Davis, executive director of the Red Hook Art Project, a non-profit that organizes classes, workshops, and tutoring for underserved students in the neighborhood. “These trucks shouldn’t be in a predominantly residential area, sneaking up in areas they shouldn’t be on. They’re putting children and families in danger.” In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson, Simone Griffin, said the company “partners with community stakeholders” before choosing to open a facility in a new community. Asked whether Amazon tracks air quality or traffic patterns near its facilities, Griffin didn’t respond directly, pointing instead to Amazon’s pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. The situation in Red Hook is helping drive local and state legislation putting new restrictions on delivery facilities. These rules, if passed, could become a model for warehouse communities nationwide. Small neighborhood in a big city Hemmed in on three sides by water and on the fourth by the enormous Bronx-Queens Expressway, Red Hook is a quasi-island in south Brooklyn. Its low buildings and industrial waterfront make it feel suspended in time, and its relative quiet has long attracted residents looking for a small community in the big city. Since Hurricane Sandy upended the neighborhood a decade ago, it has sprouted some shiny, expensive new condos. But old-timers, including residents of Brooklyn’s largest public housing development, still greet each other by name on the streets. Red Hook’s industrial history planted the seeds for its new chapter as a warehousing hub. Two-thirds of Red Hook is zoned in such a way that last-mile operators can develop on it without asking special permission or notifying residents, according to an analysis by the Guardian and Consumer Reports. That’s how Amazon, UPS, and several commercial real estate companies first arrived, largely unnoticed. “Right now, they are essentially unregulated,” says Alok Disa, a senior research and policy analyst at Earthjustice, a non-profit legal organization. “The current zoning approach considers these massive e-commerce mega-warehouses to be the same as a traditional mom-and-pop warehouse that’s storing a bunch of furniture for a month or two.” Residents and community leaders say they learned about the newcomers secondhand, rather than via formal outreach. “We went over and knocked on the door of the [construction] trailer,” says Catherine McBride, director of community building at Red Hook Initiative (RHI), a longtime neighborhood non-profit. “That’s when we learned that it was Amazon.” Amazon vehicles have added to the volume of trucks and vans constantly squeezing through neighborhood streets. Over the course of two months, a traffic sensor we installed on a main street counted nearly one truck per minute, on average, in the 11 o’clock hour. On one particularly busy day, the sensor detected nearly 2.5 passing trucks per minute between 11 and noon. The minutes add up quickly: trucks were captured by our sensors more than 3,900 times on an average weekday. Some warehouse developers promised that the new facilities would bring job opportunities for local residents, not just traffic. Amazon has occasionally set up job booths during events at the Red Hook Houses, the large public housing development. It’s an attractive proposition for a neighborhood with high unemployment and a large proportion of low-income residents. Not all residents are receptive to the overtures. “They’ve offered some jobs, but Amazon is not known to be the best of employers,” says Tevina Willis, a resident of the Red Hook Houses and community organizing manager at RHI. The Guardian reported on hazardous conditions at a large Amazon warehouse in Staten Island in 2020, and this year, workers at that facility cited poor working conditions as one reason for organizing a historic workers’ union. ‘Convenience comes at a cost’ Recently, advocacy organizations and policymakers have taken note of what’s going on in Red Hook, assembling a suite of policy proposals that would put New York at the forefront of regulating last-mile warehousing. Lawmakers focused on the neighborhood because it’s become a testing ground for the unchecked expansion of last-mile delivery networks directly adjacent to residential areas. “It’s an issue of economic justice,” says Jenny Zhang, chief of staff to the state assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes, a Democrat whose district includes Red Hook. (Zhang left her role after being interviewed for this story.) “There’s an underlying understanding that some of the conveniences we experience in modern life come at a cost. When private industry cannot mitigate some of the worst impacts of business, we as a government have a responsibility to mitigate those impacts.” Neighborhood advocates say it’s deeply unfair that Red Hook is playing host to the dense cluster of last-mile facilities, in part because it piles more safety and environmental risks on to years of neglect and environmental harm. Several existing and planned sites are near the Red Hook Houses, the public housing development that’s home to about 6,000 people. Asthma rates among residents are well above average for New York City, and repairs to damage caused by Hurricane Sandy are still incomplete more than 10 years after the storm brought destructive floodwaters to the low-lying waterfront neighborhood. “It’s always our under-resourced, underdeveloped areas in our communities where we’re noticing this pattern of these super-large facilities coming into the neighborhood,” says Willis, the RHI organizer who lives in the Red Hook Houses. “And they also don’t offer the community anything.” In an investigation published last year, Consumer Reports and the Guardian found that Amazon opened the majority of its warehouses in neighborhoods of color, relative to the cities the facilities served. The warehouses were also in lower-income neighborhoods than typical in the surrounding city, we found. Griffin, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company was working to address Red Hook’s “most immediate needs”. For example, Amazon had donated to local schools, a senior center, a recreational league, and an artists’ group. Griffin also said the Red Hook facilities employed some people from the neighborhood, but would not share how many. Four policy proposals are aimed at the last-mile issue: three in New York City and one at the state level. Together, they’re an unprecedented attempt to restrain companies like Amazon, UPS and FedEx from opening polluting clusters of last-mile facilities without engaging with the communities that will host them, and without reporting on the traffic and air quality impacts they bring with them. “This very much feels like a David and Goliath situation,” says the New York City councilmember Alexa Avilés, who sponsored several of the city proposals, and whose district includes Red Hook. “[Amazon] is one of the most powerful companies in the world, and it generally gets what it wants.” Asked about the cluster of facilities in Red Hook, Amazon’s Griffin said: “We’re always looking to locate our facilities as close as possible to our customers and employees. We also have a large customer and employee presence in Brooklyn.” In September, Last Mile Coalition, a group of advocacy organizations that includes Earthjustice, submitted a proposal to change the city’s zoning rules. If adopted, it would require operators to get a special permit before opening a last-mile facility. The permitting process would require companies to share public estimates of new traffic and air quality impacts. The proposal also aims to prevent clusters of last-mile facilities like the one in Red Hook. At the same time, members of New York City council are proposing bills that would require last-mile warehouses to get licenses from the city before they can operate – a complement to the zoning amendment – and require the city to redesign its network of truck routes and install air quality monitors on major roads, including at every adjacent park or playground. And Mitaynes, the assemblymember whose district includes Red Hook, sponsored a state bill that would change how all but the smallest warehouses are regulated across New York. It would implement an “indirect source review”, a type of environmental regulation that exists only in a few places in the US. Under the proposal, warehouse operators would have to report publicly on the truck and van traffic they create, and prove to the state that the traffic won’t lead to any new air quality standard violations. They would also have to take steps to mitigate the harmful effects of the traffic, such as by electrifying their delivery fleets. The interventions are united by a common worry: that clusters of facilities will threaten residents – especially kids and seniors – going to and from schools, public parks, senior centers and other community centers. These concerns loom large at Basis Independent Brooklyn, a private school that sits cater-corner from a year-old Amazon Fresh facility, and one short block from the Amazon facility being constructed just off the waterfront. Red Hook’s truck route separates the school from the neighborhood’s enormous park complex – large portions of which are soon to reopen after a decade of closure to detoxify the fields – interfering with the school’s raucous daily dropoff and pickup routine. “As a crossing guard, I’m worried about the uptick in traffic,” says Jo Golfarb, director of communications at the school. “There needs to be a limit on how many of these facilities can be built in one neighborhood. Otherwise, it’s just insanity.” To avoid dangerous run-ins with the new truck and van traffic, Basis moved its pickup and dropoff zone further away from the school, and it has considered moving its pickup and dropoff times to lessen the risk. Two other schools, a daycare and a senior center also sit on the busy truck route. For Willamae Boling, a research librarian who lives between the Red Hook Houses and the Amazon Fresh facility, the uptick in truck and van traffic spells danger. It’s one reason Boling started asking questions about the new facilities in the neighborhood. “My dad was killed by a driver, and that reoriented my whole life,” Boling says. “I look at these and I only see the potential for someone to die. I think it’s very likely.” Methodology: We gathered this data using a pair of traffic-counting instruments made by a Brooklyn company called Numina, and air quality monitors from PurpleAir."
"Tesla is suing the Swedish transport agency, accusing it of a “discriminatory attack” on the US electric carmaker, after strike action prevented its new vehicles from getting licence plates in Sweden. The lawsuit is an escalation in a row that started between the car company and the union representing Swedish Telsa workers, who are calling for collective bargaining rights and have been on strike for five weeks. The strike called by IF Metall, which has more than 300,000 members in Swedish industry, has attracted multiple secondary, or sympathy, industrial action by unions representing among others postal workers, dock-workers, electricians and painters. On Thursday Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, decried the secondary action at the postal service PostNord as “insane” after licence plates were prevented from reaching new Tesla cars. According to the Swedish financial newspaper Dagens Industri, the carmaker said in documents submitted to Norrköping district court on Monday: “This confiscation of license plates constitutes a discriminatory attack without any support in law directed against Tesla.” Anna Berggrund, director of the Swedish transport agency’s vehicle information department, confirmed that it had received an interim decision from the district court to consent within seven days to Tesla collecting licence plates directly from their sign manufacturer, but that they have not yet decided how to react. She said: “It appears from the decision that our sign manufacturer has announced that it is prepared to provide the signs directly to Tesla, provided that the Swedish transport agency agrees to this. We at the Swedish transport agency now need to analyse the announcement and assess what consequences this has for us and what measures might need to be taken to implement the decision. It is currently too early to say exactly what that would mean.” Tesla has reportedly demanded that the district court allow it to collect the number plates from the manufacturer while legal procedures are carried out. This request was granted on Monday, according to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, meaning that Tesla can collect its licence plates from the manufacturer. If the Swedish transport agency does not agree to the request within seven days, they will be fined one million kroner (£76,000). A senior IF Metall official, Veli-Pekka Säikkälä, said: “We note that Tesla has chosen to take the long route, starting legal proceedings. There is a simple and quick way to solve this situation, and that is to sign a collective agreement. As soon as Tesla does that, the conflict ends. “Swedish law state that authorities should not choose sides in labour market conflicts. We assume that the Swedish Transport Agency will remain neutral in the ongoing conflict, as they should.” TM Sweden, Tesla’s Swedish subsidiary, is also understood to be pursuing legal action against PostNord for failure to deliver post. The postal company said the union ST had blockaded mail deliveries from PostNord to TM Sweden as a “sympathy measure for IF Metall”. The right to strike is “constitutionally protected and so strong that it can be considered force majeure”, PostNord added. A spokesperson said: “We now need to read the lawsuit and form an idea about the content and what it means. First and foremost PostNord is neutral in the conflict.” The fight for collective agreements – which cover conditions including salary, pension, working hours and holidays – is being portrayed as the largest attempt to save Sweden’s union model from global labour practices in decades. It has been likened to the 1995 strikes at Toys R Us, which Swedish unions won. Since the start of the Tesla strike, the Swedish global payment firm Klarna has signed a collective agreement with workers to prevent planned action at its Stockholm headquarters. Some commentators have suggested that the strikes affecting the carmaker could restart conversations on the issue at the Swedish division of the streaming firm Spotify. In Norway, Fellesforbundet, the largest union in the Norwegian private sector, has said it would block Swedish Teslas from coming to the country. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
"Major advertisers like Disney, IBM and Apple are still withholding ad dollars from Elon Musk’s X two weeks after its owner endorsed an antisemitic tweet and two days after he launched an expletive-laden tirade to describe his feelings about the pull back. Marketing agencies are pulling back from it as well. In response, X has said it plans to attract smaller and medium-sized businesses to prop up its income. “Small and medium businesses are a very significant engine that we have definitely underplayed for a long time,” a statement given by the company to the Financial Times on Friday reads. “It [was] always part of the plan – now we will go even further with it.” Last month, some of the world’s most recognizable brands halted spending on X following his endorsement of the post, and on Wednesday Musk told the boycotters to “go fuck” themselves and accused them of “blackmail” by withholding advertising to try to pressure him into greater content moderation. At the New York Times’ DealBook event, Musk vowed, “I will certainly not pander” to big advertisers and warned them that they would be held responsible for any collapse of X. Last week, the New York Times, citing leaked documents, reported X was at risk of losing up to $75m this quarter. The company told the FT it estimated the fall in ad revenue was between $10m and $12m. Half a dozen marketing agencies told the Times they would not come back to X. Steve Boehler, the founder of the marketing management consultancy Mercer Island Group, told the Times that Musk’s comments “suggest an outrageous amount of uncertainty regarding his platform, how he will partner with advertisers and whether he even cares about what advertisers think”. “This is also personal,” Boehler added. “Businesses are simply full of people, and people like to be treated well, respected and dealt with with dignity.” But Musk, who apologized on Wednesday for what he called his “dumbest” ever social media post, has also now received support from an unexpected quarter. Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager and founder of Pershing Square capital management, who in October threatened to blacklist Harvard students who had signed a letter blaming solely Israel for the attack by Hamas, said on Friday that Musk’s interview at the event was “one of the great interviews ever”. “Musk is a free speech absolutist which I respect. I think he is entirely correct that he and X are treated unfairly and inconsistently by advertisers,” Ackman wrote on X. He said that other platforms, including TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, also contained “enormous amounts of problematic content, antisemitic and otherwise, but the advertisers don’t boycott those platforms”. Ackman reasoned that Musk had been targeted “because the other media organizations view X as a competitor and any time his name is in an article about controversies, it draws clicks” and the mainstream media organizations are “incentivized to attack him”. The outspoken hedge funder also said he doubted what Musk had meant with his post was antisemitic. “After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent when he responded with the ‘actual truth’ tweet, and further clarified thereafter.” Pershing Square has an investment in X but Ackman said making a profit “is not important … I am more inclined to like and support companies that advertise on the platform because I appreciate their support for free speech.” Musk responded to Ackman’s post with an uncharacteristic concision, posting “Thank you.”"
"One of Spotify’s top executives cashed in more than $9m (£7.2m) in shares as the value of the world’s biggest music streaming service surged after it announced it was laying off almost a fifth of its workforce to cut costs. Paul Vogel, Spotify’s chief financial officer, moved to sell the $9.4m worth of stock on Tuesday, a day after investors sent the company’s share price soaring in response to reports that the cuts would help it sustain profitability amid slowing economic growth. Vogel was not the only one to cash in on the jump. Spotify’s share price rose by as much as 8% on the day of the announcement and has remained elevated since. Two other senior executives have cashed in more than $1.6m in shares, according to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On Friday, the last day of trading before Spotify announced it was to lay off about 1,500 staff, the company traded at $180 a share. On Monday, the day of the cuts announcement, it surged to $194 rising to $199 on Tuesday, when the SEC filing shows that Vogel sold 47,859 shares. Investors have continued to fuel the share price rises, which hit a 52-week high of $202.88 during trading on Wednesday, valuing the Stockholm-based company at $37.9bn. The sale of stock immediately after a round of cuts is completely legal, but the optics of appearing to cash in on a share-price surge as many staff face redundancy at Christmas are not the best. “Despite our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is too big,” Spotify’s founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek, said in a blog post announcing the cuts on Monday. “I recognise this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions. To be blunt, many smart, talented and hard-working people will be departing us.” Spotify cut 6% of its jobs in January, bringing its global workforce down to 9,200, and four months later it cut another 200 jobs, mostly in its podcasting division. The company has struggled to achieve profitability and reported a net loss of around $500m for the nine months to September, despite growing its monthly active users to 574 million in the third quarter. It has also found it difficult to make its expensive foray beyond music into podcasting pay off. In June, the company ended its multimillion-dollar deal with the media group run by Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, by mutual agreement. The couple produced just one series under their Archewell Audio podcast imprint after inking the agreement in 2020 for a reported $20m (£15.6m or A$29.1m). Spotify declined to comment."

"Sir James Dyson has lost his libel claim against the publisher of the Daily Mirror after a columnist at the newspaper stated that he had “championed Vote Leave … before moving his global head office to Singapore”. The inventor gave evidence at the Royal Courts of Justice for two days during a trial against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) over an article published in January 2022. In the Daily Mirror article, the journalist Brian Reade wrote that it must be confusing to be a young person who “wants to do the right thing”, before discussing the actions of a series of individuals including the former prime minister Boris Johnson, Prince Andrew and Dyson. He referred to the entrepreneur as “the vacuum-cleaner tycoon who championed Vote Leave due to the economic opportunities it would bring to British industry before moving his global head office to Singapore”. Reade continued: “Kids, talk the talk but then screw your country and if anyone complains, tell them to suck it up.” Dyson described the article published last year as a “personal attack on all that I have done and achieved in my lifetime” and said it was “highly distressing and hurtful”. In a written witness statement, the 76-year-old said he had made “huge investments” in the UK and prioritised “setting a good moral example to young people”. He continued: “So to be accused by the defendant in the articles of being a hypocrite who had screwed the country and who set a poor moral example to young people is not only wrong, but incredibly harmful to my reputation.” However, MGN defended the claim, including by arguing that Reade’s article was “honest opinion”. In a ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Jay dismissed the inventor’s claim, finding that MGN’s defence had succeeded and that Dyson had not proved that he had suffered serious harm to his reputation. He said: “In the present case, the claimant cannot demonstrate that he has suffered financial loss as a result of these publications. Nor can he show that his philanthropic work, particularly directed to young people and schools, has been harmed in any way.” In the 34-page ruling, the judge described Dyson as “an honest witness, albeit one with a particular world-view”. In his evidence, Dyson argued that the decision to establish Dyson’s global headquarters in Singapore “had no material impact upon Dyson’s UK operations or its commitment to the UK, or to the amount of corporation tax paid in the UK”. In his decision on Friday, Jay said he had to consider “whether an honest commentator could think that the claimant has screwed the country, in other words has harmed it in some way, by acting as he did”. The judge concluded: “Mr Reade was not attempting to offer a window into or shine a light on the claimant’s thought processes or motivation. He could not, and did not, claim to do that. “Rather, the ‘screwed his country, etc’ remark was Mr Reade’s ‘take’ on how people would or might envisage the claimant’s actions.” The judge continued: “Given that Mr Reade fell short of accusing the claimant of dishonesty, the scope for honest comment, however wounding and unbalanced, was very considerable indeed.” After the decision, an MGN spokesperson said: “We welcome today’s judgment, which upholds the rights of our columnists to share honestly held opinions, even about powerful or wealthy individuals.” During the trial, Justin Rushbrooke KC, for Dyson, said in written submissions that the articles, in print and online, “constituted a serious and unjustified slur on Sir James’s reputation, business and personal”. Adrienne Page KC, for MGN, said the words in the article were “substantially correct” and that Dyson could not dictate how the commentator posed them. A spokesperson for Dyson said the company employed 3,700 people in the UK and paid more UK corporation tax after 2019 than before. They said: “[Dyson] continues to invest vast sums in the UK, files more patents than any other company, and in 2017 founded a university in Malmesbury which has educated hundreds of undergraduates who pay no tuition fees while earning a salary and even paying tax.”"
"The firing of Sam Altman as chief executive of OpenAI on Friday took the tech world by surprise and has triggered a Silicon Valley corporate drama. Altman is not just the CEO of the company behind the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot. He is also the figurehead of a revolution in AI that has enthralled the public and investors but also alarmed industry insiders and experts. Here we answer some key questions about what’s been going on and why it matters. What is OpenAI? OpenAI is the San Francisco-based company behind ChatGPT, a chatbot that has wowed users with its ability to produce highly convincing text responses to human prompts – from writing academic essays to creating recipes and summarising lengthy documents. It has also developed Dall-E, a tool that produces images from text prompts. Before last week’s events, OpenAI was reportedly in talks to complete a fundraising deal that would have valued the business at $80bn (£64bn). Altman, its 38-year-old boss, was synonymous with the success of ChatGPT, which attracted 100 million users in two months after its launch on 30 November 2022. Why was Altman fired? OpenAI was founded as a non-profit organisation and its board oversees a commercial subsidiary of which Altman is CEO. On Friday the board announced that it had fired Altman because “he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board” and was thus “hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities”. The board gave no further details about the communications in question. Altman’s ultimate successor as interim CEO, Emmett Shear, a co-founder of the Twitch streaming platform, said the sacking was not due to any disagreement over safety. Experts and tech professionals have voiced concerns that companies such as OpenAI are developing AI systems too rapidly and that such technology could ultimately pose an existential threat. However, it was reported that Altman has held discussions with Apple’s former design chief Jony Ive about building a new AI hardware device. He is also reportedly trying to raise funds for a new venture producing chips that develop and operate powerful AI systems. What has happened since? In a weekend of corporate drama, OpenAI’s investors, led by the biggest, Microsoft, attempted to reinstate Altman. The move had the support of OpenAI staff including the then interim CEO, OpenAI’s chief technology officer Mira Murati. Murati has since been replaced by Shear, OpenAI’s third CEO in three days. On Monday, Microsoft announced it had hired Altman and his close colleague, the former OpenAI president Greg Brockman, to head a new advanced AI research unit. What does this mean for OpenAI? OpenAI’s 700-strong workforce is in uproar about Altman’s sacking. In an open letter to the board of directors published on Monday, more than 600 staff, including Murati, threatened to resign and join Microsoft unless the board quit and reinstated Altman and Brockman (who had resigned after he and Altman were axed from the board). One of the signatories was Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist and one of the four remaining board members. Sustkever said on Monday he “deeply” regretted his role in Altman’s departure. Could Microsoft buy OpenAI? Money would not be a major issue for Microsoft, even with OpenAI’s mooted $80bn price tag. However, competition authorities in the US, the UK and the EU would be expected to take a close look at consolidation in the nascent market for generative AI. Microsoft has only just pulled off the acquisition of the videogame company behind Call of Duty, Activision Blizzard – a takeover that was heavily contested by regulators – and would face an even tougher battle with OpenAI, in which it owns a 49% stake. Will the furore slowdown AI development? Microsoft has signalled that it is a ready home for OpenAI’s disgruntled talent and has already put Altman and Brockman to work. Its CEO, Satya Nadella, indicated that other OpenAI staff had already joined the top duo, amid reports that a trio of senior researchers had quit the ChatGPT developer in the wake of the boardroom coup. If Altman does not return to OpenAI, then it seems the work on advanced AI will continue under Microsoft directly. Altman is committed to building artificial general intelligence, the term for an AI system that can carry out a variety of tasks at or above a human level of intelligence. In an interview this month he said: “The vision is to make AGI, figure out how to make it safe  …  and figure out the benefits.” OpenAI still owns the powerful models behind ChatGPT. But Elon Musk’s latest venture, xAI, has shown how quickly powerful new models can be built. It unveiled Grok, a prototype AI chatbot, after what the company claimed was just four months of development."
"Threads launched in the European Union on Thursday, further expanding the Meta-owned platform’s user base and dealing another blow to competitor Twitter/X. Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the launch in a post on Threads. Threads, known as a “Twitter killer” app, launched in July 2023 and was immediately available in the US and more than 100 other countries, including the UK. However, its debut on the continent lagged due to strict privacy laws in the region. Before launching in the EU, Meta first needed to seek approval from the European Commission over the app’s privacy provisions. Many speculated the delay was due to the EU Digital Markets Act, which addresses a variety of big tech antitrust and privacy concerns – including sharing content across platforms. Meta did not specifically cite the act as the reason for the delay, but the Instagram executive Adam Mosseri said: “The complexities with complying with some of the laws coming into effect next year are significant.” Creating an account on Threads requires users to have an Instagram account. In other markets, users were at first unable to delete their Threads account without deleting their linked Instagram account. Meta changed the setting in November. However, with Thursday’s launch, Meta is giving users the option to browse Threads without creating a profile on the app or on Instagram. “People who use Threads without a profile can browse content on Threads, search for accounts, share content via link copying or platform sharing, and report Threads content, but can’t create a post or interact with content,” Meta said in a blogpost announcing the change. Threads launched in July 2023 and quickly amassed more than 100 million users in its first week. The platform has since seen a large drop off in active users, but Zuckerberg in earnings calls has remained steadfast that the platform would eventually reach its goal of 1 billion users. “I’m highly confident we’re going to be able to pour enough gasoline on this to help it grow,” he said. X has meanwhile continued its downward spiral, losing several of its top advertisers and shrinking its daily active users by 13% since Elon Musk took over as CEO in 2022. Bloomberg reported X’s revenue slumped to $2.5bn in 2023, a significant decline from years prior. In addition to the EU launch, Meta announced on Thursday it would create more interoperability with Threads – meaning it would allow posts on Threads to appear on other social platforms. The project is related to the “fediverse”, a collection of social networks that allow data and posts to be shared between them. “Making Threads interoperable will give people more choice over how they interact and it will help content reach more people,” Zuckerberg said on Threads. “I’m pretty optimistic about this.”"
"Hamas has invited Elon Musk to Gaza to witness the devastation of the Palestinian territory under Israeli attack after the hi-tech billionaire accompanied Benjamin Netanyahu to inspect a kibbutz targeted by Hamas. “We invite him to visit Gaza to see the extent of the massacres and destruction committed against the people of Gaza, in compliance with the standards of objectivity and credibility,” Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said in a press conference in Beirut on Tuesday. Musk’s appearance on Monday alongside the Israeli prime minister at Kfar Aza, a kibbutz 2 miles (3km) from the Gaza border where more than 50 people were killed by Hamas attackers, also drew criticism from Israelis. On 15 November, the co-founder of the Tesla electric car company and the owner of the X social media platform formerly known as Twitter tweeted and endorsed a post accusing Jews of “hatred against whites”, and the next day endorsed a post that said: “Everyone is allowed to be proud of their race, except for white people.” The retweets were not mentioned on Musk’s visit to Kfar Aza, and the tycoon instead made remarks agreeing with Netanyahu’s portrayal of the war on Hamas. “Those that are intent on murder must be neutralised,” he said. “The propaganda must stop that is training people to be murderers in the future. And then, making Gaza prosperous. And if that happens, I think it will be a good future.” Musk’s visit to Israel came during a pause in the Israeli military campaign to allow Hamas to release hostages and Israel to free Palestinian prisoners from its jails, but Netanyahu has vowed that Israel will resume operations as soon as the temporary ceasefire was over. The death toll among people in Gaza is estimated by the Hamas-run authorities as more than 14,000. “Within 50 days, Israel dropped more than 40,000 tonnes of explosives on the homes of defenseless Gazans,” Hamdam said. “I call on US President Biden to review the US relationship with Israel and to stop supplying them with weapons.” Joe Biden has largely supported Israel in its military campaign, and the US has helped replenish Israeli stocks of weapons and ammunition, but his administration has more recently expressed unease at the high civilian death rate, and called for Israel to change its tactics before taking the war into southern Gaza. • This article was amended on 29 November 2023 to remove an incorrect description of Elon Musk as Tesla’s founder. Musk is included in the company’s list of co-founders."
"The anti-hate speech group being sued by Elon Musk’s X has accused the company of lodging a claim “riddled with legal deficiencies” and trying to intimidate and censor it, amid growing pressure over the platform’s pro-Nazi content and its owner’s support for an antisemitic post. The Center for Countering Digital Hate has filed a motion to dismiss a civil lawsuit brought by X, formerly Twitter, which accused the non-profit organisation of a number of legal breaches. The X lawsuit included an allegation that CCDH, a prominent critic of X’s content moderation standards under Musk’s ownership, had breached the site’s terms of service by scraping it for data subsequently used as evidence in the nonprofit’s research. The US-UK campaign group said X’s complaint was related to its dislike of CCDH’s criticism of the platform, not an alleged breached of contract terms. “X Corp’s claims are riddled with legal deficiencies on their own terms,” said CCDH’s filing. “They also all share one fundamental flaw: at its core, X Corp’s grievance is not that the CCDH defendants gathered public data in violation of obscure (and largely imagined) contract terms, but that they criticized X Corp (forcefully) to the public.” In a statement released alongside the filing, the nonprofit said the X lawsuit was an “attempt to censor, intimidate, and silence the CCDH by burdening us with the financial cost of a legal defense”. X is demanding unspecified damages from CCDH. Its complaint in a California federal court, filed in July, alleged that CCDH’s reports have cost it tens of millions of dollars in lost advertising business. CCDH announced last month that it had raised $100,000 towards its legal costs in a public fundraising campaign. CCDH has filed its counter-motion in a US district court in San Francisco under California’s laws combating strategic lawsuits against public participation, or Slapps. Such lawsuits are viewed by critics as attempts to quell public criticism, and anti-Slapp laws have been brought in by some US states to prevent the shutting-down of free speech. Responding to the data-scraping accusation, the motion to dismiss says CCDH used the platform’s “own search function to collect publicly available information”. CCDH’s legal move came as X scrambled to deal with accusations of failing to crack down on pro-Nazi content on the platform, while Musk has been accused of making antisemitic comments on his X account. The technology firm IBM pulled its advertising from X on Thursday after a report from the US campaign group Media Matters that its ads were appearing next to content touting Adolf Hitler and supporting the Third Reich. “IBM has zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination and we have immediately suspended all advertising on X while we investigate this entirely unacceptable situation,” the company said. Linda Yaccarino, the X chief executive, said in a post on the platform on Thursday that the company was against discrimination. “X’s point of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should STOP across the board,” she wrote on Thursday. “I think that’s something we can and should all agree on.” Yaccarino’s post followed an outcry on Wednesday over Musk’s support on X for a post from an account that said: “Jewish communties [sic] have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.” Musk replied: “You have said the actual truth.” Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, which has been threatened with legal action by Musk, wrote: “At a time when antisemitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one’s influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories.”"
"The police will be able to run facial recognition searches on a database containing images of Britain’s 50 million driving licence holders under a law change being quietly introduced by the government. Should the police wish to put a name to an image collected on CCTV, or shared on social media, the legislation would provide them with the powers to search driving licence records for a match. The move, contained in a single clause in a new criminal justice bill, could put every driver in the country in a permanent police lineup, according to privacy campaigners. Facial recognition searches match the biometric measurements of an identified photograph, such as that contained on driving licences, to those of an image picked up elsewhere. The intention to allow the police or the National Crime Agency (NCA) to exploit the UK’s driving licence records is not explicitly referenced in the bill or in its explanatory notes, raising criticism from leading academics that the government is “sneaking it under the radar”. Once the criminal justice bill is enacted, the home secretary, James Cleverly, must establish “driver information regulations” to enable the searches, but he will need only to consult police bodies, according to the bill. Critics claim facial recognition technology poses a threat to the rights of individuals to privacy, freedom of expression, non-discrimination and freedom of assembly and association. Police are increasingly using live facial recognition, which compares a live camera feed of faces against a database of known identities, at major public events such as protests. Prof Peter Fussey, a former independent reviewer of the Met’s use of facial recognition, said there was insufficient oversight of the use of facial recognition systems, with ministers worryingly silent over studies that showed the technology was prone to falsely identifying black and Asian faces. He said: “This constitutes another example of how facial recognition surveillance is becoming extended without clear limits or independent oversight of its use. The minister highlights how such technologies are useful and convenient. That police find such technologies useful or convenient is not sufficient justification to override the legal human rights protections they are also obliged to uphold.” Access to driving licence records is controlled under regulations related to the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, which requires the police to provide a good cause relating to a contravention of mainly road traffic acts. An explanatory note to the new criminal justice bill says that “clause 21 clarifies who can access the driver data and enables regulations to provide for access to DVLA driver information for all policing or law enforcement purposes”. The policing minister, Chris Philp, made a first explicit reference to what appears to be the unsaid purpose of the legislative change during a first committee sitting of MPs scrutinising the bill on 12 December. Questioning Graeme Biggar, the director general of the National Crime Agency, Philp said: “There is a power in clause 21 to allow police and law enforcement, including the NCA, to access driving licence records to do a facial recognition search, which, anomalously, is currently quite difficult. “When you get a crime scene image from CCTV or something like that, do you agree it would be useful to be able to do a facial recognition search across DVLA records as well as the other records that can currently be accessed?” Biggar responded: “Yes, it would. It is really important for us to be able to use facial recognition more. I know that is an issue you have been championing.” The EU had considered making images on its member states’ driving licence records available on the Prüm crime fighting database. The proposal was dropped earlier this year as it was said to represent a disproportionate breach of privacy. Philp is known to be an enthusiast for facial recognition technology and has encouraged the police to use it more often. The Home Office is already seeking to integrate data from the police national database (PND), the Passport Office and the EU settled status database into a single system to help police find an image match with the “click of one button”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Clause 21 in the criminal justice bill clarifies the law around safeguarding and accountability of police force’s use of DVLA records. “It does not allow for automatic access to DVLA records for facial recognition. Any further developments would be subject to further engagement as the public would expect.” Carole McCartney, a professor of law and criminal justice at the University of Leicester, said the lack of consultation over the change in law raised questions over the legitimacy of the new powers. She said: “This is another slide down the ‘slippery slope’ of allowing police access to whatever data they so choose – with little or no safeguards. Where is the public debate? How is this legitimate if the public don’t accept the use of the DVLA and passport databases in this way?” The government scrapped the role of the commissioner for the retention and use of biometric material and the office of surveillance camera commissioner this summer, leaving ministers without an independent watchdog to scrutinise such legislative changes. Chris Jones, the director at Statewatch, a civil liberties NGO, called on MPs to reject the controversial change. He said: “There has been no public announcement of or consultation over this plan, which will put anyone in the country with a driving licence into a permanent police lineup. Opening up civil databases to mass police searches turns everyone, a priori, into a suspect. More surveillance and snooping powers will not make people safer.” In 2020, the court of appeal ruled that South Wales police’s use of facial recognition technology had breached privacy rights, data protection laws and equality laws, given the risk the technology could have a race or gender bias. The force has continued to use the technology. Live facial recognition is to be deployed to find a match of people attending Christmas markets this year against a watchlist. Katy Watts, a lawyer at the civil rights advocacy group Liberty said: “This is a shortcut to widespread surveillance by the state and we should all be worried by it.”"
"On New Year’s Eve 25 years ago, sane people worried that the modern world was about to melt down. The millennium bug seemed to be threatening to crash the world’s computer systems, as technology struggled to distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000. The public, faced with daily predictions of potentially terrible outcomes, braced themselves nervously. Dark jokes prevailed about avoiding being on “a life-support system at midnight on 31 December 1999”. In China, Zhao Be, then the head of the country’s millennium bug coordination efforts, commanded airline executives to be on a flight on 1 January 2000 to demonstrate any problems had been sorted. Yet, in the end, nobody appeared to perish. The same might be said of one of the earliest events to reveal the existence of the bug, which was also known as Y2K. In 1987 Marks &amp; Spencer received a batch of tinned meat that was rejected because the company’s computers thought it was almost 90 years past its January 2000 use-by date. Five years later, a Minnesota kindergarten invited one Mary Bandar to join its classes. She was 104 at the time. These quirky errors were the result of early computer scientists solving a practical problem. To save space and speed up processing, computer dates were abbreviated. So January 1900 was 01/00 and December 1999 was 12/99. Trailblazing computer scientists had assumed that none of the computers would be in use by 1999. Only, it turned out there were so many legacy systems in operation that catastrophic results appeared a certainty to some. One British family – the Perrons – abandoned their Wiltshire home in 1998 and headed to a hillside cottage near Forres, Moray, as they feared food shortages, the accidental discharge of nuclear weapons, the breakdown of global capitalism and rioting on the streets. Their new property had no running water or electricity but did possess its own generator, while water was available from a nearby stream and the family grew vegetables in their garden and ate eggs provided by their hens. This level of preparedness would have given them full marks from Action 2000, a UK government taskforce created during the period to monitor computer readiness. With a budget of £17m, it would name and shame government departments and councils it judged were not ready – and the clamour to throw money at the problem grew and grew. The research firm Gartner estimated the total global cost of millennium bug remediation to be as high as $600bn (£475bn). Yet, despite all of the effort and cost, issues still occurred. Internationally, 15 nuclear reactors shut down; there were power cuts in Hawaii; and the bug was blamed for more than 150 pregnant women being given incorrect results of a Down’s syndrome test. But the enduring story was how few problems actually occurred. The Perrons’ stash of stockpiled medicines remained untouched and life continued much as it had done before – prompting criticisms that the risks had been overstated. Some even threatened legal action as they suggested technology companies had exaggerated the likely effects of the bug – while communist Cuba dismissed the warnings as a capitalist conspiracy to boost spending on computers. These allegations were met with fury by the industry. As Martyn Thomas, who led Deloitte Consulting’sY2K work internationally in the mid-1990s, argued in the Guardian in 2019: “The millennium bug was real and the internationally coordinated effort was a great success. Tens of thousands of failures were prevented. Some suppliers took advantage and sold unnecessary upgrades to their customers, but those of us who worked days, nights and weekends to meet the hard deadline of December 1999 are angered when ignorant people think that because we succeeded, the threat was not serious.” Still, countries such as Italy, Russia and South Korea were said to have done little to prepare for Y2K, and yet appeared to experience no more technological problems than countries writing huge cheques. US spending was about double that of Italy’s, according to a weighted Y2K Spending Index compiled by the market intelligence group, International Data Corporation (IDC). In the aftermath, Margaret Beckett, who led the UK government’s Y2K work, said: “It is not true that some of international partners ‘spent next to nothing’. We know from our many contacts in the International Year 2000 Co-operation Centre that a huge amount of work was done across the world, including Russia, Asia, Latin America and Africa.” Or, as the trade publication Computer Weekly put it on 13 January 2000: “Two weeks into the new year, and the millennium bug is beginning to look like one of the greatest non-events in history. After dire predictions of global recession, nuclear meltdowns, and food shortages, 1 January was a serious anticlimax.”"
"The AI chipmaker Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and the engine of the artificial-intelligence boom, rolled out another set of quarterly results on Wednesday to investors’ delight. The company, whose value has soared by $2.2tn this year to $3.6tn on the back of near-doubling of chip sales, said it had revenue of $35.08bn, against expectations of $33.15bn. Its profits more than doubled year-over-year. Revenue surged 94% from the same quarter last year. The company projected that revenue would increase by 70% in the coming quarter. Analysts anticipated Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share; the company reported $0.81. Shares of Nvidia fell about 5% in extended trading following the announcement but soon recouped the losses to remain at a similar price; they previously closed at $145.89 in New York. The Nvidia chief, Jensen Huang, who last week said he expected the computing power driving advances in generative AI to increase by “a millionfold” over the next decade, said in a press release. In an earnings call, Huang said that global adoption of Nvidia technology was creating a platform shift from coding to machine learning, with traditional data centers being rebuilt for machine learning to produce AI. “Generative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence – a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry,” he said. “AI is transforming every industry, company and country,” Huang added. “Creating an omniverse of synthetically generated data … the age of robotics is coming.” Soaring demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU chips appears to have quelled anxiety that the company could be hit by pullback in demand from tech giants sinking billions into AI processing and data centers. Nvidia’s value has bounced back after a summer slump, rising 45% from an August low. The chip stock – up nearly 200% this year and up over 1,100% in the last two years – hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia’s chip-making peers have become a net drag on the industry as they struggle to compete with its AI dominance. Before the results were announced, the Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expected another “drop-the-mic performance” from Nvidia, saying it was “the only game in town with $1tn+ of AI cap-ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia’s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world”. The world’s biggest tech companies have increased the amount they invest in AI by billions in recent quarters, positioning Nvidia as a major beneficiary. Nvidia, which many see as a bellwether of the tech sector and artificial-intelligence demand that has helped power Wall Street to multiple record highs this year. But an escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, the threat of global tariff hikes from Donald Trump’s incoming administration, and the likelihood that US interest rates will not be cut by the Federal Reserve have also put markets on edge. Other analysts agreed with Ives’s assessment that demand for Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip could push Nvidia sales and market capitalization to new heights. The Saxo chief investment strategist Charu Chanana wrote that signs of “extraordinary demand” for the new chip, including forecasts of record sales and reports of sold-out inventories for the next year, are strong indicators of Nvidia’s continued high performance. But Chanana warned that “any signs of production delays or demand falling short could pressure the stock given its stretched valuation”. Earlier this week, a report said that the chipmaker is having overheating issues with servers for its newest graphics chip, B200 &amp; GB200 NVL72, both named for David Harold Blackwell, a prominent American mathematician and statistician. A spokesperson for Nvidia did not reject the report directly but said “the engineering iterations are normal and expected”. The computer billionaire Michael Dell posted that “minutiae can shake you out of tremendous investments every time”."

"Using the power of the social media platform he owns and the threat of spending millions against Republicans in primaries, Elon Musk effectively tanked a bipartisan congressional spending bill that would have kept the government running. After their initial failure at Musk’s hands, House Republicans on Thursday scrambled to put together another deal, which they said would provide a few months of spending and, according to reports, suspend the debt limit at Donald Trump’s request. The pared-down spending bill failed to pass the US House in a vote on Thursday evening. The world’s richest man flexed the muscle he gained during the 2024 election, in which he spent big to help elect Trump and spread rightwing rumors on X. Since the spending bill was introduced, Musk has fired off tweet after tweet attacking it, amplifying false claims about what it includes and dooming its fate. “‘Shutting down’ the government (which doesn’t actually shut down critical functions btw) is infinitely better than passing a horrible bill,” Musk wrote in one post. He and the account for the “department of government efficiency” or Doge, a government body that Trump says he’ll create , claimed the bill would significantly raise pay for members of Congress – it wouldn’t. He claimed it includes funding for bioweapons – it does not. He erroneously shared that it would direct billions for a stadium in DC. He offensively used the word “retard” to joke about language changes in the bill, then joked further about his use of the word. Trump and JD Vance opposed the bill, releasing a statement about it, but did not speak out publicly to nearly the degree Musk did. Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded to the Muskmania by boosting her boss as the party’s leader. “As soon as President Trump released his official stance on the CR, Republicans on Capitol Hill echoed his point of view. President Trump is the leader of the Republican party. Full stop,” she said. Musk urged people to contact their lawmakers to kill the bill. And when the bill was effectively killed, he claimed the victory was the voice of the people: “America is for you, the beloved people.” Musk has no formal role in the second Trump administration aside from being tapped to helm an external group, but he showed this week the extreme influence he has on the party – and on the incoming presidency. The ordeal is a sign of what’s to come for Musk in his influential role, with a social media platform he can use to go after those he disagrees with. His tweets receive millions of impressions and signal to the rightwing online ecosystem what the lines of attack will be. He has indicated this is just the beginning, saying no bill should be passed until Trump takes office. He also promised that his group has “no choice” but to go after public servants because “unless @DOGE ends the careers of deceitful, pork-barrel politicians, the waste and corruption will never stop”. Congressional Republicans mostly cheered him on. Rand Paul, the senator from Kentucky, suggested on Thursday morning that Musk should become the speaker of the House, noting that the speaker doesn’t have to be a member of Congress, as it is traditionally. “Nothing would disrupt the swamp more than electing Elon Musk … think about it … nothing’s impossible. (not to mention the joy at seeing the collective establishment, aka ‘uniparty,’ lose their ever-lovin’ minds),” Paul wrote on X. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia congresswoman, said she was open to the idea of Musk as speaker. “DOGE can only truly be accomplished by reigning in Congress to enact real government efficiency. The establishment needs to be shattered just like it was yesterday. This could be the way,” she wrote on X. Democrats called Musk the president, the co-president and the fourth branch of government, saying he’s shown he’s more powerful than Trump, according to Axios. Mark Pocan, a Democratic representative from Wisconsin, created AI images of Musk controlling Trump, including one where Musk is being sworn in by the incoming president. “We just returned from the future and got this photo from the inauguration,” Pocan wrote. One piece of misinformation Musk perpetuated about the bill is that it would have given lawmakers an eye-popping 40% raise, bringing their pay from $174,000 to $243,000. This is not true – it does include a cost-of-living raise of 3.8%, or $6,600. The Doge tweet claiming the massive increase has not been corrected. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican Texas congressman, was caught in the rumor mill of the pay raise. Some accounts claimed he was the one pushing for the raise, which Crenshaw said was false. He responded to those accounts by calling one a “fucking lying piece of shit” and “fucking incel”, and another an “anonymous coward” who was “talking shit without any evidence”. Musk responded to the claims of Crenshaw’s involvement by saying “Congress should only get a raise when the budget is balanced”. Crenshaw then came back at Musk with: “I love you Elon but you need to take 5 seconds to check your sources before highlighting bottom feeders looking for clicks.” • This article was amended on 20 December 2024.

"When Jorge Rivera-Herrans released part of Epic: the Musical last Christmas, he managed to push Taylor Swift off the top of the US iTunes album charts. So there is a lot at stake when the final instalment of his musical retelling of the Odyssey is released on Christmas Day. Rivera-Herrans’s project has already been an extraordinary success, with more monthly listeners on Spotify (1.6m) than veterans such as Morrissey, Liam Gallagher, or the Sex Pistols, and 119m plays on the platform in the past 28 days alone. “I wanted to have sword fights and the ocean, and I wanted to have gods and monsters, and spells and love and lust and revenge,” he told the Observer. “I want people to have this feeling of wonder, that people can watch it and feel like a child again.” Epic is a musical, but not a theatre production. At least, not yet. It is a 40-track concept album with Rivera-Herrans singing the part of Odysseus on his 10-year voyage home to Ithaca after the siege of Troy, with each step released on TikTok. Epic feeds two obsessions of teenagers at the vanguard of generation Alpha: Greek mythology and fan participation. Rivera-Herrans began writing and recording in his bedroom studio, later building a soundproofed vocal booth with his father. While most artists are determined not to risk spoiling their magic by revealing creative secrets, Rivera-Herrans is the opposite. He has shared everything from song motifs to orchestration choices and the audition process. “I was terrified at first,” he said. “The first time I put a video on TikTok I was so nervous I did not sleep that night. But it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done, because what’s so cool about getting to show the process online is that we’re all on an odyssey together. You get to see in real time what works and what doesn’t.” The first songs were solo affairs, but Rivera-Herrans then held auditions on TikTok, with candidates posting their own videos singing along to his music. “I thought we were going to get maybe 30 auditions, but we had 1,000 video submissions by the end of the month,” he said. Fans have also created their own animations to bring Epic’s songs to life and Rivera-Herrans relishes their interactions. “If I tried dropping a hint of something happening in an earlier song – I do a lot of clues through musical motifs – will people pick up on it? When they do, it’s so rewarding.” Perhaps the most obscure leitmotif spotted by fans is a trumpet melody that signals Poseidon is responsible for the storm that keeps Odysseus and his crew at sea for years, without the god appearing in the scene. It’s only later on that the theme returns, sung by the god. “It’s so awesome that people were able to [work it out],” Rivera-Herrans said. “We’re figuring out cool ways of doing storytelling as we do this, and it’s so exciting.” Fan participation in musical theatre has been growing since composers began sharing work on YouTube in about 2015, according to Clare Chandler, a senior lecturer in musical theatre at University of Lincoln’s school of creative arts. Be More Chill, a show about an awkward high school student trying to become cool, originally produced at a theatre in New Jersey, became a minor hit when the cast album was picked up by Spotify’s algorithm. After gaining momentum online, it sold out off-Broadway, where people came “from across the world to see” it, Chandler said, and then it moved to Broadway. “[It] goes from something that was disregarded, through this virtual Broadway environment to be something that becomes staged on Broadway because of its popularity.” The pandemic fuelled the rise of two other TikTok musicals. First came Ratatouille, which emerged from the online meme culture that had grown around the Pixar movie. A variety of TikTok users composed songs and the Ratatousical ended up on Broadway for a one-off charity show. Then Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear created the Unofficial Bridgerton Musical after Barlow posted a video of her singing a fragment of a verse. They won a Grammy for best musical theatre album, but attempts to actually stage the show prompted a lawsuit from Netflix. The question Epic fans have been asking all along is whether they will get to see it on stage. After the final saga drops on Christmas Day, when Odysseus finally arrives in Ithaca, they may get the answer. Rivera-Herrans and his team are in talks with what they describe as a “very high- level company” to make an animated movie, and with another to create a live action stage show. Three video games are planned, with two already on the way. And the team is conscious that fans will want to be involved in the process of bringing these things to life. “What is the next version of Epic that we put out into the world? I’m so open for all of the options, because in each different version we can convey different aspects of the story,” Rivera-Herrans said."
"The New York police department (NYPD) announced it will begin using drones to respond to reports of robberies and alerts from a city-wide gunshot detection system. The drones will fly to the scene, piloted by an NYPD officer, and record video and audio that will be sent to police officers’ smartphones in real time, according to a press release. The integration of these two surveillance technologies is part of a broader “Drone as First Responder” program that has existed since 2018. The New York city mayor, Eric Adams, and the city’s interim police commissioner, Tom Donlan, announced the expansion on Wednesday afternoon. It will be initially rolled out to five precincts in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan. The drones will also be used to collect evidence for investigations, aid in searches for missing people and respond to natural disasters, according to the announcement. “New York City is flying into the future as we keep New Yorkers safe,” said Adams at a press conference on Wednesday. “These drones will mean more efficient policing and will help increase the safety of our responding NYPD officers and New Yorkers.” The expansion of the NYPD’s drone program will combine flying cameras with a gun-shot detection technology, Shotspotter, that the city’s own audit has concluded is overwhelmingly inaccurate. The NYPD’s use of both technologies has long been the subject of concern for civil liberty and privacy experts. Police data shows that the department’s use of drones had more than tripled between 2022 and 2023. Experts argue officers’ use of the technologies has violated the privacy and first amendment rights of Black and brown New York City residents. In 2023, the department used drones to monitor people in their own Brooklyn backyards while they celebrated J’ouvert, a Caribbean festival commemorating the end of slavery. The same year, the department also used drones to surveil pro-Palestinian protests in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The footage captured was used as evidence to charge nearly 160 people, according to Gothamist. Wednesday’s announcement specifically mentions the use of first-responder drones to get “aerial views” to “measure crowd size”. In the case of Shotspotter, civil liberties experts point to the deficiencies of the technology. The city’s own audit found that in 2022, the gunshot detection technology failed to alert police to 200 confirmed gunshots. In addition, the technology has also had a high false positive rate. Only 20% of alerts received over the course of several months between 2022 and 2023 were confirmed gunshots. The accuracy rate dropped in June 2023, when only 13% of 940 alerts received were actual gunshots. “These drones would be disturbing enough on their own, but pairing them with a discredited vendor like ShotSpotter is even worse,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of non-profit advocacy group Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “Recent reviews have found that the vast majority of ShotSpotter alerts are wild goose chases, sending the NYPD to the scenes of crimes that never happened. Sending robots chasing after phantom gunshots that are actually fireworks and car backfires is a privacy nightmare.” The NYPD has previously defended its use of Shotspotter, despite its rate of inaccuracy, saying it is only one of the tools they use to address crime. Shotspotter, which has rebranded to SoundThinking, has long courted police departments across the country, pitching its microphone technology as a means to deter gun violence. As federal grants have dried up and some of these contracts have expired, though, many cities and jurisdictions across the country have been rethinking their use of Shotspotter. The Durham city council in North Carolina voted not to renew its contract with the company, citing concerns that the technology disproportionately sent police to Black and brown neighborhoods. Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, announced he would cancel the city’s Shotspotter contract in February for the same reason. In places where contracts have been renewed, such as Minneapolis, city legislators have been more frequently including clauses that would require an independent audit of the efficacy of the technology."
"Staff at the UK’s national institute for artificial intelligence have warned that its credibility is in “serious jeopardy” and raised doubts over the organisation’s future amid senior departures and a cost-cutting programme. More than 90 staff at the government-backed Alan Turing Institute have written to its board of trustees expressing concerns about its leadership. The letter warns that a redundancy programme, which could affect about 140 of ATI’s 440 staff, has put the institute’s credibility at risk. “With programmes and their teams all slated ‘at risk’ of redundancy, the future of the Turing’s ability to be a serious scientific organisation is now in serious jeopardy,” the letter reads. The staff members warned that ATI was being left behind as the technology, epitomised by the ChatGPT chatbot, developed rapidly. “Both the community and cutting-edge has moved ahead without us, whilst we are publicly and privately criticised for being behind the curve,” the letter adds. The letter also claims that recent employee departures have damaged ATI’s ability to “deliver against existing contractual commitments”, without naming partnerships that might be at risk. Claiming that “numerous” grant awards have fallen through recently due to concerns about ATI’s performance, it adds: “If these failures continue, the institute’s financial viability and ability to secure future funding will be severely compromised.” ATI confirmed to the Guardian that two out of four recently appointed directors of science and innovation have left the institute since their appointment in February. The letter asks the board of trustees, which is chaired by Douglas Gurr, the director of the Natural History Museum, to intervene and hold ATI’s leadership “accountable” for failing to properly implement a newly established strategy for the institute. It adds that if the board does not act, the institute “risks a very serious and public failure”. The institute, named after the British mathematician widely considered the father of modern computing, was founded in 2015 as a national institute for data science before adding AI to its remit in 2017. Its goals include to “advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well as driving an “informed public conversation” on AI, a subject that has climbed up the political agenda following recent breakthroughs including ChatGPT. Its five founding universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, UCL and Warwick. A spokesperson for ATI, which is a registered charity and governed by a board of trustees, said the institute had recently secured £100m from the government in a five-year funding deal and said the board was “actively supporting the leadership team” as it implemented a new strategy. The strategy, dubbed “Turing 2.0”, focuses on three key areas: health, the environment, and defence and security. The spokesperson added that the institute’s work was having a “real-world impact” including developing methodology for assessing the human rights risk associated with AI and working with the Met Office to improve weather forecasting. Jean Innes, ATI’s chief executive, said: “We are shaping a new phase for the Turing in line with an ambitious strategy set by our board and endorsed by our core funder. This will see us collaborating with partners across the ecosystem to use data science and AI to deliver real-world impact on issues like climate and environmental change, improving health and protecting people from defence and security threats.”"
"Picture, if you will, the scene in Mar-a-Lago on election night at the moment when it’s become clear that Trump has won. The atmosphere is hysterical. Trump is in expansive form. He stands surrounded by his ghastly tribe of dependants, plus AN Other. In his victory speech, the president-elect praises his campaign staff, his prospective vice-president, and his family. Each gets a few seconds of adulation. But AN Other gets a whole four minutes. He is Elon Musk, the richest manchild in history. Trump calls him a “super genius”, a “special guy” and a “star”. He has flown straight from Texas in his Gulfstream to bask in the adulation of his new lord and master. He has also paid several hundred million dollars, plus a month of his time, to be here. But now his time has come. Hold that thought. We will return to it later. Now imagine what Musk’s peers in Silicon Valley were thinking, as they sat chewing their pencils composing slavish messages of congratulation to The Donald. And believe me, they were toe-curlingly obsequious. All around the valley, though, the prevailing sound was of teeth being gnashed. After all, most of these tech titans had spent months wondering how to curry favour with Trump in case he actually won. And there was Musk, who had done an end-run around them and inserted himself into the heart of the new administration. It must have been maddening. Spool forward a few days and we find that it gets worse: Trump has chosen Musk and a wannabe titan, Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead a “department of government efficiency” (or “Doge”, after Musk’s favourite cryptocurrency, Dogecoin), thereby putting the two dudes in charge of a concerted effort to slash rules, bureaucracy and spending throughout the federal government. “Together, these two wonderful Americans,” declared their new boss, “will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.” Presumably he was impressed by Musk’s claim that he could cut at least $2 trillion from the government’s $6.8tn budget, and by Ramaswamy’s promise, made during his failed campaign for the Republican nomination, to eliminate the FBI, the Department of Education and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Although this new outfit is called a “department”, it won’t actually be a government agency. If it were, Musk would have innumerable conflicts of interest that would cause legal difficulties if he started slashing the regulators with which he is currently in conflict. These include the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Also, last year his various companies had $3bn worth of government contracts from 17 federal agencies. But if he’s “outside” the system, he’ll be freer to slash and burn as he likes. In 2018, the writer Michael Lewis published The Fifth Risk, a remarkable book examining the implications of Trump’s political appointments in his first term, especially with respect to three government agencies: the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce. The book, Lewis explained, was a product of his own desire to find out what branches of the government that never make the headlines actually do. And he found that what they do largely involves keeping people and society safe. If Musk’s past behaviour is anything to go by, such concern with safety will cut little ice. After he had been forced by a Delaware court to proceed with his purchase of Twitter, the first thing he did was to fire 6,500 people – about 80% of the staff, by his own reckoning. And those dismissed included people whose job was to moderate content on the platform and keep it relatively “safe”. After they’d gone, the platform was opened to all-comers, which is why it has degenerated into a toxic sewer of anti-woke fanatics, white supremacists, misogynists, conspiracy theorists and other inhabitants of alternative universes. He also tweaked the platform’s algorithms to prioritise his own posts to its 200 million users, thus in effect giving him a broadcast medium for his political views and preferences. Musk’s strategy, once he decided to back Trump, was to go all-in, much as he did years ago when the production of the Tesla Model 3 was running into trouble and he claimed to have slept in the factory for weeks. He moved to Pennsylvania for the last month of the campaign and was active on the ground every day, energising campaigners and generally raising the campaign’s profile, especially in rural areas. In other words, he made himself indispensable to Trump, and therein lies what may come to be his problem. Narcissists do not like to be under an obligation to anyone, no matter how useful they have been. Thomas Cromwell made himself indispensable to Henry VIII in the 1530s and – as viewers of Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light are soon to discover – ultimately that was not a great career move. History may not repeat itself, but this time, as Mark Twain is supposed to have said, it might just rhyme. What I’ve been reading The narrow path from despair Diane Coyle’s beautifully succinct review on Enlightenment Economics of Sam Freedman’s book Failed State: Why Nothing Works and How We Fix It. Congratulations, boss The Verge’s compilation of all the nauseatingly obsequious messages sent by tech titans to the president-elect.

"Elon Musk has emerged as the sole financial architect behind a provocative political action committee that appropriated the name of late US supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to bolster Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, according to federal campaign finance reports released on Thursday. The RBG Pac, funded entirely by the world’s richest man with a $20.5m donation in the final two weeks of the campaign, ran advertisements and mailers suggesting an ideological alignment between Trump and Ginsburg on abortion. That’s a narrative that Clara Spera, the justice’s granddaughter, denounced as fundamentally misleading. “The use of her name and image to support Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, and specifically to suggest that she would approve of his position on abortion, is nothing short of appalling,” she told the New York Times in October. The RBG Pac’s strategic advertising push arrived at a critical political moment, following months of Democratic attacks on Trump’s abortion stance. Its website featured a photo of Trump and Ginsburg with the caption “Great Minds Think Alike” – a claim that directly contradicts Ginsburg’s well-documented judicial philosophy and her personal opposition to Trump. “Why did Ruth Bader Ginsburg agree with Donald Trump’s position on abortion?” the website asked. “Because RBG believed that the federal government shouldn’t dictate our abortion laws.” The Pac claimed that Trump doesn’t support a federal abortion ban – something Trump himself said on the campaign trail – although he will face pressure from Republicans and opponents of abortion to enact one once he takes office anyway. Spera has shared in the past that Ginsburg’s dying wish in September 2020 had been that she was not replaced on the court until a new president was sworn in. That request was ignored by Trump when he appointed Amy Coney Barrett, who would later be part of the conservative majority overturning Roe v Wade. Musk’s political spending far exceeded this single Pac, ballooning to more than $260m in the 2024 election cycle. His primary vehicle was America Pac, which raised about $252m, with Musk making high-profile campaign appearances and conducting voter outreach initiatives that included controversial $1m giveaways in swing states. The billionaire’s political donations also extended to a $3m contribution to a Super Pac linked to Robert F Kennedy Jr and nearly $1m directly to Trump’s campaign committee. Now with the Trump win, Musk is positioned to play a significant role in the incoming administration. He’s set to co-lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside biotech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, pledging to dramatically reduce federal bureaucracy."
"When James Irungu took on a new job for the tech outsourcing company Samasource, his manager provided scant details before his training began. But the role was highly sought after and would nearly double his pay to £250 a month. Plus it offered a path out of Kibera, the vast shantytown on the outskirts of Nairobi where he lived with his young family. “I thought I was one of the lucky ones,” the 26-year-old, said. But then he found himself ploughing through heaps of violent and sexually explicit material, including grisly accidents, suicides, beheadings and child abuse. “I remember one day when I logged in to see a child with their stomach torn wide open, suffering but not dead,” the Kenyan national told the Guardian. It was seeing child exploitation material “when it really kicked in that this was something different”. He had been hired by Samasource to moderate Facebook content, weeding out the most toxic posts. Some of the most tormenting images remained etched in his mind, occasionally jolting him awake in night sweats. Fearing that opening up about his work would evoke discomfort, concern or judgment from others, he kept it to himself. Exasperated by his “secretiveness”, his wife grew distant. Irungu resigned himself to them drifting apart, convinced he was protecting her and stayed in the job for three years. He says he regrets pressing on. “I don’t think that work is suitable for human beings,” he said. “It really isolated me from the real world because I started to see it as such a dark place.” He became afraid to let his daughter out of his sight. “When I ask myself if the money was really worth sacrificing my mental health for, the answer is no.” Another former moderator said she was alarmed at some of the content and some fellow workers dropped out. But she found purpose in assurances from her managers that their work protected users, including young children like hers. “I felt like I was helping people,” she said. But when she stopped, she realised that things she had normalised were troubling. She remembered once screaming in the middle of the office floor after watching one horrific scene. Except for a few glances from co-workers, and a team leader pulling her aside to “go to wellness” counselling, it was like nothing had happened, she said. The wellness counsellors told her to take some time to rest and get the image out of her head. “How do you forget when you’re back on the floor after a 15-minute break, to move to the next thing?” she said. She wondered if the counsellors were qualified psychotherapists, saying that they would never escalate a case for mental healthcare no matter what the moderators had seen or how distressed they were. She went from being the kind of person who would host friends at every occasion to barely leaving her house, crying at the deaths of people she did not know to feeling numb and mentally troubled, sometimes battling suicidal thoughts. “The work damaged me, I could never go back to it,” said the woman , who hopes that the case will have impacts on the content moderation industry in Africa, as global demand for such services grows. “Things have to change,” she said. “I would never want anyone to go through what we did.”"
"With reference to your report on the COP25 climate talks in Madrid (13 December), we have just returned from Madrid, where we displayed a large banner saying “War causes climate change and climate change causes war”. Thousands of passing delegates expressed a great interest in, and approval of, the message. Scientists for Global Responsibility estimates that 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions result from military-related activity – apart from the unfathomable human devastation – so at first sight it appears astonishing that the subject of war does not feature in the COP negotiations; nor are its emissions taken into account when reduction targets are set. Perhaps this absence can be explained by the fact that military-related emissions have been excluded by some of the largest polluters from the global north whose delegates, as government officials, will naturally avoid jeopardising lucrative arms and military aid contracts, and whose people do not suffer the catastrophic wars and climatic devastation that directly affect the global south. Evidently we cannot rely on government negotiators to address the subject of war and militarism. We have to stop believing that war is inevitable and accept that international climate finance offers better value in both resolving conflict and sustaining the environment than the equivalent spent on military operations. Hilary Evans Movement for the Abolition of War David Collins Veterans for Peace UK • I was delighted to see Greta Thunberg announced as Time magazine’s person of the year (Report, 12 December). For me, after so many years of campaigning on environmental issues, it has been a huge relief that now, in 2019, the future of the planet has finally entered the political mainstream – and not a moment too soon. This is thanks, in no small part, to the vision and actions of Greta herself, but also to those many others whom she has inspired to take up the fight. The world is realising the scale of the threat posed by every aspect of our destructive exploitation of our lovely planet.

Catherine Rowett Green party MEP, East of England • I’m writing in reference to your use of the term “global heating”. I understand the motivation is probably to draw attention to the fact that we are actively changing the climate, a laudable goal. However, the term should be used correctly. In an article about the disappointing results of the COP25 climate negotiations (Discord at climate talks branded a betrayal, 16 December) it was noted that: “Experts say more ambitious emissions cuts are needed globally if the Paris pledge to hold global heating to no more than 2C is to be met.” However, heating involves a change in energy and is measured in joules. Warming, on the other hand, is a change in temperature and is measured in degrees celsius. So “global warming” would have been more apt here.

"Microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with research revealing that London has the highest levels yet recorded. The health impacts of breathing or consuming the tiny plastic particles are unknown, and experts say urgent research is needed to assess the risks. Only four cities have been assessed to date but all had microplastic pollution in the air. Scientists believe every city will be contaminated, as sources of microplastic such as clothing and packaging are found everywhere. Recent research shows the whole planet appears to be contaminated with microplastic pollution. Scientists have found the particles everywhere they look, from Arctic snow and mountain soils, to many rivers and the deepest oceans. Other work indicates particles can be blown across the world. The level of microplastic discovered in the London air surprised scientists. “We found a high abundance of microplastics, much higher than what has previously been reported,” said Stephanie Wrightfrom Kings College London, who led the research. “But any city around the world is going to be somewhat similar.” “I find it of concern – that is why I am working on it,” she said. “The biggest concern is we don’t really know much at all. I want to find out if it is safe or not.” About 335m tonnes of new plastic is produced each year and much leaks into the environment. The research, published in the journal Environment International, collected the microplastics falling onto the roof of a nine-storey building in central London. This ensured that only microplastic from the atmosphere was collected. They were found in all eight samples, with deposition rates ranging from 575 to 1,008 pieces per sq metre per day, and 15 different plastics were identified. Most microplastics were fibres made of acrylic, most likely from clothing. Just 8% of the microplastics were particles, and these were mostly polystyrene and polyethylene, both commonly used in food packaging. The rate of microplastic deposition measured in London is 20 times higher than in Dongguan, China, seven times higher than in Paris, France and nearly three times higher than Hamburg, Germany. The researchers do not know the reason for the variation, but differences in experimental methods are likely to be partly responsible. The microplastic particles in London were between 0.02mm and 0.5mm. These are large enough to be deposited on to the airways when inhaled and would be swallowed in saliva. Smaller particles that can get into the lungs and bloodstream represent the greatest potential health hazard. These were seen in the samples but their composition could not be identified with current technology. The serious health damage caused by the pollution particles emitted by traffic and industry are well known. A comprehensive global review earlier in 2019 concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. But the potential health impacts of inhaling plastic particles from the air, or consuming them via food and water, are unknown. People eat at least 50,000 microplastic particles per year, according to one study. Plastics can carry toxic chemicals and harbour harmful microbes, and the limited research done to date has shown harm to some marine creatures. The only assessment of microplastic in human lungs, published in 1998, found inhaled fibres were present in cancerous lung specimens. “These studies showing just how much plastic is in the air are a wake-up call,” said Steve Allen, at the EcoLab research institute near Toulouse, France, and whose own work has shown microplastic air pollution in remote mountain areas. “The [London research] is a very well done study showing incredibly high numbers of airborne microplastics. “Currently we have very little knowledge on what effect this airborne pollution will have on humans,” he said. “But with what we do know it is pretty scary to think we are breathing it in. We need urgent research.” Johnny Gasperi, at the Université Paris-Est, said the research shows a widespread contamination of the air by microplastics. He said the London study showed that microplastic deposition did not depend on the strength or direction of the wind, suggesting the city itself was the most likely source. Melanie Bergmann, at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, said more research on the potential health effects of microplastic pollution was very important. “We do not currently know what proportion of inhaled microplastics actually penetrates the deep lung,” she said. The European commission’s chief scientific advisers said in a report in April: “The evidence [on the environmental and health risks of microplastics] provides grounds for genuine concern and for precaution to be exercised.” Microplastics are also found in drinking water and in August an assessment by the World Health Organization found no evidence to date of harm but said more research was needed. Cutting microplastic pollution requires changing how plastic is used and disposed of, said Wright: “You can’t clean it up, so it is about stopping it at source.” Allen said: “This is not a problem that is going to go away anytime soon.”"
"The proportion of the UK’s power generation mix made up by fossil fuels has fallen to a record low after renewable energy became the UK’s largest source of electricity. Government figures showed the UK relied on renewables, such as wind and solar, for 38.9% of its electricity in the third quarter of this year, up from one-third in the same period in 2018. Renewable energy moved narrowly ahead of gas-fired power, which made up 38.8% of the electricity mix, to emerge as the UK’s biggest source of power. The rise of renewables combined with output from nuclear power plants pushed fossil fuels to their lowest share of the UK’s energy mix on record, according to the official data. The dwindling number of coal-fired power stations contributed 1% of the UK’s electricity in the third quarter, down from 2.5% in the same period in 2018. This was in part due to the earlier-than-expected end of generation at Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire, which burned through its remaining coal stocks before the official 30 September finish date. Another two coal plants, Aberthaw B and Fiddler’s Ferry, are due to close in March, leaving four coal-fired power stations in the UK. The report also said the UK’s growing fleet of offshore wind projects generated more electricity than onshore windfarms for the first time. The giant turbines off the coast generated 9.8% of the UK’s electricity, up from 6.7% in 2018. Onshore windfarms lagged slightly behind, generating 9.2% of the UK’s electricity in the third quarter, up from 7.3% in the same period last year. Since the record-breaking quarter, wind power reached fresh highs earlier this month to generate almost 45% of the UK’s electricity on one day, and an all-time high of 16GW overnight. The wind power highs meant thousands of homes were paid to plug in their electric vehicles overnight and set their dishwashers on timers for the early hours of the morning to make use of the extra energy."
"It might seem like they are being lazy but some moths do not bother to flee from predators because they make themselves taste disgusting. That is the case for a certain species of tiger moth, which researchers have found displays a nonchalant approach when faced with potential predators, on account of its disgusting flavour. Dr Nicolas Dowdy, of the Milwaukee Public Museum and Wake Forest University in the US, found certain members of the Tiger moth family do not duck and dive from predatory bats with the same vigour as their counterparts. A study published in the Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution journal suggested this approach can pay dividends for winged insects, which have evolved a special chemical defence that makes them less palatable. Dowdy came to this conclusion after an experiment in which he released five species of tiger moth into an outdoor flight arena at night, where wild bats would frequently swoop in to feed. Using infrared cameras, he monitored interactions between the bats and moths, and recorded how often different species displayed evasive or nonchalant behaviour during a bat attack. Dowdy said: “Strikingly, we observed that moths with weak or no chemical defences often dive away to escape bat attacks. However, moths with more potent chemical defences are more ‘nonchalant’, performing evasive manoeuvres less often.” When considering why the insects did not just try to evade the bats anyway, researchers suggested that the method posed risks as well as rewards. Performing panicked evasive manoeuvres might help a moth avoid becoming dinner but it might also land it in a spider’s web or away from a food source or mate. Dowdy speculated that unsavoury moths may often take the lazier and potentially safer option by relying on their chemical defences, rather than roll the dice on an emergency flight. Many creatures in the animal kingdom have evolved defence tactics to evade and deter predators. Ultrasonic hearing and mid-flight swoops and dives are some of the other tactics within the moth’s arsenal. It may be possible that this relationship between palatability and nonchalance exists elsewhere in the animal kingdom but future studies are needed, said the researchers."
"People living with air pollution have higher rates of depression and suicide, a systematic review of global data has found. Cutting air pollution around the world to the EU’s legal limit could prevent millions of people becoming depressed, the research suggests. This assumes that exposure to toxic air is causing these cases of depression. Scientists believe this is likely but is difficult to prove beyond doubt. The particle pollution analysed in the study is produced by burning fossil fuels in vehicles, homes and industry. The researchers said the new evidence further strengthened calls to tackle what the World Health Organization calls the “silent public health emergency” of dirty air. “We’ve shown that air pollution could be causing substantial harm to our mental health, making the case for cleaning up the air we breathe even more urgent,” said Isobel Braithwaite, at University College London (UCL), who led the research. Meeting the EU limit could make a big difference, she said. “You could prevent about 15% of depression, assuming there is a causal relationship. It would be a very large impact, because depression is a very common disease and is increasing.” More than 264 million people have depression, according to the WHO. “We know that the finest particulates from dirty air can reach the brain via both the bloodstream and the nose, and that air pollution has been implicated in increased [brain] inflammation, damage to nerve cells and to changes in stress hormone production, which have been linked to poor mental health,” Braithwaite said. Joseph Hayes, also at UCL and part of the research team, said: “The evidence is highly suggestive that air pollution itself increases the risk of adverse mental health outcomes.” The research, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, used strict quality criteria to select and pool research data from 16 countries published up to 2017. This revealed a strong statistical link between toxic air and depression and suicide. This is supported by more recent research, including studies that linked air pollution with “extremely high mortality” in people with mental disorders and a quadrupled risk of depression in teenagers. Other research indicates that air pollution causes a “huge” reduction in intelligence and is linked to dementia. A comprehensive global review earlier in 2019 concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. The data analysed in the new research linked depression with air pollution particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres (equivalent to 0.0025 millimetres and known as PM2.5). People exposed to an increase of 10 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) in the level of PM2.5 for a year or more had a 10% higher risk of getting depression. Levels of PM2.5 in cities range from as high as 114µg/m3 in Delhi, India, to just 6µg/m3 in Ottawa, Canada. In UK cities in 2017, the average PM2.5 level was 13µg/m3. The researchers estimated that lowering this to the WHO recommended limit of 10µg/m3 could reduce depression in city dwellers by about 2.5%. The available data on suicide risk was for particles ranging up to 10 micrometres (PM10). The researchers found a short-term effect, with a 10µg/m3 increase over three days raising the risk of suicide by 2%. Scientists say small increases in risk can still result in harm to many people because more than 90% of the global population lives with air pollution above WHO-recommended levels. “This is something everyone is exposed to, so at the population level it is potentially concerning,” said Braithwaite. The results show strong correlations, but research that would prove a causal link is difficult because ethical experiments cannot deliberately expose people to harm. The studies analysed took account of many factors that might affect mental health, including home location, income, education, smoking, employment and obesity. But they were not able to separate the potential impact of noise, which often occurs alongside air pollution and is known to have psychological effects. “This is a comprehensive review over a 40-year period,” said Ioannis Bakolis, at King’s College London, not part of the research team. “Although the studies included were from different parts of the world – eg China, the US, Germany – and varied in sample size, study design and measures of depression, the reported associations were very similar.” But he said the evidence remained limited and more research was needed. In particular, understanding the impact of pollution reduction on mental health would give policymakers further evidence of the benefits of action. “We all need to do what we can to reduce our own contribution to air pollution, whether that is walking or cycling,” said Braithwaite. “But we also need to be thinking about system change, meaning [government] policies that help reduce overall air pollution levels.” The researchers said walking, cycling and more green spaces not only cut air pollution but also improved mental health.

"Spanish energy giant Iberdrola says it has decided to invest $500m in a wind and solar farm in South Australia as the first of a series of renewable power projects it hopes to develop in Australia. Iberdrola’s head of renewables, Xabier Viteri, said that in the new year the company would also probably increase its target for renewable energy from the “ambitious” target of 10GW by 2022. “Our ambition is going to be a little bit higher,” he told Guardian Australia. Viteri seemed unworried by the hostility expressed towards renewables by some parts of the Morrison government. “All of us can work together and there’s not going to be any problem.” Viteri said Australia was an ideal place to invest because of its high power consumption and stable market. “It’s a place where renewables are going to play a much more relevant position in the coming years, clearly,” he said. “It’s a bit far away from where I am now, that’s the only problem.” The project, the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park, has been under development by the privately owned DP Energy. DP Energy’s country manager for Australia, Catherine Way, said the project was now “shovel ready”. She said DP Energy would assist in building the plant but it would ultimately be owned and operated by Iberdrola. The plant is to be made up of a 210MW windfarm, designed to peak at the same time as demand at about 6pm to 7pm every day, plus photovoltaic solar to provide electricity during the day. It will feed directly into the South Australian power grid, but Way said direct sales to industrial customers were also possible. She said demand from business customers was based on both a desire to decarbonise their operations and economics. “Renewable energy electrons are typically cheaper than electrons where you have to pay for the fuel,” she said. Iberdrola’s country manager for Australia, Fernando Santamaria, said construction would start next year and the plant should be complete by the second half of 2021. “The combination of those technologies, it’s a trend we are seeing globally,” he said. “The wind profile matches very well the South Australian demand, and the solar provides the perfect complement. “I think corporate, big customers, are becoming more and more interested in decarbonisation, getting cleaner sources of energy for their projects, for their consumption.” He said future investments would likely be in the areas serviced by the National Electricity Market, which excludes Western Australia, especially the east coast. But he declined to identify where Iberdrola would go next. “We already have some focus and some ideas,” he said."
"When Ilene Dondlinger jumped on the mountain lion attacking her miniature schnauzer in the early hours of 5 December, she reacted without thinking. The 54-year-old wrestled with the big cat in her backyard, desperately trying to open its jaws to save her beloved dog Pumba. But there was nothing she could do. “I couldn’t prise its jaws open, no matter what I did,” Dondlinger said, detailing how she punched, kicked and jumped on the big cat, even putting her knee to its throat in desperation. “I don’t have any children so he was my baby. But I couldn’t get him out … I knew when my little dog was gone.” Dondlinger was left with bruises after the struggle. She said the mountain lion had barely reacted to her retaliation, only growling at her once Pumba was dead. Mountain lions, known as pumas, panthers, cougars or brown tigers depending where you are in the western hemisphere, live across California. A typical adult male weighs 110lb to 180lb and a female 80lb to 130lb, according to the Mountain Lion Foundation. They are rarely dangerous to humans but attacks on pets and livestock do happen. An animal known to researchers as Puma-35 is believed to have carried out the attack. It inhabits the Simi Hills where Dondlinger lives, about 40 miles from Los Angeles. When the big cat became aggressive in the tussle, Dondlinger had to retreat indoors for her own safety. Police officers responding to the call were met with a grisly sight of P-35 eating the dog when they peered through a window into the backyard. But despite Dondlinger’s grief for a dog that had spent more than a decade by her side, she does not want P-35 killed. “It won’t bring Pumba back,” she said. “Us humans continue to push them out of their space, continuing to build houses in their territory. They have a right to be here, too. I don’t ever want anybody to go through what I’ve been through because it was the most horrific five minutes of my life … But if humans keep killing everything off, eventually there won’t be any wildlife left.” A study in March found that urbanisation is threatening mountain lions with local extinction in southern California within 50 years, largely from inbreeding caused by the state’s road network, which traps subpopulations of the big cat on genetic islands. Cars, rodenticides and depredation orders also threaten them. Conservationists are planning to build the largest wildlife crossing in the world to help the predator’s survival in and around California. It was not the first time the big cat, nicknamed Santa Susana Mountains Mom by researchers after giving birth to many litters of kittens, is believed have preyed on a pet in the neighbourhood that evening. Around 10pm, police were called to a nearby property in Evening Sky Drive after another resident complained a mountain lion had attacked his dog while he was walking near his home. Around 1am, the same resident called again as the mountain lion was on his front porch, staring in through a window at his dog. Later that evening, Dondlinger let Pumba out to relieve himself just after 2am and he chased the mountain lion in her backyard, only for the mountain lion to grab the dog. The big cat left Pumba’s body when police arrived and he has since been cremated. Minnesota-born Dondlinger said she thought the big cat was sick and that might have been why it came down from the hills. “If it had been a healthy cat, you probably wouldn’t have been talking to me right now. It was skin and bones. Its hair was really, really gross and it had the most putrid smell,” she explained. Dondlinger said the big cat barely responded to her desperate efforts to save her dog. Researchers said they would need to capture the mountain lion to check its health and verify its identity. On Thursday morning, a male mountain lion was caught and tranquilized in a backyard in Simi Hills. But P-35 has not been captured by authorities. Some of the media reaction to the incident has been frenzied, warning of more attacks as a dangerous cougar stalks the neighbourhood. The concern has divided some residents in the area but authorities have clear rules about such incidents. Cmdr Steve Shorts from the Simi Valley police department told the Guardian: “If there’s not a public safety risk where that animal is going to injure or seriously harm a person, we are not allowed to use deadly force on that animal. It has to be justified. If it’s eating a domestic animal, the dog that is unfortunately attacked, that’s considered property, that’s not a person.” The Mountain Lion Foundation advise people living alongside wild animals to keep pets inside at night if coyotes and mountain lions live in the area, put up fences, install frighten devices and discourage deer from entering property. The California department of fish and wildlife has advised people to avoid hiking at dawn and dusk, keep dogs on leashes in mountain lion territory, never run and fight back if attacked. But attacks on humans are very rare, fewer than 20 in the last 100 years, and most mountain lions avoid human settlements. Asked about P-35’s future, Shorts said: “Hopefully what’s going to happen is that this is just a small area in that mountain lion’s range and it’s just decided to hang out in this area right now and it’s going to go into another area that’s more secluded. Hopefully then it will stop.”"
"“On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me…” I bet you’re already singing the next line: “a partridge in a pear tree!” The Twelve Days of Christmas is one of our best-known Christmas carols, even if its repetitive format does sometimes drive us round the bend. But what of the partridge itself? When I was growing up on the edge of London, the grey partridge was, if not exactly common, a fairly regular sight. If I took a trip to East Anglia, they were ten a penny. Nowadays, I struggle to find them anywhere. That’s because this classic farmland bird has declined by over 90% in the past 50 years: down from half a million pairs to fewer than 50,000. As with another species we sing about in the carol – the turtle dove – it’s the usual story. Our demand for cheap food, leading to more intensive farming, simply doesn’t allow room for this charismatic gamebird. The image of the largely terrestrial partridge perched in a pear tree has always struck me as odd; and it seems that I was right. The ‘pear tree’ is actually a corruption of the French word for the species – perdrix, pronounced with a silent x, as pair-dree.

"Shipping companies would have to pay a small levy on every tonne of fuel they use under proposals aimed at developing zero-carbon vessels within 10 years, transforming the high-carbon global shipping business. Ships running on hydrogen or ammonia as fuel are thought to be technically possible, but more research and development is needed to bring forward the development of prototypes. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), which represents 80% of the global shipping industry, is proposing a $2 levy on every tonne of fuel consumed by ships, raising $500m a year that would be devoted to research and development of zero-carbon vessels. “This is a very positive proposal,” said Guy Platten, the secretary general of the ICS. “We need to get to zero carbon [for shipping] and this is a transparent mechanism for raising funds that we need to help us do that. We have worked for years on this with the support of our members.” Fuel costs about $400 a tonne at present, set to rise to an estimated $600 next year following the introduction of new regulations on cutting sulphur emissions from ship oil. The $2 levy is small in comparison, and Platten said it was kept low so that developing countries would see it as affordable, but it would still raise enough to fund the development of a new generation of ships in a decade or so. Simon Bennett, the ICS’s deputy secretary general, said shipowners could foresee that they would be pressed to further cut greenhouse gases, and that without a coherent plan to move to zero emissions in the next few decades it was likely that “something far worse” could be imposed. That could feasibly include rationing emissions for maritime transport in the next 20 to 30 years. Bennett said it was vital the levy plan was a mandatory, rather than voluntary, initiative. Some campaigners were cautious about the proposal, which will not produce concrete reductions in emissions in the short term. Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: “The shipping industry has slipped under the radar of international climate action for way too long. Investing research to create zero-carbon ships is not a bad thing in itself, but it becomes suspiciously close to a delaying tactic if it is not accompanied by clear reduction targets. If the shipping industry wants people to believe this is a serious move, then they should change course and support legally binding targets to cut their planet-warming emissions.” Nico Muzi, the director of communications and campaigns at Transport &amp; Environment, said: “That amount is simply ridiculous to spur innovation in the sector nor to be a driver to spur efficiency. If it is $2 per tonne of fuel, it is 42 times less than current CO2 prices in Europe. To rein in long-ignored maritime emissions and make shipping do its fair share, Europe must bring shipping into its carbon market and mandate CO2 standards for all ships calling at its ports.” Shipping accounts for about 2% of global greenhouse gases, and the share is likely grow further as trade increases and other sectors, such as electricity generation and land transport, reduce carbon. Despite the size of the sector, progress on cutting emissions has so far been slow. Shipping and aviation have been omitted from global climate talks and commitments on cutting carbon for the last two decades, and national commitments under the 2015 Paris agreement do not include the international transport sectors. Action from within the shipping sector has also been slow. The International Maritime Organisation is seeking to halve shipping emissions by 2050, a mammoth task as emissions have continued to rise while the issue was ignored, while countries including the UK are seeking net-zero emissions by the same deadline. Shipping fuel is particularly carbon-intensive, as ships use heavy fuel oil that is dirty and high in contaminants as well as carbon. Sulphur from shipping is also a problem, and subject to separate regulations. The ICS put forward its paper to the International Maritime Organisation on Wednesday, with a view to incorporation into maritime regulations within a few years. The paper will be introduced at a key IMO meeting next March, then discussed again through the year, and if accepted by member states would be added to existing international maritime conventions. Bennett said the shipping industry would be capable of halving emissions by 2050 only if a large proportion of the global fleet was using zero-carbon fuels. He predicted that the rest of the fleet could be converted soon after, bringing the goal of 100% decarbonisation closer. He said the initiative would not affect potential proposals to bring shipping within the scope of the EU’s emissions trading scheme."
"A global assessment of all 826 known species of eucalypt trees – of which some 812 grow only in Australia – has found almost a quarter are threatened with extinction. The figures are revealed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s update of its “red list” of threatened species. Eucalypts in their native range of Australia faced threats from human land use, especially agriculture and urbanisation, the IUCN said. “As keystone species, [eucalypts] define the landscape of the entire Australian continent, and are culturally significant to its First Nations people,” the IUCN said. Some 134 species of eucalypts had drops in numbers of at least 30% and the endangered Rose Mallee had declined by more than half. Eucalyptus trees are the key food source for koalas. Eucalyptus moluccana was also considered a vulnerable under the new assessment, the IUCN said. Dr Eve Lucas, a scientist at the UK’s Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, said: “The completion of the eucalypt assessment is a major milestone for plant conservation: pinpointing and highlighting the hundreds of threatened species in this iconic and ecologically important genus will increase their chances of survival in the face of the uncertain climate of the future. “Global assessments of large genera of plants are challenging collaborative exercises and critically important to improve our understanding of plant extinction risks and the actions needed to mitigate them.” Prof David Bowman, who studies the impacts of climate change and fire on trees at the University of Tasmania, told Guardian Australia that while eucalpyts were ubiquitous in Australia, they were also vulnerable. He said: “I’m not surprised by this assessment. We are talking here about old ecological systems that are being taken to the edge. “Eucalypts are keystone species and are critical to a huge number of of ecological systems. If you start taking them out, then there will be knock on effects because so many organisms – birds and insects – depend on them. There are a lot of warning signs out there, and this is another one.” Dr Stuart Blanch, of WWF-Australia, said: “Deforestation and global heating are threatening the survival of eucalypts across Australia. “It’s not just individual eucalypt species at risk. Entire forest ecosystems dominated by eucalypts are endangered. Some have been cleared down to less than 10% - or even 5% - of their original extent.” He said that Australia only listed 76 eucalypts as threatened, while IUCN listed 198, which suggested “the federal government should urgently re-assess the plight of these iconic trees”. He added: “The bushfires have scorched large areas of eucalypts and we hope those forests are still alive and can sprout new leaves. “There’s hope for eucalypts and other tree species if we take the right action now.”"
"At the start of 2020, Sue Peachey could never have predicted how her life would change over the next 12 months. She was one of 108 people to take part in the UK’s first climate assembly earlier in the year, spending four weekends learning about a range of environmental issues before producing a final report of recommendations. “The first weekend changed me really. I thought, ‘Oh my God, [climate change] is really going to happen,’ she said. “It made me want to learn and to live my life greener.” Her first step was to buy an electric car, something she admits she knew very little about. “The only electric vehicle I was aware of was a milk float,” she laughed. She was frustrated by how difficult it was to find information, even from the car salesman at her local garage who couldn’t answer her questions, but as soon she as she gave the electric vehicle a test drive she was “convinced it was definitely the way forward”. Next was to figure out a way to pass on what she had learned at the assembly, during which participants produced recommendations, including a tax on frequent-flyers, a ban on selling SUVs, and a cut in meat consumption. When she saw some openings for councillors at her parish council in Batheaston, she decided to give it a shot. “I thought I could encourage and support my local community to make some greener choices,” said Peachey, who has already used her role to help declare a climate emergency in the area. “I’m no expert and I probably can’t remember half the things they told me [in the assembly], but all I know is climate change is real, it is going to happen and we all need to make changes to our lives.” She’s not the only participant to have made major life changes after taking part. Linda, 59, who asked that her full name not be used, has decided to set up a sustainable secondhand clothing business after leaving her office job earlier in the year. “I didn’t realise how much fashion contributed to climate change. I think 10% of annual global carbon dioxide emissions are from the fashion industry,” she said. “I thought it was something I could address personally.” She has taken a business course to prepare herself for the venture which she hopes to get off the ground in spring, something she never anticipated earlier in the year. “My family can’t quite believe what I’m going to be doing, but they’re all behind me,” she said. Other participants’ lifestyle changes have not been quite as drastic but have still had a profound impact. Max, 17, the assembly’s youngest member, who also asked for his full name not to be used, became a pescatarian after learning how meat-eating was having a negative effect on the planet – despite the jibes of his school mates. “My friends thought it was stupid at first, but over time they’ve got used to it,” he said. “I just saw how much carbon dioxide was released from each type of meat and I thought, ‘Wow, this is something I need to think about a lot more’.” Charley Winter, 26, from Northamptonshire, works in PR and used to jetset around the world on about six holidays a year to indulge her love of travelling – but when the pandemic is over, she doesn’t plan on going back to normal. “It needs to change. If it does negatively impact me I understand that and I’m willing to make changes in my life for the better,” she said, adding she plans to rethink how many flights she takes and go on more UK-based holidays in the future. Although some participants said it was too early to gauge the impact of the Climate Assembly report, many were pleased with how it had been received by the government and said they felt the recently announced 10-point green plan mirrored some of their suggestions. But all agreed the climate knowledge they gained from the assembly has empowered them to make their own decisions, and stressed the need for better education across the population. “Everybody should receive something in the post from the government informing them of the changes they can make, because a lot of people don’t realise the small things they do make a big difference,” said Linda. In its Sixth Carbon Budget, published earlier this month, the government’s statutory advisers, the Climate Change Committee, said: “The experience of the UK climate assembly shows that if people understand what’s needed and why, if they have options and can be involved in the decision-making process, they will support the transition to net zero.” This is most important for older generations, said Peachey, who would not have been taught about the climate crisis in school. For her, the experience has been more transformative than she ever anticipated. “I’m 57, I probably thought this time last year my days of going to meetings and discussing and debating were over, and here we are a year later, I’ve done the climate assembly and I’m now on the parish council,” she said. “Who knows what’s next? But it’s definitely awakened me.”"
"The impact of the coronavirus lockdown on climate has lowered 2050 temperature projections by a “negligible” 0.01C, the UN has revealed. A green economic recovery from the pandemic could, however, make a substantial difference, according to the UN Environment Programme (Unep) annual emissions gap report, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25% over the next decade and putting the world on track to meeting the Paris agreement’s goal of keeping any temperature rise within 2C of pre-industrial levels. Months of empty roads, empty skies and sluggish economic activity reduced this year’s global greenhouse gas discharges by an estimated 7%, the sharpest annual fall ever recorded. But the temporary decline merely slowed the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere, leaving the world on course for more than 3.2C of warming by the end of this century, even if countries implement their existing commitments under the Paris agreement. “We are going in the wrong direction,” Inger Andersen, executive director of Unep, told the Guardian. “We had lockdown. Some people think that gave us a bonanza. But it doesn’t. Just because you stop running the tap for a moment or two, that doesn’t change the fact that the bathtub is still full.” The emissions gap study calculates the shortfall between national climate targets and the international goal agreed at Paris in 2015 to keep global heating to between 1.5C and 2C. As in the 11 previous editions, this year’s report shows states are far off course. Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, said the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continued to rise despite the lockdown with increasingly evident consequences. “This year has seen record-breaking forest fires in Colorado and California, devastating flooding in China and Vietnam, and all-time-high numbers of tropical storms in the Caribbean,” he said. 2020 is certain to be among the world’s three hottest years since measurements began. The climate disruption is driven by human activity. Greenhouse gas emissions, including land-use change, rose on average by 1.4% a year over the past decade to reach a new high of 59.1 gigatonnes in 2019. The pace dropped this year due to lockdown. Preliminary assessments suggest CO2 emissions could shrink by about 7% in 2020, a far bigger decline than that registered during the last slowdown in 2008-09, which was caused by the global financial crisis. The Covid-induced reduction was roughly in line with the scale of cuts that will be needed every year until 2030 to reach the Paris goals, according to last year’s report. Officials said the change caused by the disease was accidental, temporary and involved too much suffering to be replicable, but the economic stimulus that follows could make a substantial difference if it is used to decarbonise. “We can’t lock up the world and stop the engines of our economy running,” Andersen said. “But we learned a lesson. Now we need to make sure that the money we are shovelling into recovery goes to a good cause. Let’s make sure it isn’t used to go down the old path. There might never be another opportunity to put all this money into the economy. We will have to borrow from the future to do that, so let’s not leave the next generation with a huge debt and a broken planet.” The UN estimates that the levels of ambition in the Paris agreement must be roughly tripled to put the world on track for 2C and increased at least fivefold for 1.5C. So far, economic recovery plans have been disappointing. Covid-19 spending has overwhelmingly supported the status quo or fostered new high-carbon investments, the report says. As of October, barely a quarter of G20 members had dedicated relief stimulus explicitly to low-carbon measures. The outlook could improve soon. The UN figures do not account for the recent flurry of upgraded climate pledges. China – the world’s biggest emitter by far – has committed to be carbon-neutral by 2060, while the EU, Japan, South Korea and South Africa aim for the same goal by mid-century. The UK has gone a step further by enshrining its net-zero target in law and promising a 68% cut by 2030 as part of its national determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris agreement. The report says 126 countries, covering 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have net-zero goals. If the US adopts a similar target by 2050, as suggested in the climate plan of the president-elect, Joe Biden, the share would increase to 63%. Andersen said these developments gave more cause for optimism this year than last, but she urged more nations to raise their ambitions and to incorporate concrete short-term policies into their NDCs. “Those numbers are encouraging, But it is one thing to declare a net-zero goal and another to say how it will be achieved. So far none of the net-zero commitments have been translated into NDCs.” This will be addressed at this weekend’s climate ambition summit to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris agreement and at a key UN climate conference in Glasgow next year, COP26. “The emissions gap report shows us the tragedy of Covid has provided us with an opening,” said Archie Young, the UK’s lead climate negotiator for Cop26. “We expect to see a whole range of new commitments on mitigation, finance and adaptation.” This year’s report also tackles emissions sources that have until now escaped inclusion in national plans: aviation, shipping and high-consumption lifestyles. The paper stresses the need for wealthy individuals to take more responsibility. It says the richest 1% of the global population emit more than twice as much carbon as the poorest 50%. “This elite will need to reduce their footprint by a factor of 30 to stay in line with the Paris agreement targets,” it says. Andersen reiterated, however, that the most important step is a second phase of green spending that goes much further than the first. Compared with last year, she said, “We are in a better place. We have seen what is possible – though for the wrong reason – and we are now seeing net-zero pledges. If – and it is an if – the next stimulus is aligned with decarbonisation, we will be in a good position.”"
"I wholeheartedly support the idea of increasing the amount of woodland we have i n Britain, especially in England, which is very thinly forested by northern European standards (Restore UK woodland by letting trees plant themselves, says report, 15 December). But the problem with “just letting nature get on with it” is twofold: first, ecological succession takes a long time. And second, Britain now contains so many invasive plant and animal species that we may never get the resulting forests we hope for through a policy of benign neglect. In other words, some management will always be required. Consider the sycamore tree, an incredibly fecund species now common in every corner of these islands. Just four centuries ago, it was all but unknown in Britain. Unfortunately, there are very few insect species associated with sycamore, and no fungi, so the native fauna derive almost zero gain from this species. Moreover, a hillside that is thick with young sycamore saplings denies water and light to slower-growing competing trees. Compare this with the beech – another non-native species that has naturalised here, but one that is far less fecund and has a huge number of associated insect and fungi species. Beech only thrives in particular soils, but sycamore will proliferate almost anywhere. In other words, if we want to maximise biodiversity in our wild spaces, we need to consider what grows there, and what food webs and habitats are built and supported. There is no guarantee that nature, unassisted, will arrive at a desired outcome. Robin Prior Stroud, Gloucestershire • Whether new woodlands are planted, or generate themselves as recently recommended by Rewilding Britain, their success will not be maximised unless there is a parallel strategy on the control of our deer populations. The simple fact is that there are far too many deer and they are incredibly destructive of young trees. It may be difficult to convince the animal-loving British public that deer need culling in large numbers, but unless that happens many tree-planting initiatives will be hampered by either deer predation or the high costs of expensive fencing. Perhaps a good place to start would be to extol the merits of venison as a far healthier meat than that from factory-farmed livestock. There’s a venison supply chain out there just waiting to be exploited for the common good. Patrick Cosgrove Bucknell, Shropshire • Rewilding Britain’s report on natural regeneration of woodlands by seed is welcome but hardly new. As Oliver Rackham wrote in his 1986 book The History of the Countryside: “Tree-planting is not synonymous with conservation; it is an admission that conservation has failed.” Tree-planting is generally viewed as a good thing. It is measurable and responds to target setting, but it requires a lot of much less sexy follow-up – maintenance, irrigation, and protection from browsing animals – much of which doesn’t happen, with predictable results. The success rate of planted trees is hugely variable but we are all aware that many fail. Trees growing from seed, in situ, will grow better, faster, more securely rooted and suited to the prevailing conditions. They are genetically varied, much less prone to disease, and of course they are not bringing in diseases from elsewhere. They will grow to a shape moulded by the environment rather than being uniform, straight-trunked and dull. Let’s give them a chance. Alex Johnson (Chartered landscape architect), Bristol • The recommendations of Rewilding Britain should be quickly taken up by the government. The current drive to plant trees is funding forestry companies to plant 65% Sitka spruce, grown as a timber crop with little benefit to wildlife or biodiversity. Despite widespread knowledge about carbon capture within soil, Scottish moorlands covered in shallow to deep layers of peat are being ploughed and planted with swathes of these trees at an alarming rate. The landscape is being transformed into industrial monoculture plantations, without much hope of reducing climate change. We must stop this before it is too late.

"This is a disappearing watery world – always on the verge of surrender to the churning belt of brine beyond the shingle bank. The path in midwinter is flooded and, standing with my sketchbook, feet like the reeds’ in the clear dark water, I think of Elizabeth Bishop’s poem Sandpiper: “… that every so often the world is bound to shake”. This fragile place shakes and shimmers continuously. Nothing is still. France Woods, to my west, is opalescent in the late afternoon, its many oaks a flat plane of optical greys as the weak sun sinks behind the hill. The water between us dances with tiny halations – lead-white and gold. Ash, sycamore and alder branches sweep and tangle in the foreground, bone-black and intricate against the light. Goat willows, toughly delicate, dark green and grey, fan into the listening heavens, offering up just a few slim ovals of bronze – tiny brushstrokes of colour in the December sky. From the top of a young sycamore (her smooth bark a pale, raw umber, buds perfect in their as yet unwrecked opposing symmetry), a robin effortlessly sings the spaces between things. What am I doing? My left boot has started to let in the icy water and my hands, even gloved, are numb. I’ve been drawing for an hour and have only a page of scribbles to show for it – pathetic grasping attempts to describe and outline. Tethered to form in a formless world. From somewhere in the reeds there is the muffled trumpet of a coot, and a cormorant slides rapidly out of his reflection to swallow a struggling eel in the open water. Mesmerised, I can clearly see the writhing lump fight and bulge in the bird’s long throat. Low in the water, he raises his hooked bill, repeatedly stretches, and dips. Sipping water, easing the meal down. Later, from his oak perch, he preens and ignores me (he has seen me before), a strange and wingless biped who understands nothing. The evening lays out her dark pieces, and I abandon my drawing to watch him: Miltonian creature, wingèd eel, part of this place, part of this paradise, this world of loss; alive until he isn’t."
"A growing number of “cryptic species” hiding in plain sight have been unmasked in the past year, driven in part by the rise of DNA barcoding, a technique that can identify and differentiate between animal and plant species using their genetic divergence. The discovery of new species of aloe, African leaf-nosed bats and chameleons that appear similar to the human eye but are in fact many and separate have thrilled and worried conservationists. Scientists say our planet might be more biologically diverse than previously thought, and estimates for the total number of species could be far higher than the current best guess of 8.7 million. But cryptic discoveries often mean that species once considered common and widespread are actually several, some of which may be endangered and require immediate protection. The Jonah’s mouse lemur was only unveiled to the world this summer but is already on the verge of extinction. The newly described Popa langur in Myanmar, previously confused with another species, numbers around 200 and is likely to be classified as critically endangered, threatened by habitat loss and deforestation. The discovery of these cryptic species has been driven in part by the rise of DNA barcoding, a technique that can identify and differentiate between animal and plant species using their genetic divergence. African elephants, Indian vine snakes and South American neotropical birds are among the growing number of unmaskings. Thousands more are expected in the coming years, from living creatures and museum samples. “DNA barcoding is a tool that allows us to detect differences among species at a finer scale than before, like a microscope allows us to see fine details of surface structure that are invisible to the naked eye,” says Brian Brown, entomology curator at the LA Natural History Museum, who is using the technique for research on flies. “It gives us a way to delimit some of the previously suspected, but unexplored, diversity within what we call species. It is showing that the world is even more wonderfully biodiverse than we suspected.” The first cryptic species discoveries made using DNA barcoding were in Guanacaste conservation area (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica, now the most DNA barcoded place on Earth. In a paper entitled Ten Species in One, Canadian professor Paul Hebert, known as the “father of DNA barcoding”, revealed the true identities of the two-barred flasher butterfly in 2004, along with University of Pennsylvania professors Daniel Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs, who have dedicated their lives to the ACG. It was an insect that had bothered Janzen for decades. Taxonomic consensus told the 81-year-old evolutionary ecologist that the caterpillar samples he collected in the ACG were those of a common, unremarkable tropical butterfly found from Texas to northern Argentina. But he did not believe it. Janzen had always been puzzled by the diversity of two-barred flasher caterpillars – Astraptes fulgerator – and the variety of plants on which they feasted. So when in 2004 he had the opportunity to test a controversial new technique called DNA barcoding put forward by Hebert (then primarily known for his expertise on water fleas), he knew which insect samples he would send. The results were thrilling. In his study area alone, the barcoding analysis indicated the two-barred flasher butterfly was, in fact, at least 10 genetically distinct species. The revelation of the butterfly as a cryptic species could mean across the rest of Latin America there are thousands of unidentified insect species waiting to be described – along with many that have never been collected and examined. The findings were highly controversial and provoked a backlash from taxonomists and biologists who questioned whether genetic information should be included in identifying a species. Others did not agree that a binary, genetic threshold should be imposed on the continual process of evolution. For centuries, humanity’s understanding of life on Earth was based on the physical form. Every organism in the library of life fits within a hierarchy of classifications based on appearance, according to the modern taxonomic system first developed by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. “God created, Linnaeus organised,” he immodestly told people. Today, the technique is commonly used alongside traditional Linnaean-based methods, quickly separating samples before further genetic and morphological analysis. Among the sceptics nearly 20 years ago was Brown, who is now responsible for a large unmasking: species once lumped together as Megaselia sulphurizona, a type of humpback fly, also collected in the ACG. DNA barcoding analysis of samples across Latin America revealed 16 separate species, according to his unpublished research with co-authors. “I thought I could tell my species perfectly well by looking at genitalia,” says Brown, referring to the common practice of identifying insects by studying their reproductive organs. “I didn’t really care if I was going as quickly as possible. But when I started working on this group of small flies, I realised what I was calling one species was actually 16 and that I wasn’t able to identify them morphologically like I thought.” Another convert, Michael Sharkey, an entomologist and emeritus professor at the University of Kentucky, DNA barcoded the insects he had classified for his PhD, only to realise that most of the species concepts he had proposed after three years of hard work were incorrect. “It would have been much better if I had never published. I am happy to have had that experience though; it has taught me that despite best efforts morphological evidence is not sufficient. Barcodes will have their drawbacks as well, but they are a vast improvement,” he wrote of the experience. Either way, the direction of travel is clear. “We’re not going to be looking at genital apertures in beetles in 50 years from now to tell which species were on a tree,” Hebert says. Brown says that if, as he suspects, some species are much rarer than previously thought that only makes conservation efforts more urgent. “I look at my flies and there are maybe 100,000, maybe a million, undescribed species of them in the world. We don’t really know. But if we don’t use methods that take into account genetic divergence, we’re never going to get close to the truth.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"A flash of green and red against the lawn’s matt white stubble: striking colours at any time of year, startling at this one. It’s December, and the little alien is back. This male green woodpecker, the largest species of Britain’s three, has been visiting the garden for three years now. By that, I mean he has visited three times, each within the same calendar fortnight. We presume it’s the same bird, of course. We’ve discussed a name, too, though this particular bird doesn’t need any more of those. Yockel, Yappingale, Laughing Betsy – all rural appellations referencing the cacophonous, cackling call. He also has a spot, about 20 metres from the house. You don’t miss birds like this. Those markings, yes, all patches and caps and aeronautical chevrons, like a weird flight suit. But his movements too: antsy, wired, as if waiting to be swooped upon. The way he hammers the ground, mining for ants in the nest under his feet. Both previous years, after a few days, he was gone. This year, same. We’re lucky with our birds: at low level through the year we get all kinds, from finches to starlings (who once moved in to our loft) to noisy blackbirds and territorial robins, all watched by a parade of aerial observers: red kites, seagulls, this week a kestrel. But this guy seems to just drop in, in mid-December, always on the lawn, then drop straight out. And I started to wonder why. Where did he go in between? Where was his nest? And moreover, why this garden, at exactly this time of year? I wouldn’t ever get to know the answers. Instead, I just enjoy that he’s here. The frost is hard this year, and I watch him pound at the ground. On what turns out to be his last visit, I watch him through a camera lens. Fascinating. I see something in his mouth and presume a worm: it’s his tongue, retracting back into his head. And that eye: silvery, inscrutable. He’s looking up in the danger direction again, and I take a picture before he’s gone. I look and see that I’ve caught his nictating membrane, mid-slide, over his right eye. I can’t see the other, so I take it as a wink. See you next year, I hope."
"A vaccine for HIV: ‘This is an incredibly exciting result’ The Covid-19 vaccinations captured the world’s attention in November yet, around the same time, researchers behind a trial known as HPTN 084 also published spectacular results. The trial, which took place across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, found that an eight-weekly injection with a drug called cabotegravir was more effective than daily medication in an oral pill form in preventing HIV in women. An estimated 38 million people in the world are currently living with HIV – two thirds of these people live in Africa. In South Africa, more than 62% of the 7.5 million adults living with HIV are women. While a pre-exposure prophylactic pill is currently available for people at risk, the HPTN 084 trial – undertaken by the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) and partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – found cabotegravir to be 89% more effective. “The injection overcame many of the challenges that women in the region experience with taking a daily pill,” trial chair Dr Sinéad Delany-Moretlwe says, explaining that stigma often prevents people taking their pill consistently. “Partners may feel insecure because they think it means their partners are going to be unfaithful and just generally women experience judgments about being sexually active,” she explains. Delany-Moretlwe, who works at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, says that the injection is “discreet and convenient and not visible” and therefore “overcomes barriers” for many women in African countries. The HPTN 084 trial involved 3,223 cisgender women ranging in age from 18 to 45. Only four women who received the injection acquired HIV compared to 34 women who took the pill. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a result like this for HIV prevention in women,” says Delany-Moretlwe. “This is a product that can be used by men and women, when it’s licensed, potentially, so I think that’s what’s exciting.” “I’ve worked in HIV prevention for a long time and I know we’ve had more disappointments than successes,” Delany-Moretlwe says, but “it’s an incredibly exciting result. With introduction and use of the injection, we can hopefully begin to see the reduction and possibly elimination of HIV acquisition in young women in our region.” Amelia Tait Bristol: the people behind Britain’s greenest big city Imagine a city where power is generated from turbines and waterways. Where cycle paths, green space, allotments, veg boxes and vegan restaurants are plentiful, buses are powered by human waste and streets are closed so kids can play. It’s not a fantasy. It’s happening today in Bristol, a city increasingly feted for pioneering environmentally friendly urban life. The first city in the world to declare a climate emergency and Britain’s first European Green Capital, it is consistently top of various green matrices. This year it was judged the most environmentally friendly big British city based on high recycling rates (47.4%), generous green space (29 hectares), council seats held by the Green party (11) and carbon emissions and gas consumption. A green virtuous circle appears to be whirling in the West Country, as environmentally conscious citizens urge their leaders to make more ambitious climate commitments. In 2014, Britain’s first “poo bus” was launched, its journeys between Bristol and Bath entirely powered by human and food waste. Bristol’s leaders have looked further ahead than most. Back in 2007, the city began powering its 34,000 street lights with green electricity and, by 2014/15, it had reduced its emissions by 38% compared with 2005. The Bristol Energy Co-operative’s most exciting new scheme proposes using the water flowing through Netham weir in the city to generate electricity. A community team working at the Lawrence Weston housing estate gained planning permission for the tallest turbine of its kind in England, which will power all 3,500 homes in the area. Other schemes include a phone app using thermal imaging to help 70% of residents who struggle to pay their electricity bills identify the energy efficiency of their homes. Traders then fix problems for an affordable fee. Mark Pepper, project development manager of Ambition Lawrence Weston, says “from being seen as a middle-class problem” paying attention to the climate crisis is now seen as a way of investing in the future. As well as being a middle-class concern, environmental issues have typically been championed by people who are overwhelmingly white. This, too, is changing in Bristol, the first major city in Europe to elect a black mayor, Marvin Rees. “Someone said, ‘I hear the voice, I hear what the voice says but I don’t hear my voice’,” says Carlton Romaine, coordinator of the Black and Green Ambassadors project in Bristol, which aims to create a new generation of environmental leaders from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. “We want to empower the BAME community because we’re always at the bottom and we’re usually add-ons,” says Romaine. “We want to be leading green projects or at least a partner, not just somebody that is asked to do something.” Patrick Barkham Vodka made out of thin air: toasting the planet’s good health The Air Company, based in New York, makes vodka from two ingredients: carbon dioxide and water. Each bottle that’s produced takes carbon dioxide out of the air. It has been chosen as one of the finalists in the $20m NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, which aims to incentivise innovation in the field of carbon capture, utilisation and storage. The company’s chief technology officer, Stafford Sheehan, hit upon the idea while trying to create artificial photosynthesis as a chemistry PhD student at Yale. Photosynthesis, you may remember from chemistry at school, is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert CO2 into energy. For 2bn years, plants were equal to the task of balancing the carbon in the atmosphere – but now we are emitting it at a rate beyond what nature can restore with photosynthesis. Hence the interest in carbon capture. “Our aim is to take CO2 that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere and transform it into things that are better for the planet,” says Sheehan A nice cold martini is undoubtedly better for the planet than global warming. Unfortunately, however, it would require 11 quadrillion Air Vodka Martinis to make any kind of significant impact. But Sheehan hopes to make alcohol for a variety of different applications. “Ethanol, methanol and propanol are three of the most-produced chemicals in the world, all alcohols,” he says. “Plastics, resins, fragrances, cleaners, sanitisers, bio-jet fuel… almost all start from alcohol. If we can make the base alcohol for all of those from carbon that would otherwise be emitted, that would make a major impact.” Air Company currently captures its CO2 from old-fashioned alcohol production: concentrated CO2 rising from a standard fuel-alcohol fermentation stack is transformed into vodka. That’s a fairly boutique product. However, power stations are much more plentiful sources. “You can burn natural gas, then capture the CO2 you’re emitting, and that feeds you the carbon dioxide,” says Sheehan. “That’s what we’d like to do and that’s where you can do it at scale.” Richard Godwin Cleaning up the ocean: ‘Things that seem insoluble can be solved’ The Pacific Trash Vortex is the largest accumulation of rubbish in the world. Ocean currents mean the Eastern Garbage Patch near Japan is locked in a perpetual exchange of tyres, toothbrushes, discarded Minion toys, etc, with the Western Garbage Patch, between California and Hawaii. It spans more than 1m sq miles. Most of it is plastic: an estimated 87,000 metric tonnes broken down into 1.8tn tiny pieces. In 2012, a Dutch teenager named Boyan Slat gave a Ted Talk that had grown out of a school project. He revealed a plan to install a series of floating platforms that would harness those ocean currents and concentrate the rubbish in tighter areas, making it easier to remove. He founded the company Ocean Cleanup in 2013 and raised over $40m in funding. “There isn’t an instruction manual for doing this,” says Slat when I connect with him over video link – no longer a wide-eyed kid but a shaggy haired 25-year-old. After much research and trial and error, the company is now concentrating most of its efforts on rivers, stopping at source most of the plastic before it can get into the oceans. However, Ocean Cleanup achieved a significant milestone last year by extracting plastic from the ocean and turning it into something useful: sunglasses, yours for $199. The frames only represent a drop in the ocean in terms of plastic extracted, but Slat hopes they will create a virtuous circle. Each pair will fund the clean-up of up to 24 football fields of plastic from the Garbage Patch. “It would be quite poetic if we could fund the clean-up by recycling the plastic we take out.” Slat sees 2021 as an inflection point – the moment to deliver on its promises. “We have the tools to do it now. We have applied the lessons we’ve learned. Now it comes to actually doing it at scale.” What gives him hope? “The willingness of the world to address the issue. When we started, I thought the main difficulty would be people not caring – and the technology would be relatively easy. Actually it’s the opposite. But that makes me hopeful that when all the tools are there, it will actually happen. It is possible, even in this time when everything seems so polarised, to tackle problems through all the things humans are good at: entrepreneurship, ingenuity, creativity. It can bring people together. Things that seem insoluble can be solved.” Richard Godwin Saved from extinction: the rare species back from the brink Antarctic blue whales Blue whales were abundant off South Georgia before industrial whaling arrived in 1904. By the 1970s they had vanished from the surrounding seas. Between 1998 and 2018 there was only a single sighting. This year, that changed: there have been 58 blue whale sightings. Kakapo The kakapo is the world’s heaviest, longest-lived parrot – a flightless, nocturnal creature which, like New Zealand’s other flightless birds, was imperilled by the mammalian predators introduced by humans. Years of conservation efforts had saved it from extinction, but then the species was struck down by the respiratory disease aspergillosis. Stricken birds were helicoptered to Auckland and treated in a human hospital with a paediatric nebuliser. The virus was contained and the population now stands at 213. Beavers It seemed like 2020 was the year every grand estate obtained a licence to release beavers into large, fenced enclosures. The beaver is increasingly valued as a natural flood-defence engineer, with its dams storing water upstream and slowing the flow of flood water, protecting towns downstream. Its ponds and channels have also been shown to benefit fish, amphibians, insects and birds. This year, the government in England allowed beavers unofficially released in the River Otter in Devon to stay, paving the way for its return as a natural native species, 400 years after being hunted to extinction. Great fox spider The critically endangered spider was feared to be extinct in Britain. But the nocturnal 5cm arachnid, known for its speed, agility and ambush hunting, has been rediscovered on a Ministry of Defence site in Surrey. Mike Waite from Surrey Wildlife Trust rediscovered the spider after being allowed in to survey the area over a two-year period. MoD sites are often wildlife havens with land undisturbed by the general public. Hen harrier A fine spring and summer across the UK meant that voles bred prolifically in the wild, in turn helping birds of prey enjoy successful breeding years. The endangered hen harrier enjoyed its best breeding year for nearly two decades. Nineteen nests produced 60 chicks. Patrick Barkham Regenerative farming: a return to nature-friendly agriculture Four years ago, Rebecca Mayhew lost her job, then the pigs on the farm she owned with her husband Stuart were plagued by health problems due to the way they were intensively farmed. The couple became uneasy about the animals’ welfare and the health of their conventionally farmed land, so they sold their pigs and took a holiday in Scotland, where Rebecca fell in love with a friend’s Jersey cows. Four years on, their once-conventional arable and pig farm is a very different beast. The Mayhews have embraced regenerative farming, a way of working that aims to fix the food production system by restoring degraded soils and reducing and ultimately eliminating artificial fertilisers and pesticides. The revolution at the Mayhews’ 500-acre South Norfolk farm began with a small herd of Jersey cows. Unlike a traditional dairy, where calves are removed from their mothers after a few hours and fed formula, they chose to produce milk naturally, allowing calves to feed from their mothers, who are milked just once a day. “Looking into what’s good for the cows, and what’s good for us led us into looking at what’s good for the land,” says Rebecca. The Mayhews have jettisoned the farming orthodoxies of the past half-century. Ploughing is sacrilege: it erodes fertile top-soil. Decades of relentless scaling-up is turned on its head: big fields are turned into smaller fields – hedges replanted to stop erosion and provide shade and fodder for the cattle. Grazing fields that would normally be sown with a monoculture of rye-grass are instead seeded with up to 20 species to provide healthier food for the cattle (which, in turn, need fewer expensive veterinary drugs). Arable fields are planted with “cover crops”: so clovers are planted alongside barley or oats. Clovers are “nitrogen-fixing” plants that take nitrogen from the atmosphere and add it to soil, so it can be used by other plants – a free fertiliser and soil-improver. “Modern conventional farming is a constant war with nature. It’s about killing everything so one plant can grow,” says Mayhew. “We need to mimic nature and work with it.” The Mayhews’ new way of farming is nature-friendly so they’ve been able to take advantage of government subsidies for wildlife-enhancing farming. British farmers know that generous EU farm subsidies are coming to an end and farm payments in the future are likely to be more dependent on farms providing environmental “goods” such as healthy soils and clean water. Patrick Barkham Bringing sight to the blind: developing a new artificial eye Between the ages of 42 and 57, Bernardeta Gómez from Spain couldn’t see a thing. But then scientists embedded a port into her skull and after 16 years of blindness, Gómez was able to see again. It was all thanks to the innovations of Eduardo Fernandez, director of neuroengineering at the University of Miguel Hernández in Elche, Spain. Fernandez is working on a unique cure for blindness – instead of developing an artificial retina, he has created a device that restores sight by feeding signals directly to the brain. As the majority of blind people have damage to the nerve system connecting the retina and the brain, Fernandez’s work could help more people than developing an artificial eye. Fernandez has compared his prosthesis to a pacemaker or cochlear implants, both of which are pieces of electronic equipment that have been widely implanted into humans for more than 60 years. His system is made of a small camera attached to a pair of slightly outsized black glasses. This relays live video to a computer, which translates the footage into electronic signals. These signals are sent through a cable to a 100-electrode implant in the brain’s visual cortex (hence the port in the back of Gómez’s head), which deliver currents directly to the brain, producing sight. Gómez was able to see a low-resolution representation of objects rendered by white-yellow dots and shapes. She could see lights, letters and shapes at 10 pixels by 10 pixels. Although she couldn’t make out human faces, she was able to play a simple computer game “piped directly into her brain”. Unfortunately, the implant had to be removed after a year. “The body’s immune system starts to break down the electrodes and surround them with scar tissue,” explains Fernandez, “which eventually weakens the signal.” He hopes to continue testing his bionic eye while figuring out ways to stop the implant degrading. Ultimately, the prosthesis will be wireless. Amelia Tait Celebrity philanthropy: when the great are also really good Among the many novel terms that have entered our lives lately – “lockdown,” “herd immunity,” “flatten the curve” – one is decidedly more glamorous. In November it was suggested that “Dollying” should become shorthand for referencing an occasion when a celebrity does something that makes you love them even more. This was in response to the revelation that Dolly Parton had contributed $1m towards the Moderna Covid vaccine, news which was met with euphoria as we collectively – and only slightly melodramatically – exclaimed that Dolly had “saved the world”. Yet before we add “Dollying” to the dictionary, let’s consider the competition. How about “Doing a Rashford”, in reference to Man Utd’s striker Marcus Rashford forcing the UK government to confront child poverty and reinstate free meals for underprivileged schoolchildren? “Riri-ing” could also work, following Rihanna’s donation of $2m to charities supporting domestic-violence victims during lockdown. And then there’s “Pitting” (I sense this cute word game has now run its course), after Brad Pitt was spotted delivering groceries to disadvantaged LA households. The internet squealed with delight. These acts stand out in a year in which celebrities have been stripped of red carpets and live concerts and rendered impotent, left to spout platitudes over social media. Philanthropy has become common ever since Bob Geldof’s Live Aid concerts for famine-stricken Ethiopia in the 1980s, and is now so widespread it’s “almost part of the job description of an A-list star,” says Jo Littler, sociology professor at London’s City University. It is, she adds, “a form of brand promotion”. This means we have an ingrained scepticism when we see a celebrity doing a good thing: is it genuine or a PR play? Evan Ross Katz, a fashion writer and podcast host, says acts resonate when, instead of “affixing themselves to something because it’s trendy,” the celeb has a personal connection to the cause. Such was the case with Rashford, who subsisted on free school meals growing up, or ASAP Rocky, who last month delivered meals to the homeless shelter in New York where he and his mum sought refuge when he was young. Gestures needn’t be grand. Ryan Reynolds recently sent 300 parkas to a school in the remote Inuit community of Arctic Bay after the town’s mayor tweeted that they were desperate for winter gear. Justin Timberlake bought a wheelchair-friendly van for a teenager with cerebral palsy. And Taylor Swift’s longstanding custom of helping out regular folks continued when she paid for an 18-year-old to study maths at a UK university. We don’t need our celebs to be decent people but when they are – and in a way that isn’t overly forced and holier-than-thou – it provides a much-needed boost to our battered morale. Jamie Waters Anti-ageing: the worms that may help us live longer, healthier lives At first glance, Jarod Rollins’s work looks like magic. In a cove on an island off the coast of Maine, Rollins spends his days examining transparent worms in the hopes of extending human life. Of course, it’s not really magic, it’s science: Rollins works at the MDI Biological Laboratory, a non-profit research institution, and is motivated by a desire to “help people age more gracefully or even turn back the ageing process”. In July 2019, Rollins and 10 other researchers from across the globe made a monumental breakthrough: they increased the lifespan of some Caenorhabditis elegans worms by 500%. The reason these unassuming roundworms are frequently used in ageing research is because they share many of their genes with humans. An ordinary C elegans worm will live for three to four weeks – Rollins and his team kept them alive for months. “If we do make a discovery in C elegans and find a gene that helps regulate the rate at which they age, there is a good chance that that research is going to apply directly or indirectly to humans,” he explains. “I’m not in the business of making worms live longer,” he laughs, “I want to make people live longer and healthier, and worms are just one step on the way.” The worms in the experiment lived longer because his colleagues in China altered two signalling pathways in their cells. These pathways were previously both linked to ageing – in the past, experiments altering one of the pathways had doubled C elegans’s life expectancy, while experiments with the other increased the worms’ lifespan by 30%. The team expected that altering both pathways simultaneously would see worms living 130% longer. Instead, they lived five times longer. Mutating the two pathways sends signals to cells telling them to use dietary nutrients to go into “maintenance mode” instead of “growth mode” – fixing the damage caused by age. But what are the immediate repercussions? Rollins explains that scientists used to look for one “silver bullet” in anti-ageing research, but the therapies that “are going to have the most effect are probably going to stimulate multiple different genetic pathways at once… This is really going to change how people look at the ageing process.” Amelia Tait Why 2020 will make us better Troubled eras have always inspired positive human progress – and 2020 will be no different, says Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford University This year has been a terrible and chastening experience. But rather than allow doom and despair to sweep us away, we should be optimistic about the future – and in the long run, we might just owe 2020 a debt of thanks, rather than mutter its name with spite. The experiences of this year will – and must – teach important lessons about being better prepared for future epidemics. It will lead to greater understanding of how to plan and execute large-scale emergency responses more quickly and more efficiently and with better outcomes. And it will make us think about the risks and threats in the world around us with greater clarity and depth. The fact that Covid-19 vaccines have been developed with astonishing speed might encourage those who fear the worst about other big problems. Climate change is the most obvious mega-threat: in the long run, our pandemic experiences must help with that. While Covid hit the economy, one outcome may be smarter policy that looks to keep people in jobs, ensures towns and city centres remain vibrant and encourages small businesses to flourish and grow – rather than enabling virtual monopolies to impose strangleholds over the economy which heighten social inequalities. And 2020 has forced a recalibration of ambitions and expectations on a personal level. At the start of the year, our aims might have included a promotion or a higher salary. Today, those hopes have been replaced by something rather more modest and, indeed, better for us: to see friends, visit the pub, watch live sports, go to the theatre or visit somewhere new. Outside the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd in May proved a catalyst in raising voices who demand a fairer, more equitable and kinder society. It forced global public attention to focus on the realities of discrimination and racism, to recognise that there might be better alternatives to having statutes of rich slave-owners towering over town squares and that cultural imperialism did not end when the age of empire did. Beyond 2020? We would do well to remember that, in the past 30 years, more people have been lifted out of poverty than ever before; more children and mothers have survived childbirth; more people are able to read and write than at any point in human history. For all the horrors of the year, hope is still present – as the historian Agathias wrote in the sixth century, times of disaster throw up prophets who talk about doom and gloom and predict how much worse things will get with great certainty. Much better, then, to be positive and optimistic."
"I’d like to assure Judith Kent in Barnet (Letters, 24 December) that redwings have not entirely fled the country. Half a dozen have been stripping the holly tree outside my bathroom window for the past week, so I was faced with a dilemma: was I more pleased to see them, or concerned that there wouldn’t be enough berry-laden boughs to deck the halls? We reached a compromise: I took the small lower branches and left the redwings to enjoy the rest. Cate Gunn Colne Engaine, Essex • Large numbers of redwings spent the week before Christmas stripping the berries from every holly bush in this area. Perhaps they are working their way across London from south to north and will be in Barnet soon, Covid travel restrictions permitting. Sue Todd Sutton, London • We also still use the Guardian angel (Letters, 23 December). My stepdaughter replaced the angel’s head with my angelic features, and I still inflict it on the family all these years later. I’m considering making it a condition of my will that she continues the tradition she started. Neil Batey Deal, Kent • The government has listed the 72 high streets that have been awarded or provisionally awarded help to fund their recovery (Report, 26 December). The city that’s had more lockdowns and restrictions than any other is strangely absent. Why? Veronica Matthew Leicester • It is interesting to see how well vital research is funded. Your picture essay (21 December) shows a computer at the forefront of vaccine development in Oxford clearly still running Windows 7. Martin Tolley Towcester, Northamptonshire • Hooray! I had all the ingredients to make Ottolenghi’s Boxing Day leftover veg samosas (Feast, 26 December). Great stuff. June Nicholls Lichfield, Staffordshire"
"With millions of us now cooking from scratch during lockdown, many are keeping up the fight against the global plastic binge and seeking more eco-friendly options to help store cooked and raw food in our fridges and avoid waste. Pick up any cookbook or food magazine from the past few decades, and chances are the words “wrap in clingfilm” will be standard advice. Clingfilm is invaluable for covering dishes of leftovers or wrapping awkwardly shaped food items. But the problem with standard film is that it can be difficult to recycle as it contains a plastic called polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Among other plastic-free options, reusable cotton wraps imbued with beeswax provide an an eco-friendly alternative to clingfilm. Once a niche product – as well as prohibitively expensive - they have moved into the mainstream over the last couple of years and are now widely available online and in supermarkets, while it is also possible to make your own. The model has been used to preserve food for centuries – the warmth of your hands melts the wax so the sheets can be moulded around everything from bowls and plates to cheese, bread, fruit and vegetables. For health reasons, they are not appropriate for wrapping raw meat or fish. New products in development include plant-based or vegan wraps that use sumac, sunflower and even rice bran wax instead of beeswax. There’s also a proliferation of different designs and sizes, and even some suitable for use in the bathroom, to wrap soap etc. We road-tested some of the plastic-free options: 1. Lakeland compostable perforated clingfilm, £3.99 for a 30-metre x 28.5cm-wide roll, perforated every 30cm Produced by an Italian supplier, the polyester film is designed to break down under home and industrial home composting conditions, and it is claimed that it will disappear within 12 months without leaving any harmful residue in the compost. Instructions on the packaging make clear that it should not be used in ovens, grills or the microwave. The perforations are handy, as it is difficult to cut the film with scissors. When we wrapped a slightly soggy cheese and tomato sandwich, the clingfilm did not stick together or “cling” very well, so we would not be confident about its durability if carried around. That said, it is strong and did its job perfectly when used to cover food in containers in the fridge, with no whiff evident from an open pot of tuna. It can also be used in the freezer, although it was hard to tell whether it would survive long-term. Overall verdict: An affordable guilt-free film that is useful for many kitchen jobs but cannot be used for cooking and does not have the “clingability” of the standard version. 2. Essential Waitrose non-PVC clingfilm, £2 for a 40-metre x 35cm-wide roll. This product has been available since 2016. However, it does carry many warnings on its packaging – including on flammability – and is not recommended for covering dishes when heating or defrosting food in microwaves. For this purpose, Waitrose recommends its standard all-purpose clingfilm. We ended up wasting a lot of the film when trying to unwind it and cut it – and it needed large amounts to make it “stick” to itself. We were able to wrap the cheese and tomato sandwich but in mummy-like layers as it did not seem very strong. Not good for food on the move. Although it is not compostable it is described as “widely recycled”. Overall verdict: Has lots of uses in the kitchen, provided you accept its restrictions and keep away from the heat. 3. The Beeswax Wrap Co’s pack of five beeswax wraps; £30 from beeswaxwraps.co.uk and other retailers. The company makes all its wraps in the Cotswolds and says they are washable, reusable and compostable on home compost heaps, while the durability of cotton means it won’t tear. It has collaborations with designers such as Emma Bridgewater and its beeswax wrap eco-starter gift bundle has been so popular as a Christmas gift that it is sold out. Again, there are some warnings, and the wraps must be kept away from heat or naked flames, not used in the microwave and should not be used with raw meat or fish. Our cheese and tomato sandwich fared well in the medium wrap, which held at bay any seepage. We found the smaller wraps were ideal for complete leftovers such as half-avocados, or for covering dishes and bowls. There is an extra large wrap (50cm x 50cm) which was ideal for wrapping bread and keeping stray crumbs and seeds at bay. The smaller pieces were particularly useful for covering different types of cheese in the bottom of the fridge and avoiding mouldy “cheese mush”. They did absorb the pong although this was – eventually – washed out with cold soapy water. Overall verdict: A fun and colourful alternative to clingfilm. The price may appear punitive but if you look after your wraps they should last for a year. 4. Leaf wrap, brightly coloured and printed plant-based wax food wraps, available from Lakeland, Booths supermarkets (generally in the north), Aga Cookshops and Milk &amp; More. A pack of three costs £17.99. The wraps use plant-derived rosin and waxes instead of beeswax, meaning they are vegan-friendly. They are made by BeeBee Wraps in Cambridge, which started making the more traditional beeswax versions. Like the beeswax ones, they can be used to wrap anything except raw meat or fish and can typically be reused for a year. The wax only needed a little surface pressure before sticking down, and there was no odour at all from the wax itself. The cheese and tomato sandwich emerged unscathed from the wrapping, which was sufficiently heavy-duty but malleable. We also stored herbs in a loose pouch, and some leftover nuts. They can also be used in the freezer. We successfully froze sliced banana for a week before putting it in a smoothie, and the wrap emerged unscathed. Overall verdict: A good option for vegan consumers, with what appears to be the same quality as beeswax."
"Wood burners triple the level of harmful pollution particles inside homes and should be sold with a health warning, says scientists, who also advise that they should not be used around elderly people or children. The tiny particles flood into the room when the burner doors are opened for refuelling, a study found. Furthermore, people who load in wood twice or more in an evening are exposed to pollution spikes two to four times higher than those who refuel once or not at all. The particles can pass through the lungs and into the body and have been linked to a wide range of health damage, particularly in younger and older people. The research was conducted in 19 homes in Sheffield over the course of a month at the start of 2020. The wood burners used were all models certified by the government as “smoke exempt appliances”, meaning they produce less smoke. But this and the new EcoDesign standard, due to become compulsory by 2022, only assess outdoor pollution. The government is phasing out the sale of wet wood, which produces more smoke, but the people in the study used only dry, seasoned wood. Wood and coal burning in homes is estimated to cause almost 40% of outdoor tiny particle pollution, but the new research is among the first to analyse indoor pollution in real-life settings. Almost 16% of people in the south-east of England use wood fuel, and 18% in Northern Ireland, according to 2016 government data, and about 175,000 wood burners are sold annually. “Our findings are a cause for concern,” said Rohit Chakraborty, of the University of Sheffield, who led the study. “It is recommended that people living with those particularly susceptible to air pollution, such as children, the elderly or vulnerable, avoid using wood-burning stoves. If people want to use them, we recommend minimising the time the stove is open during lighting or refuelling.” Wood burners cause less indoor pollution than open fires. “But every time you open the door, you reduce the stove to an open fire and particulate matter floods into the home,” he said. The peaks take an hour or two to dissipate. “But by the time it comes down, someone opens the door again to refuel and you get spike after spike,” Chakraborty said. Some burners have filters, but these only reduce the pollution being vented outside. Some people without central heating rely on wood burners for heat, and Chakraborty did not call for a ban. “We should leave it to people to decide, but they should at least know what’s going on, and, of course, don’t use it if you don’t need to.” The study, published in the journal Atmosphere, analysed data collected every few minutes from pollution monitors in people’s homes and in total assessed 260 uses of wood burners. The results showed the burners were usually lit for about four hours at a time, and during this period the level of harmful particles in homes was three times higher than when stoves were not being used. During those four hours, average particle levels rose to between 27 and 195 micrograms per cubic metre of air. The World Health Organization limit is 25μg/m3 over 24 hours. “Epidemiologists are increasingly recognising that exposure to high intensities of [small particles] over much shorter periods of time – hours rather than days – is linked to a range of health issues,” the researchers wrote. They concluded: “It is recommended that new residential stoves be accompanied by a health warning at the point of sale in order to indicate the health risks posed to users.” Government approval schemes should also assess indoor pollution, the scientists said. Higher outdoor air pollution and cooking fumes were ruled out as causes of the indoor peaks. The particles are the most harmful pollutants in wood smoke, but it also contains carcinogenic chemicals including benzene and formaldehyde. “Instead of being seen as a harmless appliance, wood-burning stoves should be recognised as having the potential for harm,” said James Heydon, of the University of Nottingham, who was part of the study team. “Most of our participants were unaware of this and more needs to be done to raise awareness of the risks.” Three of the households in the study stopped using their burners after seeing the results and another 12 took action such as refuelling faster or less often, or ensuring the wood was really dry. “There is no reason to believe that particulate matter from wood-burning stoves is less toxic than that from other sources, such as combustion of fossil fuels,” said Prof Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary University of London, who led a recent report on the health effects of indoor air pollution on children for the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. “This study confirms that indoor wood burners contribute significantly to indoor air pollution,” he said. “It also suggests that even government-certified solid fuel stoves impair local outdoor air quality. It is therefore difficult to justify their use in any urban area.” A Defra spokeswoman said: “Air pollution has reduced significantly in recent years, with emissions of fine particulate matter falling 9% in the last decade. But we know there is more to do, and domestic burning is a major contributor.” She said the forthcoming environment bill would make it easier for local authorities to enforce existing restrictions within smoke control areas. Ministers are not planning a ban on wood burners."
"Deforestation has made outdoor work unsafe for millions of people in the tropics over the past 15 years, a study has found. The rise in temperatures and humidity caused by tree loss has reduced the number of safe hours in the day for people to work, especially for those performing heavy labour. “Because of climate change, these areas in the tropics are already on the edge of what’s considered safe or comfortable for working in the late morning to afternoon,” said Luke Parsons, a climate researcher at Duke University in North Carolina and lead author of the paper published in the journal One Earth. “And then you take deforestation on top of that and it pushes these regions over into even more unsafe work conditions.” A growing body of research has shown that deforestation is linked to an increase in local temperatures, as it decreases the cooling benefits trees bring to an area. For example, in the areas of the Amazon in Brazil which have been heavily deforested, over the past two decades the temperatures have been as much as 10C higher than forested regions. For this study, the researchers parsed satellite and meteorological data between 2003 and 2018 in 94 countries with tropical forests, looking at temperature and humidity. They found that almost 100,000 people, 90% of whom live in Asia, have lost more than two hours of work time a day. Almost 5 million people have lost at least half an hour of safe work time each day, the majority of them outdoor workers doing heavy physical labour. The effects are disproportionately felt in deforested locations; in the Americas, 5% of forested areas lost at least half an hour of safe work time a day, while 35% of deforested areas suffered the same loss. “We couldn’t go to every single location where people are working and measure when they stopped working,” said Parsons. “We can make this assessment of lost safe work time, but people may often in fact choose to continue to work when it is too hot and humid, at the detriment to their health.” Continued global heating and forest loss is expected to amplify these impacts, reducing work hours for vulnerable groups even more over coming decades. Exposure to heat could affect mood and mental illnesses, as well as reduce physical and psychological performance, including lapses in concentration, fatigue, irritability, increasing the risk of accidents, said Beatriz Oliveira, researcher at the Sergio Arouca National School of Public Health in Brazil, who was not involved in this study. The researchers say their findings provide an economic incentive for local populations to maintain intact local forests on top of the environmental benefits."
"The cost of abating the carbon impact of a proposed third runway at Heathrow has doubled since parliament approved the idea of expansion, a report presented to MPs suggests. A study by the New Economics Foundation suggests the carbon value or cleanup cost of the runway has increased from £50bn to £100bn, twice the figure presented to ministers and parliamentarians by the Department for Transport in the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) in 2018. The “carbon value” of the expansion is the price of abatement required to offset the carbon emissions of the runway. This autumn, the government revised carbon values to bring them into line with new legally binding net zero obligations, passed in June 2019. The report – a draft of which was presented to members of the all-party parliamentary group on Heathrow expansion and regional connectivity – suggests these changes have a significant impact on the proposed runway expansion. “In a climate emergency, any project or policy which creates new greenhouse gas emissions comes at great cost to society. Either we suffer the consequences of deeper ecological collapse, or someone, somewhere, has to ‘clean up’ those gases,” the report said. When a country, as the UK does, has a legal commitment to cut carbon emissions to zero, most options for reducing emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere are already being utilised, the report said. “The cost, therefore, of cleaning up, or ‘abating’, new emissions, gets higher as your climate ambition rises,” the report said. In September, a new set of costs of carbon abatement were released by the government. “Our calculations show that at Heathrow, the carbon cost of emissions resulting from the airport’s proposed expansion over the period 2025-2050 has doubled, from around £50bn, to over £100bn when considering the new government carbon values.” the report said. The carbon costs include that of both arriving and departing flights. The change in costs impacts all proposed airport expansion. Across eight airports planning projects all have had their climate cost dramatically underestimated, NEF says. The research suggested cumulatively the eight active airport expansion plans come with an emissions price tag of £73.6bn between 2025 and 2050. Only a fraction of this, £11.8bn, is likely to be reclaimed in taxes on the aviation industry. The remainder, £62bn, will be a cost to government and represent “a colossal subsidy to polluting industry, and significant cost – either economic, environmental, or both – to the rest of society”, the report said. David Simmonds MP, the co-chair of the APPG, said: “This report highlights the need to get the detail right when considering our future aviation picture and the government’s Jet Zero review. “We cannot afford to underestimate the implications for major projects such as Heathrow expansion and future generations will not thank us for creating complicated financial mechanisms which won’t do anything to actually help the environment.” Paul McGuinness, the chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said: “As was perhaps inevitable, Heathrow expansion’s carbon costs have escalated exponentially, even before they’ve put more greenhouse gas emitting planes into our atmosphere. The ever-growing case for the government to cancel Heathrow expansion has become incontrovertible.” When MPs voted for the Airline National Policy Statement, which contained the expansion in principle in 2018, the net economic value of it was between £3bn and -£2.5bn, he said. Now the carbon abatement cost element of Heathrow expansion has increased exponentially, the total economic impact of the scheme can only come at a great cost to the UK economy, said McGuinness. Lord Deben, the chair of the Climate Change Committee, which advises government, said last month: “There is not any space for airport expansion”. The CCC recommends “no net expansion of UK airport capacity unless the sector is on track to sufficiently outperform its net emissions trajectory and can accommodate the additional demand”. A Heathrow spokesperson said: “Reducing carbon emissions from flying has always been a central consideration of our plans to expand Heathrow. “We have always known that we will have to prove that a new runway is compatible with the UK’s net zero target. While our current focus remains on responding to the pandemic, we remain confident that we can expand and meet stringent targets. “The UK aviation sector was the first in the world to commit to net zero and publish a detailed plan to get there. The recent commitment by the whole global aviation sector to net zero and the UK government’s ambition for 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 are clear steps towards taking the carbon out of flying, even as we grow.”"
"Consecutive wet years have boosted breeding colonies of waterbirds in eastern Australia but not enough yet to increase total bird numbers, according to the latest edition of one of the world’s largest and longest nature surveys. Researchers on the annual survey, now in its 39th year, flew 38,360km – or almost enough to circumnavigate the globe – to track the abundance in more than 2,000 wetlands of about 50 bird species, from Queensland down to Victoria. Even though parts of inland Queensland registered record rains and many rivers have lately been in flood, rainfall has been patchy, with areas such as north-western Victoria still relatively dry. Years of severe drought as well as large-scale water diversions for irrigation have also taken their toll. “The sort of core resource of birds that can breed when there’s a good flood is declining, so their capacity to bounce back is getting less and less,” said Richard Kingsford, director of the University of NSW’s Centre for Ecosystem Science, who took part in his 36th consecutive survey. The monitoring counted 95,306 birds, a drop from 2020 and the third lowest tally in the almost four decades of tracking. The researchers, though, did observe increases in breeding of birds such as the Australian white ibis and straw-necked ibis. With more water around, it is also likely that birds range beyond the surveyed bands. Large flows are also making their way towards the Lake Eyre basin in central Australia, and more breeding will be triggered by that water, Kingsford said. Waterbirds are important barometers of river health, with the abundance of various species indicating the availability of vegetation, invertebrates and fish. “[They] provide you with a story about what’s going on in the rivers,” he said. When water flows into wetland systems, it improves water quality for human communities downstream but also supports native fish, frogs and river red gums “that all depend on these sort of floods coming down the system”, Kingsford said. A NSW upper house review report released on Wednesday warned that a decade of reforms under the $13bn Murray-Darling Basin Plan could be undermined if the government proceeded with plans to licence more harvesting of water on flood plains. Kingsford said water diversions for cotton, nuts and other crops had interrupted flows and made it harder to trigger natural bird breeding events. The Tallywalka wetlands in central NSW, for instance, remained dry when surveyed in October even though big rivers in the region were already high. The survey provided some good news, showing the return of more magpie geese. Numbers were smashed by poisoning for rabbits in the past, and the loss of habitat. The internationally important Macquarie Marshes also had moderate levels of water augmented by environmental flows supplied by the NSW and federal government. This water is supporting considerable numbers and diversity of waterbirds. However, the researchers counted just 57 Australasian shovelers, compared with thousands in the early years of the survey. Similarly, they observed just 105 freckled ducks, compared with more than 10,000 in previous good years. Researchers also counted 6,528 pink-eared ducks versus a dozen previous years when numbers were closer to 50,000, the report said. “One of the real advantages with having these long-term datasets that are collected in the same way every year and have been for some time, is you do [track] natural floods and droughts ,” Kingsford said. “You can start to tease out what the human impact is on these river systems.”"
"The Environment Agency has launched an investigation into alleged illegal waste activities at a landfill in Staffordshire which has plagued residents with noxious fumes for months. People living next to Walleys Quarry landfill in Silverdale, Newcastle-under-Lyme, are facing misery from strong smells caused by high levels of hydrogen sulphide on the site. The EA said it had launched a formal investigation into the landfill operators, Red Industries, after receiving new information in October. The company denies breaking any regulations. Campaigners hailed the news as an “early Christmas present” and a milestone in their fight for better air quality, although many said they felt an investigation was long overdue. “All we want is the truth. But we won’t take the pressure off the EA yet because we actually need to see the results, we won’t just accept platitudes,” said Dr Mick Salt, a resident and radiation physicist. The Newcastle-under-Lyme MP, Aaron Bell, said: “I welcome this formal investigation and I would like to thank all the sources that have come forward over the past year. This is just one step, and it is important for legal reasons not to prejudice or prejudge this investigation. However, I know the community will welcome this development.” Campaigners were dealt a blow last week when the EA won an appeal over a high court case that found it was not doing enough to control the landfill emissions that were shortening the life expectancy of a five-year-old, Mathew Richards. Mathew’s mother, Rebecca Currie, said she was “heartbroken” by the ruling and would take the case to the supreme court. “It felt like we’d put up all that fight for nothing. But my legal team are not letting it drop,” she said. “And the news of the EA’s investigation has put a smile on my face, it’s given us a big boost in the fight.” The family live half a mile from the landfill, and Currie said the fumes were still having a major impact. “We ring up [the EA] and complain about it but it doesn’t feel like it’s getting us anywhere. Mathew is coughing so bad to the extent he’s choking,” she said. The EA said it welcomed the court’s decision but added it “will not affect our determination to tackle the problems at Walleys Quarry”. It said that after the EA’s interventions, “there has been a clear downward trend in hydrogen sulphide levels recorded at our air quality monitoring stations in recent months”. Walleys Quarry Ltd, an associated company of Red Industries, said: “Walleys Quarry Ltd has never received or disposed of hazardous waste in contravention of any regulations. Any allegations that it has ever done so are baseless and wrong. “There are no grounds whatsoever for this investigation or the unprofessional way it has been publicised by the EA as a supposedly responsible regulator. Despite this, the company will cooperate fully with the EA investigation so the true facts can be established and made known at the earliest opportunity.”"
"The sale of peat to gardeners in England and Wales is to be banned by 2024 under plans published by the government on Saturday. Ministers said they also aimed to end peat use in the professional horticulture sector by 2028. The government set a voluntary target in 2011 for compost retailers to end sales of peat by 2020. But peat use fell by only 25% from 2011-2019 and increased by 9% in 2020 as Covid lockdowns boosted gardening as a hobby. Peat is the UK’s largest carbon store, trapping as much as tropical rainforests per hectare, but is routinely dug up for horticulture. This releases carbon dioxide, adding to the climate crisis. Peatlands are also vital habitats for rare species of wildlife, and help filter water and reduce flooding. However, the government consultation also contains measures that fall short of an outright ban, instead including an additional charge on the price of peat compost, or the provision of information on the environmental impact of peat at the point of sale. The government said it did not intend to ban the sale of plants in pots that contained peat and that its plans would not affect current licences for peat extraction. The environment minister Rebecca Pow said: “We are committed to bring forward the ban [on the sale of peat to gardeners] by the end of this parliament – that’s an absolute commitment.” “Our peatlands are an incredibly valuable natural resource,” she said. “There are now more sustainable and good quality peat-free alternatives available than at any other time, so I am confident now is the right time to make the shift permanent.” Sustainable alternatives to peat include compost made from wood fibre and bark, wool, coir, and other plants. Pow said the weaker measures were included because “in a consultation, it is best to be fully informed with as much evidence and data as we can have, and some people in the industry are still pressing for other potential routes”. Craig Bennett, of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The government has been dithering over this crucial issue for decades and the consultation on the use of peat by gardeners is long overdue. But it’s a damp squib. “It refers to the damaging effects of peat extraction, but this activity is still allowed in England, which is absurd. We need an immediate ban on the use of peat by individuals and the wider horticulture industry and an immediate end to extracting peat.” Prof Dave Goulson, from the University of Sussex, said: “We need to stop kicking the can down the road. The government acknowledges we are in a climate emergency, but isn’t even prepared to stop depletion of a vital carbon store for needless ornamental use in our gardens. We need to stop peat use now.” Pow said “historic” licences allowing the extraction of peat were being reviewed. Alan Titchmarsh, Kate Bradbury and James Wong are among the high-profile gardeners who have backed a ban, and Monty Don has called peat in compost “environmental vandalism”. Peat may become harder to buy in the UK in any case because most is imported from bogs in Ireland, where the state-backed company Bord na Móna ended all peat extraction in 2020, although its reserves are still being sold. Some big retailers of peat have implemented their own bans, including Dobbies and the Co-op in 2021, and B&amp;Q by 2023. About 70% of peat is sold to gardeners and 30% is used by professional growers. The government estimates a ban on both uses would cut CO2 emissions by 4m tonnes in the next two decades. The government also announced £4m to boost 10 peat restoration projects across England, including in the Fens, Dorset, Somerset and Yorkshire. Almost 90% of peatland in England is in a degraded state and it emits 10m tonnes of CO2 a year. In May, ministers announced a £50m plan to restore 35,000 hectares of peatland by 2025, about 1% of the UK’s total. “It’s a really positive start,” said Pow, saying that these investments leveraged other funds focused on water management and increasing biodiversity."
"Almost two-thirds of the hundreds of mollusc species that live in the deep sea are at risk of extinction, according to a new study that rings another alarm bell over the impact on biodiversity of mining the seabed. The research, led from Queen’s University in Belfast, has led to 184 mollusc species living around hydrothermal vents being added to the global red list of threatened species, compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While researchers only studied molluscs that were endemic to the vents (hot springs on the ocean floor), they said they would expect similar extinction risks for crustaceans or any other species reliant on the vents. More than 80% of the oceans remains unmapped, unobserved and unexplored, and there is increasing opposition to deep-sea mining from governments, civil society groups and scientists, who say loss of biodiversity is inevitable, and likely to be permanent if it goes ahead. “The species we studied are extremely reliant on the unique ecosystem of hydrothermal vents for their survival,” said Elin Thomas, the lead researcher. “If deep-sea mining companies want all the metals that form at the vents, they would remove all the habitat that the vent species come from. But the species have nowhere else to go.” The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body, is meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, to agree a route for finalising regulations by July 2023 that would allow the undersea mining of cobalt, nickel and other metals to go ahead. There are at least 600 known hydrothermal vents worldwide, at depths of 2,000-4,000 metres, and each are roughly a third of the size of a football pitch. They act as natural plumbing systems, transporting heat and chemicals from the Earth’s interior in massive geysers, and they also help regulate ocean chemistry. In doing so, vast – and valuable – mineral deposits accumulate at the fissures. The heat from them, on the otherwise cold seabed, also makes them biodiversity hotspots, akin to coral reefs or tropical rainforests. The paper was published in Frontiers in Marine Science and supported by Ireland’s Marine Institute. The scientists examined the regulatory framework and regional management objectives at each site, as well as exploratory mining licences. Of the 184 species assessed, 62% are listed as threatened, many in the territorial waters of countries that have granted deep-sea mining licences, such as Japan and Papua New Guinea. Only 25 species are fully protected from deep-sea mining by local conservation measures, such as in the Azores and Mexico. The extinction threat was worst in the Indian Ocean, where every species was listed as threatened and 60% as critically endangered, and where many mining exploration licences have been issued by the ISA."
"Florida wildlife officials will undertake a manatee feeding and rescue operation involving hand-feeding the mammals romaine lettuce, amid unprecedented mortality among the gentle aquatic creatures affectionately known as “sea cows”. Typically, manatees return to warm water winter feeding grounds, where they feast on plentiful seagrass. But algal blooms from polluted waters have devastated seagrass beds, and thereby wiped out the important food source for the manatees. Algal blooms and manatee deaths have been especially pronounced along Florida’s Atlantic coast, leading to record-breaking mortality. “Our agencies and Unified Command partners carefully considered all aspects of a short-term feeding trial,” said Shannon Estenoz, assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks with the federal Department of Interior, in a release. “It is critical we help manatees in the short term with actions that are compatible with their long-term wellbeing and resilience.” Normally slow-moving and plump, manatees along Florida’s east coast have shown signs of starvation, and appeared emaciated with protruding ribs. Manatee deaths have overwhelmed local rescue groups and even the ecosystem. Hundreds of manatee carcasses have had to be towed to remote islands, where they have been left to rot, the Palm Beach Post reported. “They are starving, and I see it in person,” Paul Fafeita, president of the Clean Water Coalition of Indian River county, told local television station CBS12 in Palm Beach. “I’m out there all the time. I’m witnessing it. It’s heart wrenching.” As a result, Florida and federal government wildlife officials said they would begin an operation to hand-feed manatees romaine lettuce, among other efforts. A temporary field response station is also expected to be set up in the Indian River Lagoon, on the coast near Orlando, where many deaths have occurred. The Florida state legislature increased an annual stipend for manatee rescue to $8m. Initial 2021 manatee mortality data from the state’s conservation department showed more than 1,000 manatees have died. Manatees are an endangered species. The most recent aerial survey of Florida manatee populations found only about 5,700 in Florida, according to Save the Manatee. In the last five years, an average of 500 manatees have died. By comparison in 2001, just 325 manatees were found dead, with boats among their biggest killers."
"Corals across large parts of the Great Barrier Reef could be hit by mass bleaching for the fourth time in just seven years by the end of January, according to a forecast from a United States government agency. Reef scientists are hoping that favourable weather, including cloud cover and rain or a cyclone, could yet cool corals and stave off the threat. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (Noaa) forecast shows heat accumulating in northern and central parts of the reef will be high enough for corals to start bleaching by late January. Forecasting from the Bureau of Meteorology also shows heat building over the world-heritage-listed reef in January. Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said water temperatures were currently above average “almost everywhere”, with some areas 2C warmer. He said: “The situation at the moment is not what we want, but in a world with a changed climate it’s not surprising.” He said neither the Noaa or BoM forecasts were able to predict cyclones which can quickly lower temperatures. “I wish for cloud and rain,” he said. Australia’s cyclone season is considered to run from November to April and the eastern side of the country, including the reef, gets an average of four cyclones per year. The Bureau of Meteorology says there is only a slight chance of more than the average number of cyclones this current season. A spokesperson said the bureau’s ocean outlook “is indicating increased thermal stress on the Great Barrier Reef for the remainder of the year and January 2022, reducing in February”. According to Noaa’s forecast, delivered through its Coral Reef Watch service, by the third week of January sections of the reef from just south of Airlie Beach to the tip of Cape York – a distance of about 1,300 kilometres – will likely be bleaching. By mid-February, the forecast shows large areas from Cairns upwards would be at “Alert Level 2” – the highest level of heat stress where coral mortality is considered likely. Australia’s climate is currently under the influence of a La Niña weather pattern and Wachenfeld said this would typically deliver more cloud and rain to the reef’s waters. “But we have just not seen that yet this summer. We’re hoping those typical La Niña conditions will kick in. The weather events over the next few weeks are critical.” Coral bleaching is a stress reaction from excess heat. The process sees corals separate from a special algae that gives them their colour and much of their nutrients. Corals can recover from less severe bleaching, but studies suggest those that do survive are weakened. Although 2020 was the most widespread bleaching on record, Wachenfeld said the heat levels were not as intense as previous events and so with low levels of coral mortality, the reef had been given several years to recover. The Australian Institute of Marine Science’s latest reef condition report showed 2021 was a “low disturbance year” with a rise in the amount of corals. But this increase in coral cover was dominated by weaker fast-growing species prone to bleaching. Prof Peter Mumby, of the University of Queensland, said the reef was in a critical period for recovery, but he was concerned by the Noaa forecast “particularly because they tend to be quite conservative”. “Everyone is feeling a bit depressed at the prospect of another bleaching event,” he said. Dr Selina Ward, the academic director of the University of Queensland’s Heron Island research station, said: “I’m always worried when I see temperatures go up and stay up. “This Noaa forecast suggests we’re likely to have a bleaching event and it would come earlier in the summer than we would expect.” Prof Terry Hughes, of James Cook University’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, is a coral bleaching expert who surveys the reef during bleaching events. The Great Barrier Reef has seen five mass bleaching events – 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating. One study led by Hughes in November found only 2% of individual reefs along the 2,300 kilometre system had escaped bleaching since 1998. Hughes said the Noaa forecast was unusual in that it was predicting an early onset of bleaching concentrated in the north. But he said the forecast was also suggesting a rapid reduction in heat in early March which would help corals survive. But he said historically an El Niño weather pattern – the hotter and drier alternative to La Niña – would trigger bleaching. “It’s scary that we no longer need an El Niño to trigger a mass bleaching event – we just need another heatwave, driven by global heating. “Across the tropics, average sea temperatures today during La Niña periods are hotter than they used to be during El Niños 30 years ago.” He said the Bureau of Meteorology’s forecast was “more benign” than Noaa’s, but temperatures across the reef had been about a degree above average for the past month. “With La Niña conditions building, we hope that the reef will dodge the bullet for another year,” he said. He said if northern parts of the reef did bleach again this summer, young corals that have started to grow in recent years would be at risk. Prof Tom Bridge, an ecologist and reef scientist at the Museum of Tropical Queensland, said the Noaa forecasts did not make him any more or less worried about the prospect of bleaching as any other year. “It’s now hotter every year,” he said. “Every summer now we are running this gauntlet where bleaching is dependent on the vagaries of the weather like rains and cyclones and heatwaves.” Research last month suggested parts of the reef would be hit with temperatures high enough to kill corals five years per decade by the middle of this century if global heating was kept below 2C. Science advisers at Unesco have said earlier this year the reef should be placed on a list of world heritage sites “in danger” but fierce lobbying from the Morrison government has delayed a decision until at least June next year. Coral reefs are considered one of the most susceptible ecosystems to the climate crisis. The Morrison government has been asked to send a progress report to Unesco by February next year. Unesco is yet to schedule a monitoring mission to the reef, expected in the first half of next year. On Friday, lawyers representing three young Queenslanders wrote to the 21-country world heritage committee, urging it to place the reef on the “in danger” list when it next meets in June in Russia."
"I wake to a grey haze that my brain insists is daylight – but when I check my phone it’s only 3am. I lie on, listening to a robin singing – another diurnal creature whose circadian cycle is upset by the new white LED (light emitting diode) streetlight outside my house. At 4am, I give up on sleep. Outside, other than my own footsteps, the only sound is more robin song as I walk through territory after territory. In winter, robins are one of the few avian species still singing, their ranks swollen by territorial females as well as males. Their winter song is languid and tremulous. However, approaching the glare of an LED lantern, I notice an uptick in my pace that seems to chime with a greater stridency coming from the singing robin in an adjacent sycamore. The impact of light pollution on songbirds has long been recognised, tricking the bird’s brain into thinking night is day. This is easier to hear when the dawn chorus has been winnowed to a single species – and it is no coincidence that the robin is that species. With their large eyes adapted for crepuscular activity, robins are especially sensitive to light and already one of the earliest avian risers. But it’s not just any light that awakens them. Diurnal birds respond to the blue wavelengths in sunlight, thanks to the circadian photosensitive cells in their retina (which we mammals also have). Traditional streetlights using sodium-vapour emit light at the more red end of the visible light spectrum, and are therefore of little disturbance to the dozing robin. Those streetlights are being gradually replaced by LED ones, for their energy efficiency. But in solving one problem, another has been created: these white LED lights are rich in those blue wavelengths that disturb not just songbirds but moths and bats too. It’s no wonder these robins can’t sleep. I leave the streetlights behind. I’ve reached the nocturnal cloak of Lagan Valley regional park. Stars prick into view. I tread cautiously through the mulchy dark. As shades grow into a gauze of scrub and trees, there’s not a robin to be heard. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"
"Midwinter dusk is falling as we navigate the steep maze of arms’-width alleys that pass for streets in Robin Hood’s Bay. It’s the stuff of Instagram dreams, but if you were to go back 250 years, locals had another use for the warren on their doorsteps. Back then, this tiny community was among the busiest smuggling hotspots on the North Sea coast of England. Contraband rowed ashore under the gaze of a clifftop lookout disappeared into a network of passages, interconnected houses and tunnels, including one opening directly on to the slipway. I must have been here a dozen times before my friend Jen told me that it led somewhere, and today we spring the same surprise on our children. They are initially wary. The dark, the rushing water and the smell – not foul, but dank – are not exactly inviting. It’s a bit much for the littlest, but the older two are game, first edging along a shelf on one side, then hopping rock to rock, nimble as ship rats. A short way in, a smaller tunnel opens to one side. It is steeper and rockier than the main culvert, with a beamed and boarded roof that suggests we are under a building. It would be the work of seconds to pass a packet through a lifted board, from where it could be whisked, hand to hand, house to house, to a safe hiding place. That’s how it happened. It was risky, but the profit on a single parcel of tea or silk or a bladder of Dutch gin exceeded a week’s legally earned wage, and with geology, topography and hydrology on their side, the entire community, as tight-knit as a fisherman’s gansey, was in on it. Rather than being a place built for smuggling, smugglers were made by this place. The tunnel leads out into a steep gully, its sides green with mosses, woodrush and ferns. Above, Christmas lights twinkle in the fog-furled night – close, but somehow a world distant. In the bar of the Bay Hotel later, the kids form a conspiratorial huddle. By the time we leave, the littlest has found her courage, and back to the tunnel they go, together this time, to emerge triumphant, with rebellion running hot in their veins. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"
"I thought it was a blood moon at first. The dark orange glow appeared at dusk on the far side of the shimmering silver band that is the Xingu River. It was just before 8pm, after the parrots had squawked back to their nests and the insects and frogs were noisily starting the forest nightshift. A flash of lightning from a cloud appeared above almost the same location but the rest of the sky was clear. How could there be a storm? I peered more intently and took a photograph that I could magnify. And there was the answer – a fire, which grew fiercer as I watched, the flames spreading sideways and upwards, flickering red and yellow, billowing smoke into the sky, sparking flashes of lightning every couple of minutes. I felt sick to the stomach. The Amazon rainforest was being destroyed in front of my eyes. I have been writing about the climate crisis for 16 years, always with a sense of horror but until now, mostly with a sense of distance. This was the first time I had seen it from my home, and it was stranger than I expected. I had not realised until that moment that fire can create its own lightning storms, by creating pyrocumulonimbus, which scientists describe as “the fire-breathing dragon of clouds”. There was no immediate danger – the fire was several miles away on the other side of one of the world’s biggest rivers – but it felt personal. More than 90% of fires in the Amazon are started deliberately to clear trees so the land can be used for cattle ranching or crop cultivation. That meant this arson attack against nature was almost certainly carried out by one of my neighbours. I knew it was probably illegal and that, according to climate science, it would nudge the world’s biggest rainforest that much closer to an irreversible tipping point. But there was nothing I could do except watch. The chances of anyone else lifting a finger while Jair Bolsonaro was Brazil’s president were next to zero. This was on 27 August. The next morning I learned there were several fires in the rainforest that night. In fact, this was one of the most devastating nights for the Amazon in a decade. Landowners and land-grabbers were rushing to burn with impunity before a presidential election that the polls showed was likely to result in a change of power. August, September and October were months of fire, a human-made season wedged between the driest point of summer and the onset of the winter monsoons. A haze of charred vegetation shrouded many parts of the rainforest for weeks. My asthma returned for the first time in nine months. Viewed from the forest, the contest between Bolsonaro and his main challenger, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was not about tax rises or government spending – it was life or death. Fire, guns and intimidation I moved to the Amazon last December. The journey itself was eye-opening. I travelled here with my nine-month-old dog, Frida, who wasn’t allowed on the last leg of the plane journey from Belem to Altamira so we had to do that 500-mile (800km) stretch by car along the dusty Trans-Amazonian highway. This road, the BR230, was the starting point for the past half-century of destruction. When the first section opened in 1972 the president of Brazil’s military dictatorship, Gen Emílio Garrastazu Médici, marked the occasion in Altamira by cutting down a giant Brazil nut tree to symbolise the conquest of nature. The road was designed to bring in a wave of settlers. “Land without men for men without land” was the misleading slogan of the regime, which had trampled over and often killed the Indigenous communities that had lived there for millennia. The road has since become a vector for land clearance and violence. As Frida and I passed through, I could see the bio-rich primary forest on the side of the road had been replaced by soy and cacau monocultures. The Tocantins and Xingu rivers were dammed by huge hydroelectric at Tucuruí and Belo Monte. Again and again, along the 12-hour drive, the hillsides were stripped of trees and replaced with pastures scattered with white cows. Beef consumes more of the forest than any other commodity. There are now 90 million cows in the Amazon, grazing on an area of cleared land the size of France. Few outside Brazil have heard of our destination, Altamira, but it is one of the biggest municipalities on the planet with a surface area of 160,000 sq km (62,000 sq miles), making it larger than half of the world’s countries. It is in the state of Pará, which is the main exporter of cattle and gold in the Amazon, and as a result suffers the worst deforestation and the deadliest violence. Like all frontier towns, Altamira has thrived on the destruction of nature, which has accelerated rapidly in the past five decades. Most of the land used to be covered in forest occupied by Indigenous communities, but waves of invasion have brought ever greater threats in the name of colonisation, civilisation or development. First came the Jesuit missionaries in the 18th century, followed by the rubber barons in the 19th, then the big agricultural companies and the road and dam builders in the 20th. Today, it is primarily a cowboy and mining town, with a parade each November of hundreds of ranchers riding through the streets on horseback. In the hardware store, the staff shout out greetings to recognised customers, “Hey, garimpeiro!” (Hey, gold prospector!). I remember my first visit here eight years ago to cover the construction of the Belo Monte dam, the biggest hydroelectric plant in the Amazon. “The vast construction site is like something out of Mordor – an immense wall of stone, steel and concrete that towers above a blasted plain,” I wrote at the time, when I thought, rather sniffily, “who would want to live here?” The answer, it seems, is me. To my surprise and delight, I have now lived in the rainforest for 12 months. During this time, I have learned much more intimately that, instead of living as part of nature as we should, much of humanity is now at war with it. Fire is the main weapon against the forest; guns and intimidation against its protectors, the Indigenous communities. Two friends, the land and environment activists Erasmo and Natalha Theofilo, are in hiding for the fifth time since Bolsonaro took power after multiple death threats to them and their children. Another friend, the first woman to be an Indigenous chief, Juma Xipaya, came to dinner with a bodyguard because she, too, has a price on her head after speaking out against illegal mines. The dangers were made horribly real in June when my friend and fellow journalist Dom Phillips was murdered in the Javari Valley while researching a book entitled How to Save the Amazon. He was killed alongside the Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, who was targeted because he had encouraged and trained Indigenous communities to resist illegal fishing in their territory. Dom sent encouraging messages when I arrived in Altamira and he planned to visit. Now he and Bruno are victims of a global war against nature that is almost always one-sided. I feel different about the fire now that I live here. It is not just that it feels closer. It is because I realise how much loss of life is involved. When I wrote about forest clearance from afar, I would calculate the damage in the sterile terms of carbon tonnes or real estate. But now I am surrounded by forest, I see flames as the death of trees and all the living creatures that depend on them – insects, lichen, fungi, mammals. The burn-off is not just a climate disaster, it is a mass extermination of other species. Two of Brazil’s most respected Amazon research institutes, Imazon and MapBiomas, told me that in the past four years under Bolsonaro’s watch, at least 2bn trees have been killed in the Amazon, along with up to 3.8m monkeys, while 89.9m birds and countless other species have died, been injured or lost their habitat. Destructive forces unleashed by Bolsonaro To be in the Amazon in 2022 is to live between a tipping point that humanity must avoid and a turning point that we must invent. The world’s rainforest has degraded perilously close to a stage where it can no longer regenerate. As more trees are cleared, the forest is less able to produce its own rain. It starts to dry out, to become more vulnerable to fire and lightning strikes, until it changes into another ecosystem entirely, a savannah, which is less biodiverse, less capable of storing carbon, less powerful in generating the rainfall and storms that keep weather systems moving. This is already happening along the arc of deforestation in the south and south-east Amazon, where the forest is turning to savannah as it emits more carbon than it absorbs. The rest of the rainforest is heading in the same direction: 17% has now been cleared and another 17% degraded. Scientists estimate the tipping point will occur when 20% to 25% of the Amazon is lost, which, at the current rate of ecocide, is more likely to be years rather than decades away. Being here helps me understand a little better why the forest is sacrificed. Pará is one of the poorest states in Brazil, with a per capita income half the national average, and with dire inequality. Since the opening of the Trans-Amazonian highway there have been four types of settlers in Altamira. First there is an already wealthy white elite, who were invited to migrate and given substantial landholdings on condition they started agricultural businesses that would benefit the town’s economy. Instead, many of them simply kept the property for themselves, became fazendeiros (farmers), and set about expanding their empires through illegal and often violent land grabs. The second group are white settlers from the south of Brazil who were given state support and cheap credit, which has enabled some of them to thrive. These two groups show little desire to be part of the forest, or to protect it. To them it is “the other”, either a threat or something to exploit. When they acquire a plot of land, their first step is always to “clean” it, which means destroying all traces of life with bulldozers. This creates a semi-sterile perimeter, which can be fenced off and grassed over. About 70% of this illegally cleared land is then opened up for cattle ranches. It is these two groups that thrived when Bolsonaro and his ministers gutted the forest protection and Indigenous agencies, which led to a surge of invasions by land-grabbers, illegal miners, loggers, ranchers and organised crime gangs. These are the people who trot through the streets on horseback during the annual cowboy parade. These are the customers I shop with at the hardware store, which does a booming trade in chainsaws and gold-panning equipment. These are the listeners of Sertanejo, the country music that has pushed samba and funk aside to dominate the Brazilian music industry. These are also the diehard Bolsonarists, who drive through town in their SUVs with a Brazil flag emblazoned on their bonnet. But Altamira is also a base for those seeking a turning point for social equality and the environment. The third group of residents are descendants of people from the poorer north-east of Brazil, who either arrived as rubber tappers a century ago, or took their chances when the Trans-Amazonian was opened. Many of this group are afro-Brazilians, who were given little or no state support to settle in their new homes. They either work for the wealthy or fend for themselves by farming or mining in more remote areas. Many are under the sway of the evangelical church and criminal organisations, neither of which show any inclination to value the forest. But social activists, such as Daniela Silva, and artists such as Joaka Barros and Soll, are aiming to change this by reconnecting the young from poor urban communities with nature, through rap, art and visits. They often find common cause with the fourth group: middle-class liberals from São Paulo and other cities who move to Altamira as academics, lawyers, medical professionals or conservation workers. Bold thinkers are looking for a new way of doing things. They include the human rights campaigner Antónia Melo, who led much of the resistance against the Belo Monte dam; doctors such as Erika Pellegrino, who are trying to use medicine to strengthen the remote communities who protect the forest; legal experts like Thais Santi, who are building new legal precedents of ecocide; and entrepreneurs such as Marcelo Salazar, who is searching for new business models to gather and market brazil nuts, acai, babassu oil and other sustainably produced forest products. Switching to a new model, something more natural, sustainable and fairer for future generations and other species, requires persistence and patience. That does not come easy, as I have learned in our small community, which is divided between those who are environmentally progressive and those who want to follow the path of carbon capital development that the world has been on for the past 250 years and which has brought incredible advances for human wellbeing at the expense of everything else. The argument between the two, which has manifested in several heated community meetings, is a microcosm of the directions that Brazil and the world are being pulled in. For the past four years, the farmers have had the upper hand. For anyone who cares about the Amazon, this has been a horrendous period. Bolsonaro and his ministers dismantled much of the forest protection machinery that had been built up over the previous three decades, leading to a 59.9% rise in the rate of deforestation. Meanwhile, Brazil’s congress pushed forward with a package of bills to legitimise land thefts, weaken environmental licensing of new projects, and permit mining inside Indigenous territory. Narco-trafficking gangs have expanded their presence in the forest and started supplying cocaine to remote riverside communities. Amid this moral and physical haze, the election victory of Lula was a gasp of fresh air. But can he rein back the destructive forces unleashed by Bolsonaro? It will not be easy and it will not be cheap. Tens of thousands of illegal miners will have to be relocated and retrained. The forest communities they have co-opted into land clearance, alcoholism and prostitution will need support and their traditional practices treated with more respect. The Brazilian economy, which has become ever more dependent on agriculture and mining, will need alternative ways to generate income. Lula will have to find a way to work with a hostile congress and a sceptical agricultural sector, while strengthening forest protection and Indigenous rights. All of this will require one thing that has not happened since the first European colonisers set foot on this continent – the outside world will need to value the forest more alive than dead. One way or another, this year has to be a turning point. With the fire storm on the horizon, I have seen more than enough of paradise lost. The wild abyss of the Amazon can not go on as it is. The womb of nature must not become her grave."
"For anyone who cares about the Amazon rainforest, there will be an extra reason to celebrate the new year countdown in Brazil on 31 December because the first stroke of midnight will mark the last moment in power of Jair Bolsonaro. The defeat of the ultra-right former army captain, who unleashed a wave of forest burning and river poisoning during his four years in office, was arguably the world’s best environmental news of 2022. As he is replaced by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, here are seven reasons to be cheerful about the Amazon in 2023, and three reminders of why that’s no excuse for anyone to drop their guard. 1. The only way is up Anyone would feel a relief after the firestorm that was Bolsonaro. Here is the baseline the outgoing president leaves. Data from Brazil’s space agency confirms no other leader has overseen such a sharp increase in deforestation – 59.5% over a presidential term – since satellite records began in 1988. Bolsonaro, who tried his hand at gold prospecting before he was in the army, has also overseen invasions of tens of thousands of illegal miners into the lands of the Yanomami, Munduruku, Kayapo and other Indigenous peoples, leading to violence, disease, wrecked landscapes and mercury contamination of the Amazon’s greatest waterways. His ministers trashed the government agencies responsible for protecting the forest, nature reserves and indigenous territories. Criminals enjoy a culture of impunity. Environmental fines are down 38%. The first job of the new government will be to glue back together the broken pieces of the environmental institutions Bolsonaro shattered. 2. Marina Silva is back Marina Silva was arguably the world’s most effective environment minister during the first Lula administration from 2003 to 2006. As a former rubber tapper and union activist, she struck exactly the right balance between livelihood support and nature protection. She introduced policies that led to an 80% fall in Amazon deforestation, opposed agrotoxins and biofuels, and tried to block roads, dams and other infrastructure projects that threatened important areas of nature. Her problem was that she was so effective she made powerful enemies in the construction and agriculture sectors. Lula backed them instead of her, prompting Silva’s resignation. However, she is favourite to be the next environment minister, despite lobbying against her by the agribusiness and financial sectors. As the choice of conservationists and the candidate with the strongest international profile, anyone else would be a blow to the environmental credibility of the new government. 3. Lula now gets it Or so his public speeches suggest. After the election results were announced, Lula used his victory speech to emphasise the need to fight for the environment, indigenous rights and zero deforestation by 2030. This was a big advance on his previous commitment to halt only illegal deforestation. For his first overseas trip as president-elect, he attended the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. Silva says she agreed to rejoin him because Lula now realises the severity of the climate crisis and that the old models of national development are no longer sustainable. She has persuaded him that zero deforestation goals must apply not only to the Amazon, but to other globally important biomes such as the Pantanal wetlands and the Cerrado savanna. 4. An environment ministry with more cash and muscle The transition team has asked for 536m reais (£83m) additional cash. The money would be used for field operations against illegal miners and loggers, firefighting units, and a resumption of bolsa verde (green grant) incentives for smallholders to maintain forests and rivers. In addition, the environment ministry would take back control over waterways and forest services, which were hived off to the agriculture ministry and development agency under Bolsonaro. To finance reforestation projects, the government would redirect environmental fines under a system that proved effective during the administration of Michel Temer, who was president between 2016 and 2018. The ministry also plans greater coordination with subnational governments, an important bureaucratic step that would help the federal authorities to close local loopholes. The toughest ask, however, is for 2,000 additional staff, which is essential to launch more investigations and put officers in the field. But no budget has been allocated yet for this. 5. Deforestation profiteers face penalties and prison. The new administration will have to send a strong early signal that the years of impunity are over for land grabbers. This is expected to come in the form of a mass embargo of thousands of companies and landowners involved in illegal deforestation. Silva proved the effectiveness of this last time she was environment minister by tracking down the money-men who finance Amazonian land thefts and punishing them with business embargos, credit withdrawal, blacklisting and fines. Whether or not she gets the post again, expect much more of the same between January and April. These punitive measures are much easier now because hi-tech satellite monitoring by groups such as MapBiomas can quickly and accurately tell where land is being cleared and who owns the land. There is no longer any need to put boots on the ground. Embargo notices can be automatically sent out like speeding fines. The federal police will also be tasked with investigating shell companies so the real investors – often dentists, graphic designers and car salesmen in the south of Brazil – are caught and punished. Contrary to the myth peddled by Bolsonaro, the vast majority of deforestation can be traced to a small, wealthy elite. 6. Police and the army will drive out (some) invaders One of the media blitzes in the first weeks or months of the new government will be a big operation or series of operations against illegal mining camps inside indigenous Yanomami, Munduruku or Kayapo territory. Expect Hollywood-esque images of forest protection agents swooping down in military helicopters, rounding up criminals, and then burning all the equipment in sight. Again, this will be largely about sending signals. A real solution will take much more time and be much more complex because illegal mining camps are scattered all over the Amazon, often co-opt Indigenous people and will leave thousands of poor, untrained people out of work and in need of relocation and state support to start different lives. All of this will signal the state is back in the Amazon. And the Amazon will be more in the state than before thanks to the creation of an Indigenous ministry, which is likely to be headed by Sônia Guajajara. 7. The outside world has started to step up The fate of the rainforest is not decided in the Amazon, but in the overseas markets that buy its beef, wood, soy and iron ore. So another piece of good news in 2022 was the European Union’s decision to adopt new regulations on deforestation-free trade. The new rules impose strict traceability requirements on forest products and will block those that are sourced in areas of unsustainable deforestation or degradation. This is a big step forward from the previous approach, which relied on voluntary actions, and it is hoped the Amazon’s two other main customers – China and the United States – will adopt similar measures. Brazilian beef and soy companies would then have a strong incentive to increase productivity by rehabilitating degraded land rather than by clearing forest. Add to this the new global deal on biodiversity just agreed in Montreal, which promises $30bn (£25bn) to ensure 30% of nature is protected by 2030, and it looks likely the Amazon will be getting more support from outside. More important still is for overseas campaigners to continue to put pressure on Brazil to maintain high environmental standards. This will help Lula in the coming battles with the agriculture lobby and dam builders. All of this is likely to result in a substantial drop in Amazon deforestation next year, although it will not show up fully in the annual results until 2024. However, this is not guaranteed and the situation remains perilous. Here are three sobering reminders why a change of government is not enough by itself to save the planet’s greatest concentration of terrestrial life. 1. Dangerous divisions Splits inside Brazil make everything more difficult and dangerous. Lula’s election victory by just 1.8 percentage points shows the split in national opinion, and in Congress, Bolsonaristas made major gains. Pushing through budgets and legislation will be difficult without compromising with the powerful ruralista caucus of agribusiness-backed politicians, some of whom supported Lula and will expect favours in return. The right wing, meanwhile, will continue to push existing bills that aim to legitimise earlier land grabs, weaken environmental licensing and permit mining in indigenous land. Some of the fiercest opposition is in Amazonian towns on the “arc of deforestation”, where loggers and ranchers have blocked roads. In Roraima, where the brutal invasion of Yanomami land by illegal miners has taken place, most of the local population are directly or indirectly dependent on gold and opposed to federal moves to restore the territory to its Indigenous owners. There will be violence. There will be protests. There may also be deaths. Hopefully there will also be support and alternatives for those forced to relocate. 2. Markets remain invested in death The Amazon will never be safe while trees are worth more dead than alive. That is still the case. Commodity markets put a far greater value on forest products, such as beef, gold, timber, soy and iron-ore, than they do on the forest itself. There have been efforts to change this through carbon credits and ecosystem service payments that recognise and price the role of the forest in absorbing CO2, pumping water across the skies and providing a habitat for biodiversity. Soon after Lula takes power, Norway and Germany will resume channelling hundreds of millions of euros through the Amazon Fund, which can help to pay for increased forest protection, but most wealthy nations are reluctant to pay for something they have taken for granted for centuries. The spigot of international funds needs to open much wider or old extractivist-capitalist incentives will tilt people towards fire rather than conservation. But it is easily affordable if it is made a priority. To get a sense of current priorities, Britain wasted £8bn on poorly planned or price-inflated personal protective equipment during the Covid pandemic. That is 15 times more than the entire Amazon Fund, which is the biggest international effort to save a globally essential ecosystem. 3. Time is running out Even under Lula, Brazil – like almost every other country in the world – is not acting with sufficient urgency. Scientists warn the Amazon is close to a tipping point, after which the humid, biodiverse rainforest will not be able to recover and it will degrade instead into a dry savanna. That calamity is said to strike when deforestation is between 20 and 25%. The cleared area now is 17% with another 17% degraded, so this point is close. In some areas it has already arrived: droughts are growing longer, trees are more vulnerable to fire and so the forest emits more carbon than it absorbs, turning it from a climate friend to a climate foe. Given this worsening calamity, the Amazon crisis is far more critical than when Lula was last in power. Yet most of the work done by his transition team has been focused on rebuilding the capacity that was lost under Bolsonaro rather than adding new measures that take account of the increased danger. There are more ambitious steps that could be pushed by Brazil, such as a major reforestation programme and a moratorium on beef from deforested land. But the real urgency has to come from outside, and be joined with real money. If not, Lula will simply slow the arrival of Amazonian collapse, rather than prevent it."
"European gas prices have dipped to a level last seen before Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February, after warmer weather across the continent eased concerns over shortages. The month-ahead European gas future contract dropped as low as €76.78 per megawatt hour on Wednesday, the lowest level in 10 months, before closing higher at €83.70, according to Refinitiv, a data company. The invasion roiled global energy markets and forced European countries, including industrial powerhouse Germany, to look for alternative suppliers to those funding the Kremlin. Europe had continued to rely on Russian gas even after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. On Tuesday 83.2% of EU gas storage was filled, data from industry body Gas Infrastructure Europe showed. The EU in May set a target of filling 80% of its gas storage capacity by the start of November to prepare for winter. It hit that target in August, and by mid-November it had peaked at more than 95%. Gas prices bounced further off the 10-month low on Thursday to reach €85.50 per megawatt hour. Europe has several months of domestic heating demand ahead, and some industry bosses believe energy shortages could also be a problem next winter. However, traders have also had to weigh the effects of recessions expected in several big European economies, which could dent energy demand. UK gas prices have also dropped back from their highs earlier this year. The day-ahead gas price closed at 155p per therm on Wednesday, compared with 200p/therm at the start of 2022, and more than 500p/therm in August. Europe’s response to the prospect of gas shortages also included campaigns to reduce energy use – a strategy belatedly adopted by the UK – and windfall taxes on energy companies to help raise revenues for governments, many of which have started expensive subsidies to cushion the impact of high energy prices for households and consumers. Energy companies have enjoyed huge profits at the expense of businesses and households this year as prices surged but costs remained much the same. However, the US oil company ExxonMobil on Wednesday launched a legal challenge against EU plans for a windfall tax on oil companies, according to filings by its German and Dutch subsidiaries at the European general court in Luxembourg. ExxonMobil argued that the windfall tax would be “counter-productive” because it said it would result in lower investment in fossil fuel extraction, and that the EU did not have the legal jurisdiction to impose it. ExxonMobil’s move has prompted anger among European politicians. A message posted on the Twitter account of Paolo Gentiloni, the EU’s commissioner for the economy, on Thursday stated: “Fairness and solidarity, even for corporate giants. #Exxon.” Oil prices are significantly lower than they were before the start of Russia’s invasion, and only marginally above where they were at the start of 2022. Brent crude oil futures traded at $100 a barrel on 28 February, but were at $81.84 on Thursday. Oil prices dropped by 1.7% on Thursday. Prices had risen from 12-month lows in early December as traders hoped for increased demand from China after it relaxed its coronavirus restrictions. However, Covid-19 infection numbers are thought to have surged in the country, prompting the US to require travellers from China to show a negative test for the disease and tempering expectations for a rapid increase in oil demand."
"Special forces war veterans are being deployed undercover to help tackle the increasingly violent criminal networks moving into fly-tipping and the dumping of dangerous waste. Former SAS and special reconnaissance regiment (SRR) service personnel, who specialise in surveillance and “close-target” reconnaissance and who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, are being drafted in to collect evidence against organised crime groups that use collusion, corruption and the threat of violence to profit from environmental offences. Criminal networks are increasingly exploiting the waste industry in massive fraud and fly-tipping schemes involving household recycling and the dumping or burying of toxic and dangerous substances to evade landfill charges and other taxes. Security specialist the Subrosa Group, which is hired by councils and waste management companies to crack down on such offences, said it now employed a full-time unit of former special forces “surveillance operatives” to tackle environmental crime, amid concern there was such little government action in the area that such offences were effectively becoming decriminalised. A senior manager at Subrosa, who asked to be anonymous for security reasons, said covert teams were “secreted in the undergrowth” around waste sites along with cameras hidden in rocks, planks of wood and traffic cones to document criminal behaviour. Subrosa’s chief executive, Niall Burns, added that experience of clandestine operations in conflict zones, like building covert hides to monitor enemy movements, was ideal for tracking criminal networks engaged in waste crime. “They bring all those military skills of building hides in hostile environments into this commercial world,” he said. “They [the criminals] come out with new ideas all the time, they’ve got the money, they’ve got the resources, they’ve got the wherewithal. We need to act radically in order to build a case against them.” Any gathered evidence is passed to police and prosecutors, and has resulted in a number of convictions. Attracted by significant profits but also paltry fines if caught, organised criminal networks are increasingly taking advantage of measures such as the landfill tax, which was introduced to encourage recycling but has actually increased incentives to fly-tip. Recent analysis by the National Audit Office reveals how criminal networks are moving into the sector. Of 60 organised crime groups monitored for environmental offences in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 70% were also involved in specialist money laundering and two-thirds in the drugs trade. More than half were engaged in “violent criminal activity” and a quarter involved in “organised immigration crime and human trafficking”. Burns added: “Individuals who might have once been armed bank robbers are the type going into waste crime. There’s a lot of reward for less risk.” The deployment of former special forces against waste crime, some of whom served in a plainclothes surveillance unit created for operations in Northern Ireland, follows claims that the government is not doing enough to tackle a crime worth about £1bn a year in England. The Commons public accounts committee recently described the government’s attitude to waste crime as “close to decriminalisation” because fines were so low. MPs warned that organised criminals viewed the relatively minuscule fines as a business expense. However, an Environment Agency spokesperson said it was “determined to disrupt and stop criminal waste activity through tough enforcement action and prosecution”. They added: “We now share intelligence on criminals with our partners, resulting in more than 2,500 illegal waste sites being shut down permanently in the last three years.” However, Burns said that corruption and collusion were endemic in the trade, with criminals often using insider help at waste depots in a similar way that drugs syndicates paid officials in ports for turning a blind eye or assistance in helping shipments navigate security. One of the most lucrative forms of waste crime is “misdescription”, taking advantage of different tax rates for the disposal of different materials in landfill sites. A lower tax – currently just over £3 a tonne – applies to less polluting materials, such as soil, compared to almost £99 a tonne for household residual waste. Using collusion and corruption at a landfill site, wrongly labelling the waste gives criminals a huge profit at the expense of long-term damage to the environment. With some sites receiving more than 200 lorries a day, each holding up to 40 tonnes, the scope for making money is obvious. The Environment Agency added that its joint unit for waste crime, which incorporates organisations such as the National Crime Agency, was making inroads into the gangs. “Since its inception in 2020, the unit has worked with more than 102 partner agencies and taken part in 175 days of action which have resulted in 51 arrests.”"
"Governments appear to have signed a once-in-a-decade deal to halt the destruction of Earth’s ecosystems, but the agreement seems to have been forced through by the Chinese president, ignoring the objections of some African states. After more than four years of negotiations, repeated delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic and talks into the night on Sunday in Montreal, nearly 200 countries – but not the US or the Vatican – signed an agreement at the biodiversity Cop15, which was co-hosted by Canada and China, to put humanity on a path to living in harmony with nature by the middle of the century. In an extraordinary plenary that began on Sunday evening and lasted for more than seven hours, countries wrangled over the final agreement. Finally, at about 3.30am local time on Monday, news broke that an agreement had been struck. The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s negotiator appeared to block the final deal presented by China, telling the plenary that he could not support the agreement in its current form because it did not create a new fund for biodiversity, separate to the existing UN fund, the global environment facility (GEF). China, Brazil, Indonesia, India and Mexico are the largest recipients of GEF funding, and some African states wanted more money for conservation as part of the final deal. However, moments later, China’s environment minister and the Cop15 president, Huang Runqiu, signalled that the agreement was finished and agreed, and the plenary burst into applause. Negotiators from Cameroon, Uganda and the DRC expressed incredulity that the agreement had been put through. The DRC said it had formally objected to the agreement, but a UN lawyer said it had not. The negotiator from Cameroon called it “a fraud”, while Uganda said there had been a “coup d’état” against the Cop15. Amid plummeting insect numbers, acidifying oceans filled with plastic waste, and the rampant overconsumption of the planet’s resources as humanity’s population grows wealthier and soars past 8 billion, the agreement, if implemented, could signal major changes to farming, business supply chains and the role of Indigenous communities in conservation. The deal was negotiated over two weeks and includes targets to protect 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade, reform $500bn (£410bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies, and restore 30% of the planet’s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. Governments also agreed urgent actions to halt human-caused extinctions of species known to be under threat and to promote their recovery. The deal follows scientific warnings that humans are causing the start of Earth’s sixth mass extinction event, the largest loss of life since the time of the dinosaurs. Canada’s Steven Guilbeault, a former environmental campaigner turned minister, said the Kunming-Montreal pact was a “bold step forward to protect nature”. “Just six months ago, we didn’t know if we were going to even be able to have this conference and or even less to be able to adopt this historic document. And this was only possible through the collaboration of all countries present here tonight,” he said. Governments have never met a target they have set for themselves on nature in previous decades, and the Montreal-Kunming agreement has been the subject of a major push to change the years of failure, apathy and environmental destruction. In echoes of last month’s Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, divisions over money were the main sticking point in the final hours of negotiations. EU member states, the UK and other countries from the global north pushed for ambitious conservation targets in the final text, with co-hosts Canada saying that the success of the summit depended on the headline target to protect 30% of Earth by the end of the decade for nature, known as 30 by 30. Countries from the global south, including Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – mega-diverse countries home to the world’s three largest rainforests – wanted governments to agree to the creation of a new biodiversity fund as part of the Montreal pact to pay for new conservation targets. In the final agreement, countries decided to create a new fund within the UN’s main existing biodiversity financing mechanism – the global environment facility – and commit to future talks about a separate fund. Rich countries agreed to provide $30bn of aid for biodiversity by the end of the decade, believed to be a substantial increase on current levels. Although the Montreal-Kunming agreement is not legally binding, governments will be tasked with showing their progress on meeting the targets with national biodiversity plans, akin to nationally determined contributions, which countries use to show progress on meeting the Paris climate agreement. Observers expressed disappointment at the weaker-than-hoped-for language on consumption and pesticide use, both significant drivers of biodiversity loss. The term “nature positive”, which some scientists had said would be the biodiversity equivalent of “net zero”, did not appear in the agreement. Alongside the nature targets, countries reached a historic agreement to develop a financial mechanism for sharing the benefits from drug discoveries, vaccines and food products that come from digital forms of biodiversity, known as digital sequence information or DSI, after rows about biopiracy in the lead-up to Cop15.

"Wharfedale is dreaming of the ice age again. The shape of the glacier that once scraped its way through the valley is recreated in the form of a river of cold cloud that, for today at least, has eradicated 10,000 years of human civilisation. Everything below the 200-metre contour is lost under the blanket of freezing fog, but the tops of the surrounding hills and moors poke free, and from Beamsley Beacon I look out across an archipelago of upland islands above an ocean of cloud. The “sea” has momentarily obliterated the pastoral patchwork of the valley below, the villages, the Augustinian abbeys, the A59; Leeds and Bradford, to the south-east, have been swamped too. These “cloud inversion” conditions are fuel for the imagination, and I daydream about the many strange pasts of this landscape. I contemplate the world of about 400m years ago, long before dinosaurs or flowers, where the silt and mud of a vast tropical delta would eventually become the region’s underlying millstone grit rock. But just 30,000 years ago, a geological eye-blink, this landscape would have been another alien world: a hostile wilderness of vast ice leviathans, whose legacy is still vividly evident in the contours of the land. By the time I walk back down into the valley, the fog has dissipated. By the River Wharfe, a flash of brilliant white against the high-level grey cloud catches my eye. A little egret emerges from behind a bridge and flies in a wide loop above me. These beautiful white herons are relatively new winter residents on this stretch of the Wharfe. The cold day belies that this is a bird of warm and tropical climates, and its colonisation of Britain over the last 30 years – although welcome – is a sign of our own era’s profound climate shift. Our world is separated from the last ice age by a global temperature difference of 5C. The IPCC’s current reasonable worst-case scenario predicts a possible rise of 4.4C by 2100. The glaciers are still on their long retreat, but a new world is coming towards us. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"
"The annual ride on the ferris wheel of the seasons was approaching its lowest point: the winter solstice, the shortest day. Dank preceding days of fog, relentless rain, mud and dawn-to-dusk grey skies brought the temptation to curl up on the sofa and enjoy nature vicariously through the pages of a good book. But then a north-westerly Arctic wind delivered today’s crystalline frost, frozen puddles and blue skies. A shivering, brisk-walking sort of day, until a small flock of birds had me frozen to the spot. Long-tailed tits, a dozen or more, bounding along the hedgerow in my direction. A troupe of avian acrobats, searching every twig for food morsels, never still for a second, like excited schoolchildren on a class outing. Soon they were all around, oblivious to my presence, so close I could hear the rustling of wings and soft contact calls. Could there be a more heartening end to a year than to be surrounded by these hyperactive balls of fluffy pink, grey, black and white feathers? One bird, so close I could have reached out and touched it, dangled upside down, holding on with one leg while it picked out something lodged between the toes of the other, before moving on to join the flock. There’s an anthropocentric temptation to interpret all that frenetic energy as exuberance. Really, it stems from their dire need to find enough food to survive. After they’d gone, I looked for what they might have been seeking on those lichen-covered twigs. A five-minute search yielded only a small spider, a couple of aphids and what might have been insect eggs – meagre fare in these short, freezing days of winter. There was something else, uplifting, in that blackthorn hedge: four seasons on a single winter twig. A few purple sloes, the product of flowers pollinated nine months ago, some lemon-yellow autumn leaves still clinging on and, among them, tiny, tight clusters of flower buds; spring pre-packaged, ready for warmer, longer days when this hedge will be white with blossom, not frost. The ferris wheel of the seasons slows but never stops, and will soon be picking up speed again as the days lengthen after the solstice. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"
"As global heating escalates, the US government has set out a plan to further study the controversial and seemingly sci-fi notion of deflecting the sun’s rays before they hit Earth. But a growing group of scientists denounces any steps towards what is known as solar geoengineering. The White House has set into motion a five-year outline for research into “climate interventions”. Those include methods such as sending a phalanx of planes to spray reflective particles into the upper reaches of the atmosphere, in order to block incoming sunlight from adding to rising temperatures. The work is required by Congress. It is “not new research, but a report that highlights some of the key knowledge gaps and recommendations of priority topics for relevant research”, said a spokesperson for the White House’s office of science and technology policy, adding Joe Biden’s administration wants “effective and responsible CO2 removal” as well as deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. Several American researchers, somewhat reluctantly, want to explore options to tinker with the climate system to help restrain runaway global heating, even as they acknowledge many of the knock-on risks aren’t fully known. “Until recently, I thought it was too risky, but slow progress on cutting emissions has increased motivation to understand techniques at the margins like solar geoengineering,” said Chris Field, who chaired a National Academies of Sciences report last year that recommended at least $100m being spent researching the issue. “I don’t think we should deploy it yet and there are still a ton of concerns, but we need to better understand it,” Field said. “Climate change is causing widespread impacts, it’s costing lives and wrecking economies. We are in a tough position; we are running out of time, so it’s important we know more.” Previous attempts at running experiments for what is known as solar radiation management (SRM) have faced staunch opposition. Last year, an exploratory flight in Sweden of a high-altitude SRM balloon, led by Harvard University researchers, was halted after objections by environmentalists and Indigenous leaders. But at least one US startup is now hoping to leap ahead with solar geoengineering. Make Sunsets, backed by two venture capital funds, launched in October. It claims to have already run two internal test flights for its plan to inject sulphur via balloons into the stratosphere, more than 20km above the Earth’s surface. The venture, named after the deep red sunsets that would occur if particles were seeded into the stratosphere, says its “shiny clouds” will “prevent catastrophic global warming” and help save millions of lives. “Any human-caused release of carbon dioxide is geoengineering,” it argues on its website, which asks people to buy “cooling credits” to fund its work. “We screwed up the atmosphere, and now we have a moral obligation to fix things!” Edward Parson, an expert in environmental law at University of California, Los Angeles, says Make Sunsets’ claims that it could return the world to its pre-industrial temperature for just $50bn a year are “absurd”. He explains that most researchers are wary of deploying what they consider to be a desperate, last-ditch option. But Parson says the risks in researching solar geoengineering have been overblown and that the US “is probably the bold leader on this. It would be a big step forward if we have a research program.” “In my opinion, the probability that a nation makes a serious effort on solar geoengineering over the next 30 years is about 90%,” he adds. “As impacts get much worse and if mitigation doesn’t massively increase, I judge it quite likely that some major nation considers its citizens are suffering climate harms that are intolerable.” This prospect horrifies opponents of solar geoengineering. An open letter signed by more than 380 scientists demands a global non-use agreement for SRM; it also says that growing calls for research in this area are a “cause for alarm”, due to an unknown set of ramifications that will have varying consequences in different parts of the world and could scramble “weather patterns, agriculture and the provision of basic needs of food and water”. Frank Biermann, an expert in global governance at Utrecht University, said he’s also disturbed that solar geoengineering will create a sort of moral hazard where governments ease off efforts to cut emissions and fossil fuel companies use it as cover to continue business as usual. Planet-heating emissions are expected to hit a record high this year, even though they must halve this decade if the world is to avoid dangerous levels of global heating. “I would say the majority of scientists believe this is a crazy idea for a variety of reasons,” said Biermann, who thinks the US is an outlier because of its own large per-capita emissions and inconsistent adherence to global agreements. “Soon, everyone who is dependent on coal, oil and gas will jump on the solar engineering bandwagon and say, ‘we can continue for 40 years with fossil fuels’ now. This debate threatens to derail current climate policies. It’s a huge risk.” Biermann likens research on blocking sunlight to the satirical movie Don’t Look Up, in which researchers who warn of a catastrophic incoming meteoroid are sidelined in favor of an outlandish plan to deal with it. “The only way to find out whether this works is to do it to the whole planet for several years,” he said. “I mean will 8 billion people sit there in our living rooms having our last meal waiting and hoping that elite western universities got it right, that the Americans will not mess it up?” There isn’t any international governance around solar geoengineering for now. Critics fret that unilateral action to alter the climate could spark conflict if one part of the world benefits, while another suffers knock-on droughts or floods. Also, the addition of aerosols would have to be continuous to maintain the cooling – any disruption, either intentional or otherwise, would cause a sort of “termination shock”, where bottled up warming would be unleashed in a disastrously rapid jolt. “Termination shock terrifies me,” said Lili Fuhr, a climate and energy expert at the Center for International Environmental Law. “This is just a gigantic gamble with the systems that sustain life on Earth. It could be weaponized, it could be misused – imagine if, say, India and Pakistan disagreed over one of them doing this. “We need to do more than just emissions cuts and I wish we had a magical fix to this, but this doesn’t turn bad ideas into good ones,” Fuhr adds. The idea of recalibrating the world’s climate to deal with heat-trapping emissions isn’t new. A group of scientific advisers to Lyndon Johnson cautioned the US president about global heating in 1965, musing that “deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes therefore need to be thoroughly explored”. Calls for intervention have grown in recent years as countries continue to dawdle over emissions cuts and as an internationally agreed limit of 1.5C of global heating over pre-industrial times looms into view. There are several types of proposed geoengineering, such as pumping a mist of salt water into clouds to make them more reflective of sunlight, or to place ice particles in high-altitude clouds to stop them trapping so much of the heat that bounces off Earth. The most high-profile method, though, is firing a reflective substance such as sulphur or chalk dust from nozzles into the stratosphere, where the particles would then circulate around the world and start deflecting the sun’s rays. David Keith, professor of applied physics and of public policy at Harvard, estimates that around 2m tons of sulphur a year, injected via a fleet of about 100 high-flying aircraft, would cool the planet by around 1C, around the amount it has heated up since the Industrial Revolution. All of this would cost several billion dollars a year according to an estimate, and provide a relatively quick drop in temperatures. Keith argues it is more compelling than various carbon capture technologies that can take a long time and involve complex, expensive infrastructure. “Pretending that climate change can be solved with emissions cuts alone is a dangerous fantasy,” Keith has stated. The basic physics of doing this is well understood, Parson said, likening it to the huge eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, an event that expelled nearly 20m tons of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere and caused global temperatures to drop temporarily by about 0.5C. “Most people didn’t notice that and there have been studies since that give us confidence it can be done,” said Parson. “We don’t know how it should be done, yet, and the environmental aspects and the governance remain concerns. It would be reckless to just start deploying this now but we have lost so many easy paths to limit the harms of climate change that we only face worse options.” Spraying sulphur into the skylight of the Earth could deplete the ozone layer, some have suggested, and perhaps make the sky a milky white color. Other effects on regional weather are more uncertain, to the extent one recent novel based on the topic, The Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson, depicted India embarking upon solar geoengineering to save itself from deadly heatwaves while another, Termination Shock by Neal Stephenson, conversely had India sabotaging a sulphur deployment system in Texas because it interfered with its monsoon. The debate over how much we should meddle with the climate is likely to intensify as the fallout from global heating worsens. For now, opponents won’t back down. To Biermann, solar geoengineering should be considered by governments as being akin to landmines or biological weapons and blacklisted internationally. “This is just another one on this list,” he said. “People talk about the freedom of research, but you don’t have the freedom to sit in your back yard and develop a chemical bomb.”"
"Electricity generated by burning native forest wood waste will no longer be allowed to be classified as renewable energy under a regulatory change adopted by the Albanese government. The decision, which Labor had promised to consider after it was recommended by a Senate committee in September, reverses a 2015 Abbott government move which allowed burning native forest timber to be counted alongside solar and wind energy towards the national renewable energy target. The right to burn wood left over from logging to create renewable energy certificates – which provide a subsidy for clean energy generation – was not often used, but conservation groups said it could be an incentive to keep felling native forests. They expressed concern that some power plant owners had plans to start using native forest timber as a supplement to coal-fired generation. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the change was in step with “strong and longstanding community views” raised in a consultation process that received more than 2,900 submissions. He said the government had put in place “transitional arrangements” for one Western Australian facility that had registered to use timber as an energy source. “We have listened to the community and acted to address their concerns,” he said. The Greens’ forests spokesperson, Janet Rice, described the decision as “a major win for the climate, for native forests, and for clean energy”, and said the minor party had secured a commitment the government would reconsider the practice during negotiations over climate change legislation earlier this year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Burning wood from native forests for energy is a disaster for the environment,” Rice said. “Pretending it was renewable was ludicrous. The Greens fought hard to end this farce, and we’re glad that the government has worked with us and listened to the community who campaigned hard to end this absurdity.” Conservationists welcomed the announcement. Christine Milne, a former Greens leader and now patron of the Bob Brown Foundation, said it restored a decision that she, Brown and the Greens had first secured as part of a deal with the Gillard government a decade ago on a clean energy package. “This decision will buoy the conservation community by providing some hope that the government is starting to listen to the climate and biodiversity science,” she said. “This announcement is a first step towards forest conservation.” Suzanne Harter, a climate campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said wood burning should never have been included in the definition of renewable energy. “Eastern Australia was recently highlighted as a global deforestation hotspot. Government policies should not encourage further deforestation,” she said. The Australian Forest Products Association said the government had “bowed to pressure from anti-forestry groups”. “Australia should not close the door to a dispatchable renewable energy source that is widely used around the world at a time when we need more renewable energy sources,” the association’s chief executive, Ross Hampton, said. The native forestry has been under increasing economic and environmental pressure across the country. In Victoria, a landmark supreme court judgment last month found the state logging company, VicForests, had failed to protect threatened glider species and that its methods to check for them before logging were inadequate. It has raised further doubts over whether the native forest logging industry will remain viable in the state until a promised government-ordered phase out in 2030. In WA, native forest logging is due to end in 2024. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, signalled last week the government wanted to work with the states to ensure new national environmental standards it has promised to introduce would be applied to regional forestry agreements, a step that could end an effective exemption for state-sanctioned logging from national environment laws."
"There has never been a legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor, lawyers for a landowner have argued in an attempt to overturn the ability for people to sleep on his property – and the whole national park. Despite an assumed right for decades, enshrined under both the 1949 National Park and Access to the Countryside Act and the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, a barrister acting for Alexander Darwall, a hedge fund manager, argued that no such right exists as camping is not explicitly mentioned in these laws and does not count as outdoor recreation. In the high court in London on Tuesday, Darwall was represented by the leading real estate barrister Timothy Morshead KC, who recently won a case against eco-activists trying to disrupt an aviation fuel pipeline. The Dartmoor Commons Act says anyone can access the common on foot or horseback, for the purposes of outdoor recreation, as long as they are not causing harm or damage to the land. Morshead argued this did not include camping, telling the court: “We are not suggesting that people cannot stop to picnic”. He said there were a range of permitted activities which went along with outdoor recreation, such as sitting on the ground to rest, enjoying the view or walking a dog. But added: “However long that list of permitted activities could be, it could not include camping.” He told the court that allowing people to camp without a landowner’s consent would be a “deprivation of the ability to decide who should and should not camp on one’s land” and added that those camping have caused nuisance and litter. The judge hearing the case, Sir Julian Flaux, the chancellor of the high court, interjected that in the landowner’s submission it suggests that post-pandemic this problem has become more “irritating” for landowners. Morshead agreed, adding: “Facts have developed on the ground that suggest this is a trend now.” But Timothy Leader, representing the Dartmoor National Park, said there were ways to tackle this without overturning the right to wild camp, including cooperating with the National Parks Authority (NPA) to enforce bylaws on litter and nuisance, or to take trespass claims against people who have failed to comply with the act, for example, by causing damage. He argued that for decades the law had been understood to enable wild camping – and that newcomers to Dartmoor should not try to overturn this right. He pointed out that the relevant acts were put in place 36 and 72 years ago respectively, adding: “One is struck by the level of acceptance to the approach … that wild camping has been an accepted part of Dartmoor in all of that time.” Leader said wild camping was a form of open-air recreation, positing that a “backpacker who walks on to Dartmoor to take a long walk lasting more than a day, as many do, will be a person accessing the commons on foot, they will be doing so for the purposes of recreation.”. Newcomers to Dartmoor should not be trying to overturn traditions, he said. “The NPA, ramblers, campers and others should be able to continue all their affairs on that basis without somebody such as the claimants coming in and saying: ‘We are newcomers, we don’t like that approach, we would rather that a novel approach was taken.’” One of the points under discussion was whether the way people had for decades interpreted the law meant that that was what the law was. Flaux interjected to point out: “The fact that people may have wild camped on the moor … without seeking permission from the landlords does not in itself mean the statute has the meaning which you contend.” Leader said the law does not prohibit camping, and in both the acts there are lists of unacceptable uses of the land, for example lighting fires and causing damage to fences, and that it is “impossible without straining the language to breaking point to arrive at the conclusion that the words, read plainly with their ordinary meaning, convey any restriction on camping at all. And if it’s suggested that they do then doubtless my learned friend in reply will indicate how that is.” He said the landowner’s lawyers were conflating normal camping with wild camping. “Wild camping, or backpacking, is a form of camping which involves a person carrying all they need in a rucksack and camping ‘off grid’ without access to any of the formal facilities that are found on a traditional camp site. This form of recreation has been enjoyed on Dartmoor for over 100 years. It is very different to camping in family-sized tents or in camper vans and motor homes, which on Dartmoor are directed to designated or registered sites.” James Pavey, a partner of Irwin Mitchell LLP, said on behalf of the couple: “Mr and Mrs Darwall are asking for clarification from the court for practical reasons relating to responsible land management of Dartmoor. “This matter ultimately concerns the willingness of Dartmoor National Park Authority to cooperate with land managers.”"
"A new draft climate agreement released at the Cop28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates has for the first time explicitly called on nations to transition away from fossil fuels to avert the worst impacts of the climate crisis. But the latest proposed text, released by the Cop president, Sultan Al Jaber, early on Wednesday, did not include an explicit commitment to phase out or phase down fossil fuels, as many countries, civil society groups and scientists have urged. Instead, it called on countries to contribute to global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems “in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science”. The release of the proposed compromise followed a fraught 36 hours of negotiations after Al Jaber released a draft which was roundly rejected by rich and poor countries, who described it as “grossly insufficient”, “incoherent” and a “death certificate” for low-lying and vulnerable nations. The new proposal said countries recognised “the need for deep, rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5C pathways”, and called for a tripling of global renewable energy capacity by 2030. It repeated language agreed at previous summits calling on nations to accelerate efforts “towards the phase-down of unabated coal power”. It also called for the development of a list of “zero- and low-emission technologies” including “renewables, nuclear, abatement and removal technologies such as carbon capture and utilisation and storage, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, and low-carbon hydrogen production”. The draft is meant to reflect the consensus view of nearly 200 countries gathered at the conference in Dubai, where scores of governments have insisted on strong language to signal an eventual end to the fossil fuel era against protests from Saudi Arabia and members of the oil producing group OPEC. Country representatives have been called to what the Cop28 presidency hopes is a final meeting later Wednesday morning, where they could pass the deal and end two weeks of tough negotiations that have run a day into overtime. Norway’s minister for climate and the environment, Espen Barth Eide, was among the first to react, saying the new draft was the first time that the world had united around “such a clear text on the need to transition away from fossil fuels”. “It has been the elephant in the room, at last we address it head on,” he said. The Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), a bloc of 39 countries, said the second draft was an improvement and reflected a number of their submissions, but still contained “a litany of loopholes”. “Our world’s window to keeping 1.5 alive is rapidly closing, and we feel the text does not provide the necessary balance to strengthen global action for course correction on climate change,” it said in a statement. “Aosis has been very clear that the global stocktake must be the vehicle for delivery of course correction, yet it sputters in significant areas … We must note the text does not speak specifically to fossil fuel phaseout and mitigation in a way that is in fact the step change that is needed. It is incremental and not transformational.” Mohamed Adow, from Power Shift Africa, said it was the “first time in three decades of climate negotiations the words fossil fuels have ever made it into a Cop outcome”. “The genie is never going back into the bottle and future Cops will only turn the screws even more on dirty energy,” he said. But while this sent a strong signal, he said there were still too many loopholes “on unproven and expensive technologies like carbon capture and storage, which fossil fuel interests will try and use to keep dirty energy on life support”. Adow said the text was missing the climate finance need to help developing countries decarbonise, and there needed to be a greater expectation that rich fossil fuel producers acted first. “Some people may have had their expectations for this meeting raised too high, but this result would have been unheard of two years ago, especially at a Cop meeting in a petrostate. It shows that even oil and gas producers can see we’re heading for a fossil free world,” he said. Rachel Cleetus, from the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the text sent a strong signal that world leaders recognised the need for a sharp turn away from fossil fuels towards clean energy in this decade, aligned with scientific warnings. “The finance and equity provisions, however, are seriously insufficient and must be improved in the time ahead in order to ensure low- and middle-income countries can transition to clean energy and close the energy poverty gap,” she said. Deals struck at UN climate summits must be passed by consensus, at which point individual countries are responsible for delivering on the agreements through national policies and investments. Al Jaber had earlier engaged in an intense round of shuttle diplomacy throughout Tuesday and had meetings with heads of delegation singly and in groups planned until 3am on Wednesday. Climate justice advocates have told the Guardian that rich countries have failed to show the leadership necessary to solve the climate crisis, and many are too mired in their own hypocrisy over fossil fuels to break the impasse at Cop28, Saudi Arabia and a few allied countries were in a small minority that had publicly raised strong objections to the inclusion of any reference to reducing the production and consumption of fossil fuels in the text of a potential deal. Many developed countries have publicly pushed hard for a phase-out of coal, oil and gas – but with caveats such as “unabated” or just coal, in the case of the US. In contrast, many in the developing world – despite their desire to see global temperatures limited to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – say any commitment to phasing out fossil fuels must be “fair, funded, and fast”, with the rich polluting countries transitioning first."
"Two years ago, when the former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison gave in to diplomatic pressure and turned up at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, the story of Australia’s response to the climate crisis was straightforward. There wasn’t one. Morrison mustered a bit of half-hearted rhetoric and re-heated climate funding, and suffered through the fallout of French president Emmanuel Macron accusing him of lying, but did nothing to dispel the view that Australia had no meaningful climate policies and was a roadblock at the talks not far removed from the Russians and Saudis. Things are more complicated now. Australia has competing climate stories, each with an element of truth. The positive version is that Labor under prime minister Anthony Albanese has made significant strides in the 18 months since it was elected, having introduced policies, landed two pieces of climate legislation, and proven itself a non-disruptive contributor on the global stage. That’s visible on the ground at the vast, sweaty former World Expo site on the outskirts of Dubai that is hosting Cop28. Australia’s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, chairs the umbrella group of countries, including the US, UK, Canada and Japan. The assistant climate minister, Jenny McAllister, was picked to co-lead a stream on how to deal with climate adaptation. Delivering a national statement to the conference on Saturday, Bowen argued Australia had made more progress on climate in the past 12 months than in nearly a decade under the rightwing Coalition. He listed successes: an underwriting policy to help reach a target of 82% renewable electricity by 2030; a limit on total pollution from the country’s biggest 215 industrial sites; offering residency to climate refugees from the tiny, low-lying Pacific island nation of Tuvalu; projections suggesting the 2030 emissions target – a 43% cut compared with 2005 – is within reach. While he was pleased with what his government had achieved, he said he was not satisfied. “We have all come so far, yet we find ourselves at the beginning, not the end,” Bowen said. On the question of whether Cop28 can reach agreement on the need to phase out fossil fuels – one of the major issues at the heart of the fortnight-long conference – the minister has offered a strong line. “We need to end the use of fossil fuels in our energy systems,” he said. The country is already moving away from coal in its electricity grid – cheap solar panels are making old and increasingly faulty fossil generators economically unviable – but it is so far doing little to reduce its production of coal and gas for global markets. This is Australia’s second story: it remains the world’s third biggest fossil fuel exporter, and allows energy companies to reap tens of billions of dollars each year selling coal and liquified natural gas (LNG), mainly to north Asia. Greenpeace has estimated 30 coal and gas developments that have been submitted to the government for approval could lead to more than 20bn tonnes of emissions across their lifetimes. It is highly unlikely all will go ahead but if they did to their full extent that’s roughly equivalent to 40% of annual global CO2. The biggest proposed development is a massive expansion of LNG exports from the Burrup Peninsula, in the country’s remote north-west. Led by the oil and gas giant Woodside, it includes two new gas fields and a near 50-year extension of the life of an existing processing facility so it can run until 2070. Labor has also maintained a A$1.5bn subsidy for a gas-focused industrial development in the Northern Territory. The Australian government’s position is that it cannot end the global fossil fuel trade alone because its customers would just get gas from somewhere else. It says the smart approach is to maintain the country’s long-standing trade relationships and work together on a clean transition. Critics say this argument – sometimes known as the drug dealer’s defence – would carry more weight if there was a clearer plan to help these countries kick their dirty habit. Some initial steps are being taken in this direction but Australian policymakers give wildly varying messages on the path ahead. The Labor premier of gas-rich Western Australia, Roger Cook, recently said his state should keep exploiting its gas reservoirs because otherwise people could run out of energy and die. There are also questions over how effective Labor’s domestic policies are at cutting pollution. A new analysis by the Climate Action Tracker released during Cop28 finds the improvement in the country’s future emissions trajectory is mostly due to an upward revision of how much CO2 will be absorbed by the country’s land and forests. This expected rise in natural sequestration means industrial greenhouse gases would only have to be cut by 24% between 2005 and 2030 for Australia to meet its 43% pledge. A boost in the amount of carbon stored in the land would obviously be welcome but scientists stress it is not necessarily permanent – particularly on a continent as bushfire and drought prone as Australia – and it will only be truly meaningful if it leads to a decrease in the total CO2 in the atmosphere. Otherwise it could just allow Australia’s industrial sectors to continue to pollute at a higher level, safe in the knowledge the country can claim it is meeting its emissions target. The Climate Action Tracker calls this “creating an illusion of progress, while the atmosphere suffers”. As Bowen says, this can’t be the end point. Next year the government has promised plans to cut emissions from sectors it has so far barely touched, including transport, industry, buildings and farming. But the argument over Australia’s responsibility to curtail its fossil fuel exports – which last month prompted more than 100 people to get themselves arrested blockading the world’s biggest coal port – is likely to only grow, and come further into focus as the country bids to host Cop31 in partnership with Pacific countries in 2026."
"An electric vehicle owner has used her car’s emergency power system to run her 11-year-old son’s life-saving dialysis machine and another has ridden to the rescue of his neighbours after devastating storms cut power in south-east Queensland. When the power went down after storms and flash flooding on Christmas Day, many residents immediately felt the consequences: electric gates did not work, septic tanks began to fill, air conditioners could not run and fridges began to warm as a heatwave followed. But some electric vehicle drivers whose cars are equipped with “vehicle to load” systems – a back-up power system that allows the car to act as an emergency generator or supply for devices such as lights, laptops, TVs and refrigerators – stepped in to help out and, in some cases, save lives. One woman on the Gold Coast, Kristy Holmes, 42, used her BYD electric car to power her 11-year-old son’s dialysis machine after their power shut off on Christmas Day. At first, Holmes and her husband used the car to plug in their fridges and those of their neighbours in the adjoining units but when the power did not come back on quickly, she started to wonder whether the BYD Atto 3 the couple bought in February could also handle the life-saving dialysis machine. “We ran it off the car,” Holmes said. “We only needed to use it for the one night. We could have run it for at least four nights and then have to go charge the car somewhere.” Her son Levi, who is about to go on a transplant list this month, would have faced life-threatening health consequences had he not been able to receive treatment, and would have needed to travel to Brisbane during the storm if he could not find an alternative. Holmes said she had known she could “use my car for good things” since she made slow-cooked mulled wine for a movie night using the car’s electric system. “It’s the most amazing car I’ve ever owned. Now it’s been able to save my son during a storm, I don’t think I’ll ever go back to a petrol car again.” Another EV driver, chemistry teacher Matt McLaughlin, 52, used his vehicle to help those in need after he posted to the Bonogin community Facebook group offering emergency power. “If anyone needs electricity briefly. To open gates, pump out biocycle etc. As long as it’s on a 3 pin 10A plug, I can help out,” he said. “My much maligned EV has V2L which means you can run power to it. Give me a shout but I will require you to publicly acknowledge that EVs aren’t all bad.” McLaughlin, a member of the Rural Fire Service, was unaffected by the power outage thanks to solar panels and a Tesla Powerwall home battery system at home. This allowed him to assist others, including a couple who had been locked in their home by an electric gate. “Most gates now have a key with which you can manually unlock them, but theirs was really old. There was nowhere to put the key,” he said. “They were trying to get out their back gate into the national park.” Other EV drivers with similar systems were out helping where they could, as were those with Tesla Power Walls who rigged up power to help run their neighbours’ fridges. “I think everyone does just help out around here,” McLaughlin said. “In a semi-rural area, you’ve got to help out your neighbours.” He said the crisis also taught a lesson to many about the advantages of zero-carbon technologies, included helping answer some “very anti-EV” sentiment from people who have sworn they’ll “never give up [their] dirty diesel”. McLaughlin said even his wife was initially sceptical about his heavy investment in solar panels, home batteries and their two electric cars, but has since been convinced. “We have been completely off-grid for six days, we’ve had air-con running and the pool pump running. I’ve been able to charge the car off the excess solar all day,” he said. “My wife thinks it’s fantastic. “People can be sceptical until they realise, ‘Hang on, this is going to be better’. If the power goes out for half an hour in the middle of the night, we don’t notice. We’re oblivious to it. “I wasn’t aware the power had even come back on when I woke up this morning.”"
"After promising early dumps of snow in some areas of Europe this autumn, the pattern of recent years resumed and rain and sleet took over. In the ski resorts of Morzine and Les Gets in the French Alps, the heavy rainfall meant that full opening of resorts was delayed until two days before Christmas, leaving the industry and the millions of tourists planning trips to stare at the sky in hope. But no amount of wishing and hoping will overcome what is an existential threat to skiing in the Alps, an industry worth $30bn (£23.8bn) that provides the most popular ski destination in the world. The science is clear, and is spelled out in carefully weighed-up peer reviewed reports. The most recent, this year, warned that at 2C of global heating above pre-industrial levels, 53% of the 28 European resorts examined would be at very high risk of a scarce amount of snow. Scarce snow has been defined as the poorest coverage seen on average every five years between 1961 and 1990. If the world were to hit 4C of heating, 98% of the resorts would be at very high risk of scarce snow cover. Another study has revealed the way in which snow cover in the Alps has had an “unprecedented” decline over the past 600 years, with the duration of the cover now shorter by 36 days. Some respond by holding on to the idea that skiing will and can survive if global temperatures are kept to the limits set by the Paris agreement, and if the industry adapts. But rumblings of discontent at the lack of action to ensure the survival of the sport by the International Ski Federation (FIS) broke into the open this year. The FIS was at the centre of a climate row in 2019 when Gian Franco Kasper, its president at the time, revealed himself as a climate denier in an interview, arguing that he would rather mingle with dictators than have to deal with environmentalists. He subsequently left and was replaced by Johan Eliasch. But that has not taken the heat off the federation. This year 500 professional winter sports athletes published a letter calling for greater climate action by FIS. They highlighted a competition schedule that forced skiers to take air flights backwards and forwards over the Atlantic from week to week, creating unnecessarily large carbon footprints, and called on the federation to open the season later and end it earlier to respect the changing climate. This was followed in October by a petition calling for the federation to do more to tackle climate change, which has attracted more than 35,000 signatures. The campaign wants the FIS to publish its own environmental impact with full transparency, move the race calendar by at least one month to respect the changing climate, reduce the requirement for air travel, and use its political influence to advocate for climate action at a governmental level. ﻿The FIS said that as a signatory to the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework (UNFCCC) it was committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. “We are working on a sustainability plan that will see us collecting as much data during the upcoming winter season as possible to provide the most accurate estimate of our CO2 footprint. “We have delayed the start of the season for one week and will continue to closely monitor whether we need to start the season even later.” Dom Winter, of Protect our Winters UK, which is behind the petition, said the science showed the death of skiing was not inevitable if global emissions were reduced and that was motivating climate action in the winter sports community. “The future of winter sport relies on how well we reduce emissions in the coming decades,” said Winter. He added: “Certainly at 2C the lower elevation resorts would be in big trouble. But there will still be places with natural snow in the Alps, so higher elevation resorts could survive. The concern is how expensive and elitist they might become.” Small amounts of snowmaking would help to keep some resorts going, he said, particularly those at lower altitude. But snowmaking at scale will never be able to supplant real snow as it is too expensive and uses too much energy and water. According to the most recent study, the use of snowmaking to achieve 50% snow coverage on pistes reduces the number of European resorts at high risk of loss of snow cover to 27% at 2C and 71% at 4C. Although the same study shows emissions from snowmaking are small, at just 2% of overall resort emissions, artificial snow use at scale creates problems in energy and water use. A study by the University of Basel found resorts located below 1,800 to 2,000 metres would have to abandon their lower slopes and increasingly rely on artificial snow to keep just their higher slopes open. The impact of artificial snow use for up to 100 consecutive days would raise water consumption by about 540m litres of water and pitch resorts against local communities because of competition over water use. In the French Alps water consumption could increase ninefold by 2100 from this reliance on artificial snow, according to the study. The federation said only by using carbon offsetting would it be possible to meet the 1.5c target of the Paris Agreement; and it had created the FIS Rainforest Initiative to do so. So while some are pushing for the industry to do more to adapt to keep the sport alive, others are working to embrace a new future rather than concentrating everything on the one sport. In Morzine, the non-profit sustainability Montagne Verte group is working at grassroots level to support a move to a low-carbon future in the area. Cécile Burton, general manager of Montagne Verte, said: “Temperatures in the Alps are rising at more than twice the global average and that is not good news for an industry dependent on snow. “Our approach is to focus on four-season tourism in the valley and to make the valley and mountains somewhere you can live all year. “There is life after skiing but we have to adapt and we have to imagine what our future will look like. This is an area where you can climb, mountain bike, walk, or just be in the environment and that is all year round. “We need to put more value in other times of the year not only from an environmental and sustainability perspective but from a human perspective because for somewhere to be a place you can live in all year round you have to have employment all year round.” As well as working to envision and support a new future, the collective works with local politicians and the industry to push for policies that reduce emissions. Most emissions from skiing come from the tourist flights to resorts, car travel in resorts, and energy used in the accommodation, so Montagne Verte is working on persuading politicians and businesses to move to car-free resorts. The group recently took eight local mayors to the car-free resort of Zermatt in Switzerland to examine whether Morzine could follow where that resort had led. The group has also succeeded in encouraging 100 businesses to become part of an Alpine express pass that offers discounts for snow passes, ski guides, spas massages and yoga to people who travel to their holiday by train. Al Judge, president of the luxury chalet holiday company AliKats is trying to adapt for the day when the snow stops. “We want to move the focus of our season from winter skiing,” said Judge. “Summer is our second biggest season, but we are trying to focus on getting a stronger demand for spring and autumn holidays so that when the snow does stop we have adapted to become a four-season, year round, business.”"
"British households will benefit from improved routes for recycling electronic goods from 2026, under government plans to have producers and retailers pay for household and in-store collections. Consumers would be able to have electrical waste (e-waste) – from cables to toasters and power tools – collected from their homes or drop items off during a weekly shop, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a consultation published on Thursday. The ambition is for retailers, rather than the taxpayer, to pick up the tab for these new ways of disposing of defunct, often toxic products safely. The measures are due to come into force in two years’ time. Almost half a billion small electrical items ended up in landfill last year, according to data from the not-for-profit Material Focus. This problem was particularly acute during Christmas, when 500 tonnes of Christmas lights were thrown away, the government said. The latest proposals build on efforts to grapple with the issue that the UK helped develop as a member of the EU. This included the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which came into effect in 2012. As with other waste-related rules they follow a principle that the producer of the waste will foot the bill for its disposal, which the UK and EU have followed in areas such as plastic packaging. The EU this year adopted policy recommendations for member states to improve collection of recycled materials, although targets vary by country. Post-Brexit, the UK has failed to keep pace with some EU regulatory efforts. The bloc is attempting to reduce e-waste with laws including a right to repair products, and requiring common chargers for phones (USB C) rather than Apple’s specialised lightning charger from 2024 onward. Cables, which are often hoarded as well as wrongly disposed of, are a major contributor to electronic waste. A lack of effective recycling capacity in areas such as battery processing has also left the UK lagging behind European peers on a range of recycling rates. An OECD study of British data shows it failed to meet its recycling targets for household e-waste from 2017 to 2020. The review by the economic thinktank found “further efforts are needed” for the UK to prevent illegal dumping and export of electronic waste including bringing in a proposed mandatory waste tracking system. The struggle to meet recycling targets comes despite Britain being one of the heaviest consumers of such items, according to a study by the consumer group U-Switch using data from the Global E-Waste Monitor report. The UK was second only to Norway for the amount of electrical waste it generates per person. Comparable data on electronic waste is patchy and needs improvement, MPs have warned. Measures aimed at easing the problem of electronic waste now include requiring larger retailers to create “collection drop points for electrical items in-store” for free, and without the need to exchange this with a new purchase. From 2026 onward, bricks-and-mortar retailers and online sellers would have to collect any broken or rejected large electrical goods including fridges or cookers when they are delivering a replacement product, Defra said. The recycling minister, Robbie Moore, said: “Every year millions of household electricals across the UK end up in the bin rather than being correctly recycled or reused. This is a sheer waste of our natural resources and has to stop.” He added: “We all have a drawer of old tech somewhere that we don’t know what to do with and our proposals will ensure these gadgets are easy to dispose of without the need for a trip to your local tip. Our plans will also drive the move to a more circular economy and create new jobs by making all recycling simpler.” Material Focus has created a tool to help consumers find recycling points for electronic items."
"Fruits that thrive in hot weather and can now be grown in the ever-hotter UK summers, and weeds such as cow parsley to decorate borders, are among the 2024 garden trends predicted by the Royal Horticultural Society. Climate breakdown has influenced most of the trends predicted by the horticulture charity, which seeks insights from its more than 600,000 members to forecast which plants may be in fashion in the coming year. While its trends list used to be based on simply which blooms were in vogue, now it highlights the quirks of gardening in a changing climate amid collapsing biodiversity. The predictions are based on horticultural trends and gardener inquiries to the RHS team of gardening advisers and pathology, entomology and botany experts. This year brought the highest number of inquiries the RHS has ever received – 115,000 questions. Recent hot, dry summers have influenced gardeners to try fruits that would ordinarily have failed in the mild UK weather. The RHS said recent years had been “ideal for certain fruits, grape vines being an outstanding example – but others include figs, almonds, apricots, melons, peaches/nectarines and watermelons”. They said, however, that one of the effects of climate breakdown was unpredictable and extreme weather, including harsher downpours of rain, and that the more usual UK-grown fruits including blackcurrants, apples and pears were struggling as they need sustained cold weather in winter to thrive. Garden designers at the RHS have also noted “the recent surge in patio fruit varieties, with dwarf raspberries, blackberries and mulberries”. Fruit and vegetable shortages last year caused by severe drought on the continent have inspired gardeners to grow their own. The RHS said: “After the temporary hiccup to the vegetable supply chain last spring, some gardeners now favour growing with more independence, including where they source their seeds. Localism is playing a stronger role, with some gardening gurus promoting the benefits of seed strains adapted to local climates.” Gardening for wildlife continues to be a big concern for UK RHS members. While in the past, gardening was sometimes a constant battle against so-called “pest” species, a more welcoming attitude has blossomed after people have become more aware of the biodiversity crisis. So much so, that the RHS has stopped calling slugs and snails “pests”. Inquiries to the RHS about wildlife gardening increased by more than 28% in 2023. Bug hotels and water features continue to be growing trends, as does using less water overall, after the 2022 drought. There is more awareness of the devastating effects of harvesting peat for gardening, with gardeners experimenting with peat-free gardening and home composting. Plants traditionally seen as weeds such as cow parsley, daisies and dandelions are being celebrated for the boost they give to native pollinators, and people have been creating pretty borders with these wildflowers. Purple plants and planet-friendly gardening: the full RHS trends list for 2024 Greening grey spaces Creative ways to green up grey urban spaces has become a major new trend as city gardeners are growing successfully in pots, growing up instead of out and using innovative ways of colonising indoor space, including terrariums. Grow your own The RHS gardening advice service and website continues to see growth in “grow your own”. The most popular plants are tomatoes, followed by cucumbers, courgettes, chillies and runner beans. Purple power Purple vegetables have traditionally been difficult for the home gardener but now breeders have begun introducing purple varieties that are easier to grow than traditional ones and avoid previous drawbacks, such as non-fruiting and limited purple colour, especially after cooking. Gardeners and chefs can anticipate purple carrots, cauliflowers, broccoli, tomatoes, peas, radish, French beans and lettuces. Climate change fruits Recent hot dry summers are ideal for certain fruits, grape vines being an outstanding example – but others include figs, almonds, apricots, melons, peaches/nectarines and watermelons. Local seed provenances and survivalist gardens After the temporary hiccup to the vegetable supply chain last spring, some gardeners now favour growing with more independence, including where they source their seeds. Going wild Plants traditionally seen as unwanted weeds such as herb robert and plantain are becoming popular. Cow parsley is now a desirable border plant and dandelions are recognised as being key to providing food for bees early in springtime. Gardening with nature The move away from classical, formal layouts towards naturalistic landscapes will continue to grow, with gardens making people feel that they are in a wild place and providing benefits to wellbeing, wildlife and ease of maintenance. Planet-friendly gardening Gardeners will be increasingly in tune with nature: inquiries to the RHS about wildlife gardening increased by more than 28% in 2023. Houseplants reach the next level – Tropical-looking plants and orchids which create a “jungle vibe” have become popular, as has growing up instead of out. Favourites will include epipremnum, sedum morganianum, and old favourites such as string of hearts and spider plants. Succulents Driven by houseplants and sourcing drought-resistant bedding, interest in succulents is increasing, with commercial landscapers introducing the hardier ones into landscapes. New cultivars are also being released, including aeonium, cotyledon and crassula."
"Parts of south-east Australia have been experiencing extreme heat over recent days. Temperatures hit 43.5C at Sydney airport on Saturday. This was the highest temperature recorded at this station since records began in 1929, and is about 15C above the December average. Authorities have issued several bushfire warnings and banned fires across many parts of New South Wales. Temperatures will ease early this week across south and south-east Australia, but will intensify across northern, western and central parts as the week progresses. Here, temperatures could rise widely into the 40Cs by the weekend. The record temperatures come as the Cop28 summit enters its final phase in the United Arab Emirates, and after the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service announced that 2023 was on course to be the hottest in recorded history. In fact, according to climate scientists, this year could be the warmest in more than 100,000 years, based on historical data collected from ice cores and tree rings. The announcement followed what was the hottest November ever recorded globally. The month also contained two days that were 2C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. The global average temperature in 2023 stands at 1.46C, close to the crucial 1.5C global warming threshold considered critical to avoid causing the most dangerous and irreversible impacts from climate change. The 2015 Paris agreement commits countries to limiting temperature rises to “well below” 2C. Finally, severe storms and tornadoes caused extensive damage and a number of fatalities across parts of the southern US state of Tennessee on Saturday. At least six people have been reported dead in Montgomery County and Nashville. The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings ahead of the storms. More than 80,000 people were left without power, with damage to homes in the city of Clarksville. Power lines, houses and many trees were also damaged in the town of Dresden. It is normally too cold and dry across this part of the US for severe storms during the month of December."
"The Kauaʻi ʻōʻō, a small black and yellow bird with glossy feathers and a haunting song, was the last surviving member of the Hawaiian honeyeaters. This year, it was officially declared extinct. The ōʻō was one of 21 species that the US Fish and Wildlife Service removed from the endangered species list in 2023 because they had vanished from the wild. Gone is the little Mariana fruit bat – also known as the Guam flying fox – and the bridled white-eye, which was once one of the most common birds on that island. So too, are the Scioto madtom, a diminutive, whiskered catfish that lived in Ohio, and the Bachman’s warbler, which summered in the US south and wintered in Cuba. Eight freshwater mussels in the south-east are officially extinct, as are eight Hawaiian birds. The delisting, which was finalised in November after two years of study and consideration, came as no surprise to biologists and conservationists. Many of these species had not been seen in decades. But the announcement was a sobering reminder that the climate crisis and habitat destruction are accelerating an extinction crisis that threatens 2 million species globally. For the scientists and environmentalists who have been working to protect these species, the delisting has been a moment to mourn – and to galvanise. “It’s a horrible tragedy,” said the ecologist and author Carl Safina. “And I think it is a breach of our moral guardrails.” Hawaii In the US, the loss of biodiversity is felt more acutely in Hawaii than anywhere else. Eight of the 21 delisted species were Hawaiian forest birds. Four other species are at imminent risk of extinction, largely due to an epidemic of avian malaria, a disease transmitted by invasive mosquitoes, and habitat loss. And the climate crisis, which has shifted local weather patterns and reshaped sensitive island ecosystems, is further complicating matters, said Rachel Kingsley. As an outreach associate with the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project, a conservation organization, she has been involved in efforts to recover the critically endangered cousins of the birds declared extinct this year. “Many of the same threats faced by the birds that were recently declared extinct are the same ones threatening our forest birds now,” Kingsley said. “Within the last handful of years, the threat of malaria has really increased dramatically.” To combat the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes that were probably introduced via European ships in the early 19th century, a coalition of federal and state officials and non-profit groups are releasing mosquitoes with a special strain of bacterium that can suppress the insects’ ability to reproduce. But in the meantime, warmer temperatures have expanded the mosquitoes’ range, pushing them into higher elevations, leaving forest birds with little refuge. “Unfortunately, it seems like the fast forward button kind of got pushed down on us,” said Kingsley. Global heating has also fueled extreme weather, exacerbated drought and wildfire risk, further imperilling the islands’ forest birds. This year, the devastating blaze that destroyed the town of Lahaina nearly engulfed a conservation centre for some of the world’s rarest birds, including the ‘akikiki, a species of honeycreeper that is considered the most endangered bird in the US. The fire came within about 150 feet of the property before conservationists were able to fight it off. For the scientists fighting to save them from extinction, bearing witness to their decline can be a profound and devastating responsibility. In his nearly 50-year career, Jim Jacobi, a biologist with the Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center, has been one of the last people on earth to ever see at least four birds that are now considered extinct. In 1984, he was one of the last people to ever hear the song of the Kauaʻi ʻōʻō. “I still get goosebumps – the hair in the back of my neck stands up when I think about it,” he said. He and two other researchers had hiked out to a remote forest in Kauai when they heard it. “That Oo’oo – oo-auh sound. “It was just amazing – very flute-like,” he recalled. He immediately turned on his recorder to capture the song. The bird flitted away – but a few moments later, when they hiked down to an old nest tree, they heard it again. Jacobi wanted to make sure his recorder was ready and working, so he rewound the tape and played it back. Suddenly, ʻōʻō came soaring toward the researchers, singing its mellifluous song. It came so close that they didn’t need binoculars to see its glossy black feathers, and the peek of yellow at its tail. “I thought, wow, this is fantastic!” Sincock said. Almost immediately, he deflated. The ʻōʻō had been drawn to a recording of its own voice – thinking it was another bird. “It came because it thought it heard something that it probably hadn’t heard for a long time – another of its kind,” he said. This bird was perhaps the last of his species, singing for a mate that would never come. Kauaʻi ʻōʻō was one of many ʻōʻō birds that lived throughout many parts of the Hawaiian islands. Its delisting marks the only complete loss of an entire avian family in modern times. Its cousins on the Big Island, Oahu and Molokaʻi had even grander tail feathers that were once used to construct the cloaks and capes worn by Hawaiian royalty, explained Jonee Peters, executive director of the Conservation Council for Hawaii. Hunters would collect the feathers without harming the birds, during the moulting season – using skills and knowledge that have all but faded away. “What makes us Hawai’ian is the collective experiences of ourselves and of our ancestors,” said Noah Gomes, a native bird expert and historian based in Hilo, Hawaii. “We’re losing something of ourselves when these birds disappear.” Mourning lost species The federal government first proposed removing nearly two dozen species from the endangered species list in 2021. Until then, only 11 other species had ever been delisted because of extinction in the 50 years since the ESA took effect. “The news just made me so sad,” said Tierra Curry, a conservation biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity. “I had all these feelings back then and I needed to process them.” So she organised a wake. She and a colleague wrote eulogies for each species, noting that the little Mariana fruit bat, “wasn’t all that little, actually”, and marvelling at how the inch-long San Marcos gambusia made a home for itself in a half-mile, slow-flowing section of the upper San Marcos River in Texas. During a virtual ceremony, as volunteers read out the tributes, she lit prayer candles embossed with each species’ image. “I thought about how I would grieve for a friend – and of course we would have a ceremony, and talk about them,” she said. She also thought about how she could honour their memory. “It’s important to make space for grief, because grief is a rational response to what is happening to the planet,” Curry said. “But it’s also important to not dwell there. As I lit the candles for each extinct species, I also focused on what I could do to save the ones that are still here.” When the Fish and Wildlife Services finalised its decision to declare the species extinct this year, Curry resolved to advocate for more conservation funding and a strengthening of the Endangered Species Act. This year has put renewed scrutiny on the landmark legislation and whether it is enough to fight the staggering rate of biodiversity loss. In many cases, Curry said, the species that were declared extinct this year had been listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) too late. The flat pigtoe mussel, for example, only gained ESA protections in 1987 – seven years after it was last seen in the wild, and more than a decade after construction began on a dam that experts agreed would imperil its population. In other cases, species are protected – but scientists lack the funding and resources needed to recover them. A 2016 study by CBD found that Congress only provides about 3.5% of the funding that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s own scientists estimate is needed to recover species. The Endangered Species Act has helped bring some species – such as the bald eagle – back from the brink. “But in some ways, the ESA is like having an emergency room and intensive care unit, without providing regular immunizations and check-ups,” said Safina. The scope of the extinction crisis, he said, “is completely overwhelming to the capacity of the human mind to actually know and understand”. Amid a worsening climate crisis and rapid deforestation and habitat loss, nearly all of nature needs urgent action and protection. It is nearly impossible for us to fathom how quickly, how many species are disappearing, Safina added. “And so the endeavour of stopping this crisis becomes more of a religious kind of experience than a scientific one, in a sense, more moral than practical.”"
"I’ll be 75 in March, and we old people often reflect on why certain things happened in our lives. This is very personal, but I was tall and skinny as a kid – I was always the one who was beaten up at school. The only refuge I had was in plants and bugs, and animals in general. Nothing in nature ever tried to “get me” – even predators. They weren’t after me. I always felt a sympathy with critters that were under attack or vulnerable. Your personality guides your research, and this got me interested in the idea of “harshness” in environments. This would eventually lead me to become a professor of biology at the University of Guelph, and to discover the most ancient and least-disturbed forests in eastern North America – perhaps even the oldest in North America. I didn’t begin by looking at trees. The organisms I first worked on were the most marginalised and misunderstood plants in the world: lichens. Many live in Arctic tundra where the wind, snow and cold attack vegetation all the time, making things tiny and stunted. And yet, they are surviving in their own little paradise because no one else bothers them. When I got my PhD, I decided to work in a habitat that would be as brutal as the Arctic tundra, and that’s when the idea to work on the Niagara Escarpment kicked in. There were these stunted, groggy-looking organisms up there and no one had ever considered them worth studying. People called them “rock scum”. But from the point of view of someone who is sympathetic to critters getting beaten up, this was a beautiful habitat; I wanted to study it. The people in my lab assumed Europeans had clear-cut all of southern Ontario, so we didn’t expect to find ancient trees anywhere. But then we found these tiny, ancient trees clinging on to a thin sliver of harsh habitat. When we found our first tree that was more than 1,000 years old I thought, “you have got to be kidding”. I had goosebumps. It was like a lightning bolt hitting – it put this forest into a completely different category. So many people had walked past this and just assumed there was nothing there. It’s within sight of the busiest highway in North America, the 401, and one of the largest cities, Toronto. It was a shock to find them in such an industrialised urban setting. We began research to find out the limits of antiquity of the trees in this forest. One was more than 1,800 years old, although it had died a long time ago. The next question was: is the presence of this ancient forest on these cliffs unique to Ontario? There are lots of beautiful limestone outcrops in the south of France so I contacted researchers in Montpellier and said we’d like to come and study them. Again, they told me there was “nothing there”. Yet they ended up finding one tree that had started to grow before the Romans left France. That made headlines in Le Figaro. This tree had watched the Romans leave! They are the oldest living plants in France. We found there were ancient forests on all the cliffs in the south of France, and then we ended up making similar discoveries in the US, New Zealand, Germany and England. It turned out these tiny ancient forests are everywhere. Cliffs have now been recognised as one of the hotspots of biodiversity globally. It was 1988 when the media first took an interest in the ancient forests. It’s now 2023, and it has never stopped. It links to the whole question of human life – when you work on something that’s 1,000 years old, suddenly you feel smaller and realise your role in the universe is not as grand as you’d thought. We humans place great value on productivity. What I’ve learned philosophically about life from the ancient trees is peace and joy can be found in the slow, the cautious and the careful, as much as it can be in the rich and famous. I have found the ancient forest to be my greatest teacher. The trees have taught me that growth is not necessarily essential or good. If we humans want to be sustained by this planet for ever, we cannot suck it dry. This ancient forest is one place that we haven’t got to – it has survived us by us ignoring it. There’s a way to make the planet infinitely sustainable for us, if we simply ask less of it. As told to Phoebe Weston Doug Larson is professor emeritus of biology at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. He is an expert on deforestation and regularly contributes to media discussions on the topic of old growth forests. His latest book, written with his son Nick, is called The Dogma Ate My Homework"
"Machines to magic carbon out of the air, artificial intelligence, indoor vertical farms to grow food for our escape to Mars, and even solar-powered “responsible” yachts: the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai has been festooned with the promise of technological fixes for worsening global heating and ecological breakdown. The UN climate talks have drawn a record number of delegates to a sprawling, freshly built metropolis, which has as its centrepiece an enormous dome that emits sounds and lights up in different colours at night. The two-week programme is laden with talks, events and demonstrations of the need for humanity to innovate its way out of the climate crisis. Given the ponderous action by governments to cut planet-heating emissions – the world is still hurtling towards disastrous climate breakdown – the tech focus is helpful, said Bill Gates, the multi-billionaire Microsoft co-founder, as he ventured into the Dubai sunshine. “I’m most optimistic about the incredible innovation,” he said. “People’s willingness to pay for climate is limited … We need to really innovate. You have to create the new before you shut down the old.” AI has been touted at Cop28 as a way to track emissions and has been used by young climate activists to send “compelling messages from the future” by artificially ageing them to represent themselves in the year 2050. An exhibition has featured people pitching climate innovations via hologram, while a company has promoted the idea of making aviation fuel out of the fruit of macaúba palm trees in Brazil. Some of the innovations feel particularly apt for the United Arab Emirates, a petrostate and coastal playground of the super-rich, such as an event to promote “responsible yachting”, held on Tuesday. The enormous emissions from yachts are “scary”, a spokesman for Sunreef Yachts, which positions itself as an eco-yacht company, conceded. But they added: “The yachting environment is very diverse. We are here to discuss the alternatives.” But this fixation has alarmed some scientists and climate activists, who warn that technologies are being used to distract from the primary task of stopping fossil fuels being burned. Cop28’s president, Sultan Al Jaber, also the head of the UAE’s national oil company, has questioned the feasibility of a fossil fuel phase-out. A record number of fossil fuel lobbyists are at this Cop, including Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, who has said he wants an “emphasis put on a problem statement of eliminating emissions, versus a problem statement focused on the oil and gas industry per se.” “It’s frightening because they see this as a new business opportunity, a new way to make money and continue as before,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate researcher at the University of Exeter, of the hopes being ladled upon carbon removal technologies. Total current technology-based CO2 removal, excluding nature-based means such as planting new forests, removes just 0.01m tonnes of CO2, according to recent research led by Friedlingstein, which is more than a million times smaller than current fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Despite its small scale, voluminous carbon removal techniques are relied upon in many climate models and plans by countries and companies to avoid breaching a 1.5C rise in global temperatures since pre-industrial times and unleashing catastrophic heatwaves, droughts, floods and other impacts. “They will scale this up, and if they do it by a factor of 100 in the next 10 to 20 years, that would be amazing, but they won’t scale up by a factor of 1 million,” said Friedlingstein. “There is no alternative to reducing emissions massively. These technologies are a distraction, a way to pretend we are dealing with the issue, but we aren’t. “We have housing insulation, we have electric vehicles, we have renewables, we have batteries. Scaling them up is not trivial, but we don’t need a magical new technology for the first 90% of this problem.” Greater efforts will be needed on “carbon management” – which includes directly removing carbon as well as capturing emissions at their source from industrial facilities and somehow storing them – if climate goals are to be met, negotiators from countries including the US, UK, Brazil and Kenya agreed at Cop28 on Wednesday. Keeping to 1.5C is “simply not possible” without the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS), said John Kerry, the US climate envoy, at the meeting. “This is not a US position, it’s a matter of science,” he said. “If we don’t have carbon capture, we can’t get to net zero.” Kerry acknowledged the yawning gap to the amount of emission reduction needed, but added: “We’ve got to try.” Capturing carbon is no substitute for cutting emissions and ramping up clean energy, agreed Majid Al Suwaidi, the UAE’s lead climate negotiator, but “the reality is, we need to deal with the energy systems we have while we build the energy systems we want”. Global emissions must be cut nearly in half this decade and then to net zero by 2050, and about 10% of this will probably have to come from carbon management techniques, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. Birol said that the sweeping expectations placed upon such technologies have largely fallen flat so far: “When I look at the last 15 years or so, the story of CCS is, to say the least, a disappointing one.” Countries are negotiating whether to include a phase-out of fossil fuels in the Cop28 agreement and a final deal may include language around “unabated” emissions. This would place fresh onus upon carbon removal and CCS – but also come at a cost. An extra 86bn tonnes of greenhouse gases could be released by 2050 if CCS is relied upon but underperforms, a new report by Climate Analytics has warned, while a major buildout and use of this technology will cost the world an extra $1tn a year, a separate study by Oxford University has found. But the lack of urgency in cutting emissions – 2023 is about to set new records in both heat and carbon pollution – means that no options should be discounted, according to Steve Smith, executive director of Oxford Net Zero. “You can’t take anything off the table if you want to meet our climate goals,” he said. “There’s not much scope for either/or. It’s both/and. This technology isn’t a false solution – there’s no one solution.” For countries in the teeth of the climate crisis, though, nothing but the end of the fossil fuel era will be enough. Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, which is at severe risk from rising sea levels and other hazards stemming from global heating, said she welcomed a commitment to ramp up renewable energy and other technologies, but said coal, oil and gas still needed to abandoned. “We can’t afford to not address the root cause of this problem,” she said. “We also cannot afford to pretend there are other pathways to retrieving 1.5C when so many lives are at stake.”"
"Wondering whether to pack a poncho or sunhat for carols? Locking in plans for a picnic or pool party on 25 December? Some media outlets are already offering a Christmas Day forecast – nearly three weeks out from the festivities – but is it too early to rely on the festive weather forecast? Christmas Day is weeks away, can we predict the weather yet? Any weather forecast more than 10 days ahead is basically “rubbish”, says Dr Martin Jucker, an atmospheric scientist and senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre. The Monash University meteorologist Dr Michael Barnes agrees. “A day ahead, we’re pretty sure. Seven days ahead we’re not so sure. Beyond seven to 10 days, we have no idea.” Barnes, who is based at the ARC Centre of Excellence for 21st Century Weather, says future weather conditions are sensitive to the current state of the atmosphere, so predictions become less accurate the further out in time you go. When can I start making weather-dependent plans? “Everyone’s hanging out for the Christmas forecast,” says Jonathan How, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. It’s still too early, he says, advising people to check in on 18 December. In the meantime, the BoM’s long-range forecast gives a sense of the overall conditions for December and summer. “What it’s showing is that most of Australia can expect a warmer and wetter December. It doesn’t mean that Christmas Day is more likely to be warm and wetter for everyone.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Where you live can also affect the reliability of the festive forecast, How says. In the west and north it’s pretty consistent; in the south and east things can change quite quickly. “We do know that summer in Perth is pretty consistently warm and sunny,” he says. “The same goes for Darwin, you can be pretty sure that you will get some chance of showers and storms at Christmas.” How do meteorologists actually make predictions about the weather? “It’s really funny how everybody relies on this, and very few people know how it works,” Jucker says. Weather forecasts rely on detailed observations of conditions – everything from clouds, wind, pressure, humidity, temperature and rainfall – collected by satellites, radar, weather balloons and at weather stations around the country. The bureau’s forecasts are based on “millions and millions” of real-time observations and data points, How says. That data feeds into weather prediction models, which estimate future conditions based on equations that govern the atmosphere. In Australia, expert meteorologists provide additional analysis based on their experience and local knowledge. Jucker says weather is “chaotic”, which means that tiny differences – in observations, or how the model computes – can grow and amplify the further out you go. “When you go too far into the future, those tiny little changes can become enormous, and they can easily become the difference between blue skies and deluge and any one given point.” What is the difference between weekly and seasonal forecasts? The BoM provides a seven-day forecast for cities and towns. How says this short-term outlook is “deterministic”, providing “a number of the temperature and a rainfall amount”. Whereas the long-term forecast is “probabilistic” based on the percentage chance of how conditions might differ from normal. But I checked the forecast, and the weather turned out differently? In some parts of the country – such as Adelaide or Melbourne – summer conditions can change quickly, How says. “You get 40 degrees at lunchtime, the cool change comes through at 4pm, and it drops back to 20 degrees.” Barnes says some types of weather – like thunderstorms – are inherently less predictable at a local scale. Thunderstorm activity might be forecast over an area, he says, “you might not know if it’s going to rain over your house or in the next suburb”. Ghosts of weather past – from heatwaves to white Christmas Just because it’s summer, doesn’t mean Christmas will be warm, How says. Last year Orange and Grenfell, in central west New South Wales, experienced a white Christmas of sorts after a giant hailstorm blanketed lawns and streets. And in 2006 Melbourne recorded its coldest Christmas, with snow in parts of Victoria. At the other extreme, Perth sweltered through a heatwave in 2021 reaching 43C on 25 December – it’s hottest Christmas Day on record. The day can throw up some surprises, How says. “Being in summer, that’s when we can see everything from cyclones to heatwaves to large storms. Anything is possible.” It’s a reminder that the Australian summer and Christmastime can be high risk or the peak of the severe weather season, he says. “That’s why we always do tell people to keep across the forecast and warnings, especially in summer … conditions can change and become more dangerous very quickly.”"
"Pigeons of the patient mind swirl over roofs of the post office and a Wetherspoon’s named after Wilfred Owen, the Oswestry-born poet. All the birds have been shaken by this recent brood of storms, which deepen the answering violence of the oceans. Through the physics of vulnerability, all the molecules of bird and wind rush in the same direction, casting hollow bones through the forward motion of primary feathers into the aerodynamics of trust. The trees are shaken too. An old beech, with all its grand architecture and generations of carved graffiti like runic script, was downed in Cae Glas Park. Out in the fields up Penylan Lane, jackdaws settle in an oak. In its dark hollow is an imprisoned King Lear, who raged against the storm, daring it to “crack its cheeks” and send the “oak-cleaving thunderbolt”. It’s quiet now. Rain returns, clouds wrap the skyline, and the crazy old oaks, instead of raging in their own heads, have withdrawn into themselves. “No,” Lear says, “I will be the pattern of all patience. I will say nothing.” These days around the winter solstice are not saying much. A leaf across the water of a ditch that chunters into a culvert under the lane is floating towards an elegant strangeness. The waters, like the winds, travel to some fixed tension between the swirling of birds and the longing of trees, the solstice moment that is both light and dark, air and water, above ground and below. This darkest day and its lightening is a leaf carried through subterranean ways: leaking into cellars, flushing down drains and flooding springs. The one that surfaces in St Oswald’s Well is breaking out of jail. Its trickle, escaping under iron bars, seeps through storm debris then vanishes. It searches for a different future from the myth of how the spring was created when Oswald’s arm – dismembered after the battle with King Penda, the last pagan king – was dropped by a “great bird”. Such stories wind through centuries of solstices, the twists of unspoken moments between chaos that belong to liverworts in the well, fungal rot in trees, trackless movements of birds in the air, Lear’s pattern of all patience. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount"
"This story was produced by Grist and co-published with the Guardian. For years, Josana Pinto da Costa ventured out every morning on to the waterways lining Óbidos, Brazil, in a small fishing boat. Gliding over the murky, churning currents of the Amazon River basin, her flat nets brought in writhing hauls. Scorching temperatures have now made that routine unsafe. The heat has “been really intense” this year, said Pinto da Costa, forcing her to shift her working hours to the dead of night. She now sets off in the pitch dark to chase what fish are also awake before dawn. It’s taken a toll on her catch, and her wellbeing. But it’s the only way she can continue her work in the face of increasingly dangerous temperatures. Many of the communities that catch, grow and harvest the world’s food supply are beginning to work when it’s still dark out, or even shifting to a fully overnight schedule as a way to cope with rising temperatures. “The obvious piece of advice that you’ll see given is, ‘Work at night. Give workers head torches,’ and so on,” said Zia Mehrabi, a food security and climate researcher at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “But the reality is, that can lead to other rights violations, other negative impacts.” Óbidos, Brazil: ‘More hours with less food’ For Pinto da Costa and other Brazilian fishers, night-time work has brought additional hardship to a community already struggling with the impacts of climate change. The region has experienced decades of severe drought causing fish to die off and physically isolating people as waterways dried up. Research shows that regularly working during the night is physically and mentally disruptive and can lead to long-term health complications. Night-time fishing threatens social and communal routines: A daytime sleep schedule can curb time spent with loved ones, as well as limit when wares can be sold or traded in local markets. It’s also affecting their ability to support themselves and their families through a generations-old trade. “We’ve actually been working more hours with less food, with less production,” said Pinto da Costa, who advocates nationally for fishing communities through the Movement of Artisanal Fishermen and Fisherwomen of Brazil. Outdoor workers, with their typical midday hours and limited access to shade, face some of the greatest health risks during periods of extreme heat. A forthcoming analysis – previewed exclusively by Grist – found that, on average, the amount of time considered unsafe to work outside during a typical 9-to-5 workday will increase 8% by 2050, assuming greenhouse gas emissions stay on their current trajectory. Currently, an estimated 21% of the global population already faces dangerous levels of heat stress during typical workday hours for more than a third of the year. By 2050, without cuts to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, that portion will jump to 39%, according to the analysis by Naia Ormaza Zulueta, a University of Colorado, Boulder PhDstudent, and Mehrabi. “The number of days that people will experience a violation of their rights to a safe climate is going to substantially increase, but then also the number of possible working hours in a season, and productivity, is going to be substantially reduced,” said Mehrabi. “It’s a massive lose-lose situation.” The analysis finds that outdoor agricultural workers will encounter the greatest health-related risks. Workers in India, where there are roughly 260 million agricultural laborers, are projected to be among the most vulnerable. By 2050, 94% of the country’s population could face more than 100 days in a year when at least one hour exceeds a wet-bulb temperature of 82.4F – a conservative threshold of what is considered safe for “moderate” work. (Unacclimatized workers face higher risks.) In Brazil, another top agricultural producer, outdoor workers also face substantial risk. By 2050, roughly 41% of the country’s population could experience more than 100 days a year of wet-bulb temperatures exceeding the recommended threshold for at least one hour a day, according to the Boulder analysis. In the United States they project that figure at 35% of the population. Mary Jo Dudley, the director of Cornell University’s Farmworker Program and the chair of the US National Advisory Council of Migrant Health, said that the analysis was significant for what it reveals about how extreme heat affects the health of the world’s agricultural laborers. She’s seeing more outdoor agricultural workers in the US adopt overnight schedules, adding to the burdens and inequities they already face. “This transition to a night-time schedule pushes an extremely vulnerable population into more difficult work conditions that have significant mental and physical health impacts,” said Dudley. Rebuking the human body’s circadian rhythms – that 24-hour internal clock that regulates when you sleep and wake – ramps up a person’s risk of health complications, such as cardiovascular disease and types of cancer, and diminishes the body’s ability to handle injury and stress. Working non-traditional hours also can reduce a person’s ability to socialize or participate in cultural, communal activities, which are associated with positive impacts on brain and body health. Women are particularly vulnerable to the social and economic impacts of transitioning to night-time schedules. Despite making up nearly 45% of artisanal fishers in Brazil, women earn less than their male counterparts. When harvests decline with night-time fishing, their margins are even smaller. Night-time hours also clash with gendered family roles, such as caregiving, said Mehrabi. “When you talk about changing working hours, you talk about disrupting families.” Shifting working hours to the night-time “is not a universally applicable solution”, said Zulueta, the Boulder study author. “When I saw that … people were giving this advice of changing their working shifts to the night, I was shocked,” she said, citing a paper published earlier this year. Ahmedabad, India: ‘If we lose our livestock, we lose our culture’ Growing up in Ahmedabad, India, Bhavana Rabari has spent much of her life tending to her family’s buffalo. She is now an advocate for pastoralists but the routine is still ingrained in her: wake up, feed and milk the herd, and then tend to the fields. But extreme heat threatens that schedule. When temperatures soar past 90F in Ahmedabad – now a regular occurrence – Rabari worries about her mom, who hand-collects feed for their herd. “If we lose our livestock, we lose our culture, our dignity,” said Rabari. Rabari said she didn’t see tending to the herd in the dark as safe or accessible for her family or others in her community, some who walk at least 10 miles a day. “We are not working at night,” she said. But her family does rise at 5am to beat the heat, collecting milk from their buffalo and preparing products to sell in the market. Hotter temperatures have already caused pastureland to wither, meaning animals are grazing less and producing less milk. Fewer safe working hours means, on top of that, even less income. The result has been an exodus from the trade. Rabari said that many younger pastoralists she knows are now seeking employment as drivers or cleaners in urban Ahmedabad. Rabari, an organizer with the Pastoral Women Alliance, said women are most often the ones left behind to tend to the herds. They “have to take care of their children, they have to take care of the food, and they have to take care of the water”, she said. “They face the heat, they face the floods, or the excess rain.” Iowa, United States: ‘It would be far more dangerous’ Halfway across the world, April Hemmes is facing unrelenting heat in Hampton, Iowa. A fourth-generation soya bean and corn farmer, Hemmes works more than 900 acres on her own. Human-caused climate change has battered the midwest, one of the world’s leading agricultural producers. Scientists only recently declared an end to a drought that had devastated the region for 203 weeks. The conditions affected crop yields, livestock, the transportation of goods and the larger supply chain. This past summer, the heat index in Iowa repeatedly soared past 100F. To avoid dangerous heat exposure, Hemmes took frequent breaks and made sure to finish the bulk of the day’s work in the morning. She began her day in the fields an hour or so earlier. “This [farm] has been in my family for over 125 years,” said Hemmes, who took over operations after her grandfather and father both retired in 1993. “I do everything from banking to planting to spraying, everything. So it’s all on me, and it’s my family farm.” But for Hemmes, night-time work is out of the question. Not only are summertime mosquitoes in Iowa “terrible after dark”, and she’d need to install lights throughout the fields, but Hemmes says some of the chemicals she uses have restrictions on when she can spray them. “It would take more energy to work at night,” said Hemmes. “I think it would be far more dangerous.” As a member of the United Soybean Board, Hemmes advocates for women in agriculture and on ensuring solo operations like hers can access the technology they need to overcome heat spells. On her own farm, she credits an autonomous tractor as one of the reasons she’s able to manage hundreds of acres on her own. For workers around the world, it’s a race against time. Eventually, even working at night may not be enough to keep outdoor agricultural work viable. The Boulder researchers found that working overnight will not significantly reduce heat exposure in key agricultural regions – particularly across India. After all, heatwaves also occur at night, and overnight temperatures can rise even more rapidly than daytime highs. “How do you solve a problem like that?” said Mehrabi. “The reality is that the workers most at risk are the people contributing least to the climate change problem.”"
"Give people the right to walk around the edges of privately owned fields, say campaigners seeking to open up more paths in the countryside in England and Wales. Slow Ways, a group advocating for more access to the countryside, said people in rural areas often have to walk on roads that do not have pavements, which can be extremely dangerous. The British public appears to agree. A poll by YouGov found seven out of 10 adults (71%) thought people should be allowed to walk along the edge of fields that were privately owned, as long as they were respectful and responsible, and if the only other option was to walk down a narrow or busy road with no pavement or legal footpath. Two-fifths of respondents said they were likely to walk more if such a walking network existed. In England, only 8% of the countryside is designated as open access for walking, picnicking and other outdoor activities. This includes mountains, moors, heaths and downs. In Scotland, all of the countryside is open for access as long as guidelines are followed such as leaving no trace and not harming farmland. There has been a recent groundswell of public campaigns involving mass trespasses, which have sometimes attracted thousands of people, asking for a general right to walk across the English countryside. “Going for a walk in the countryside can mean risking narrow lanes, blind bends and fast vehicles,” said Dan Raven-Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Slow Ways. “According to the Department for Transport, two pedestrians die and 34 are seriously injured by vehicles on rural roads each week. The government can save thousands of lives and bring millions of people so much joy by ensuring there is always a safe way to walk.” Slow Ways is calling on the government to develop an inclusive, extensive and easy-to-follow national walking network, including this proposal. Raven-Ellison said: “While hikers would benefit from improved access, the people who would benefit most of all would be the 10 million people who live in the countryside and feel these issues day in, day out. Many people who live in rural areas are surrounded by fields, but effectively live on islands that they can only venture in or out of by car.” The Labour government has now announced it will repeal a 2031 cut-off date for recording historical rights of way, which was set by the Conservatives. England has thousands of miles of unrecorded rights of way, estimated to stretch more than 40,000 miles, which are well used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians but are not officially recorded or protected. The previous Conservative government had announced that all of them needed to be formally recorded by 2031, but local authorities had been struggling to meet the deadline. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced on Thursday it would remove the registration deadline. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Our countryside is a source of great national pride, and this government wants to improve access to nature for people. “We are committed to making sure the public access nature, from green spaces to forests to river walks, in a responsible way and we strongly encourage everyone to follow the countryside code.”"
"The UK is at risk of a drastic slowdown in its transition to electric cars because of big disparities in the availability and cost of charging points, especially in poorer areas, a report says. The study, by the consultancy Stonehaven, argues that given rapid advances in batteries and car range, persuading more people to move to electric vehicles is now less an issue of technology than one of “urban management and social equity”. It cites London, which has the UK’s highest usage of electric cars, as an example of what the report’s authors call a lack of coherent strategy over on-street charging points, which are left to individual councils to install. This has led to huge variations in provision, with one London borough, Harrow, having 63 charging points, compared with nearly 2,700 in another, Westminster. The report says the evidence points towards such infrastructure being disproportionately available to people in richer areas, and less so to those who would be more likely to benefit from being able to use an electric vehicle. The study, taking another example from London, says the two outer boroughs of Bexley and Havering have a combined 14,000 people who work in the transport and storage industries, and there are just 260 public chargers between them. By contrast, in the more central borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, 3,000 people have such jobs and there are more than 2,600 chargers. It notes, however, that public charging is only part of the challenge, given how much more expensive this tends to be than charging an electric car at home – between six and 10 times more costly, the report calculates. It is illegal to run a cable along a pavement, meaning the only people who can use domestic charging are those with driveways or other off-street parking. Even if people do flout the law and use a cable from their home, this depends on them being able to park directly outside. Those able to charge a car from their domestic power can use specific electric car night-time tariffs, which can be as low as 7p/kWh. In contrast, public chargers cost 50p-75p/kWh, a higher cost-per-mile than petrol, the report says. Adding to the disparity is the 20% VAT charged for this, while home charging has a 5% rate. “High-income owner-occupiers working in geographically stable jobs can get to the benefits of electric vehicles more easily, whilst people living in inner-city areas, earning lower wages or without access to a driveway are all at a disadvantage,” the authors note. “This creates challenges both for the speed of electric take-up, and wider social fairness.” The report says the impact of this is already being felt. The governmental programme of subsidies for electric vehicles has encouraged a large take-up, with the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) raising its forecasts for usage three times between 2019 and 2021. However, the study says this “generation one” rollout is slowing. With a lack of available and affordable charging for wider use, sales have lagged behind expectations. The report says that while it is too early to offer specific policy recommendations, the government needs to focus urgently on how to provide easily available and affordable charging points. “While generation one of EV policy proved electric vehicles could work, it made no systematic effort to deal with the situations where take-up was harder,” it says. “The challenge for policymakers has changed. It is no longer a matter of making the first electric cars succeed. Instead it is about making the average car electric, in a way that is simple and persuasive to average households.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government was making good progress with public charging points, with the UK-wide total having increased by 40% over the past year to more than 72,000. They added: “We’re also providing over £2.3bn to support industry and drivers make the switch, and our measures are working, with electric vehicles making up one in four of all cars sold this November.”"
"As a fossil fuels and climate reporter, most of my journalism focuses on the need to radically overhaul the energy system. But the food sector also needs a makeover, as it creates between a quarter and a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. When scientists came up with a new climate-friendly food plan in 2019 and published their findings in the medical journal the Lancet, I read with interest. The guidelines called for more vegetables, legumes and whole grains, which seemed doable to me. The authors even allowed for meat and dairy consumption, albeit in small quantities. Both are major drivers of the climate crisis: the United Nations estimates that meat and dairy produce more than 11% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, and some experts put the figure at up to 19.6%. But I’ve long wondered whether the widely respected food plan could work for most Americans. In my hometown of Baltimore, a quarter of all people live in food deserts, a figure some researchers say is an underestimate. Nationally, grocery stores have shuttered left and right in recent years. Increasingly, many Americans are relying on a very particular kind of shop for food: dollar stores, which are the fastest-growing retailers in the US. In Baltimore, there are dozens. Those factors dictate how sustainable – and nourishing – individual diets can be. “Our food choices are largely shaped by the food environment around us, including which foods are available, affordable, convenient and desirable,” said Raychel Santo, a Baltimore-based senior food and climate research associate at the non-profit World Resources Institute. “Everyone deserves the opportunity to enjoy healthy, sustainable meals that nourish both people and the planet.” Can dollar stores provide Americans with that opportunity? I decided to find out. For one week, I attempted to follow the Lancet planetary health diet while grocery shopping at them exclusively. The experience left me feeling dejected – and bloated. The dollar store Other people have created extensive spreadsheets and meal plans for their forays into the planetary health diet. I’ve never been a planner. To guide my grocery shopping, I merely typed the basic tenets of the food plan into my phone’s notes app: 34% of daily calories from starches like rice and wheat; 23% from legumes; 18% from fats; 8% from fruits and vegetables; the remaining 10% from dairy, meat and sugar. I planned to head to the store after my first meeting, but got busy until mid-afternoon. When I reached Dollar Tree, I quickly filled a cart with beans, tortillas, pre-cooked brown rice, oatmeal, peanut butter and other staples. I was in desperate need of vegetables but the options were highly limited. I sighed as I placed some canned ones in my cart. In the checkout aisle, I saw a can of Pringles chips. Having skipped breakfast, I was starving, so I impulsively added them to my haul and ate them on the drive home. Hours later, I realized I’d made a mistake. The diet encourages limiting consumption of both starchy vegetables and saturated oils, which are both surprisingly emissions-intensive to produce, and I’d gone over my daily allotment of the latter. I resolved to be more careful. For a proper lunch, I heated some brown rice and whipped up black beans from a can, which were more expensive than the ones I buy from my usual grocery store. As luck would have it, my can opener broke, so I was forced to hack open a can of corn with a knife. I ate my austere lunch with little pleasure. For dinner, I had leftovers with half a slice of tinny-tasting cheese. I desperately wanted to add some fresh produce to my meal, but the Dollar General had none. When I sat down to analyze my day’s meals, I realized I was way behind on my fruit and vegetable intake, since the Lancet authors classify corn as a starch. I quickly stir-fried some tinned green beans with salt and pepper. They were awful. Breaking the rules I woke up the next morning and realized something would have to change. I’d prepared my first day’s food with only ingredients from Dollar General, but since the Lancet study doesn’t address spices, I decided using seasonings from my cabinet would be OK. This helped, but new problems arose. I’d planned to eat liberal scoops of peanut butter each morning since the diet calls for a high intake of legumes, but the brand I’d purchased had added sugar, which is discouraged in the climate diet (since it’s surprisingly land-, water- and carbon-intensive to produce and linked to health issues like diabetes), so I had to instead rely on salted peanuts. The tortillas I’d purchased also had a surprising amount of added sugar, as did the mandarin orange fruit cups and tins of pineapple I’d bought in a desperate attempt to integrate fruit into my diet. For the next couple of days, I stuck to brown rice and corn to meet my starch intake, and rinsed the fruit off thoroughly before eating it. Experts say eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables is beneficial for gut health, but I quickly realized that wouldn’t be an option, since the Dollar Store doesn’t offer much variety when it comes to plants. In search of produce When I began my experiment, I resolved not to eat out for the week. I figured it would betray the spirit of the project to go to restaurants, as much as it pained me to refuse a friend’s invitation to grab pizza. But on night three, I caved. At a work event, I munched on a handful of cherry tomatoes and carrot sticks – climate diet-friendly foods, sure, but ones that surely didn’t come from a dollar store. Those bites of crudités left me fiending for more fresh food. Dollar General has since last year been adding produce to more of their stores, so the following morning, I called around to find one. Soon, I found a location that offered fruits and vegetables a 15-minute drive away. I was excited by the prospect of a salad, but I felt ridiculous. That week, I’d already driven to my closest Dollar Tree and now I was going to have to drive even more. Using an online carbon calculator, I learned that my round-trip drive could generate up to 5lb of planet-warming carbon dioxide, meaning it could be more emissions-heavy than a three-ounce steak. I started to spiral. I’m no believer in emphasizing the personal carbon footprint, and yet I’d taken on this project! But I pushed these thoughts aside as I drove. Slim pickings The Dollar Tree produce pickings were slim: browning bananas, bags of potatoes and onions, and some uninspiring pre-made salads. The cherry tomatoes were starting to mold; the mushrooms were covered in soft, dark spots. The iceberg lettuce looked OK, but the more nutritious romaine was wilting – and twice as expensive. The plastic-wrapped bell peppers were in the best shape, so I felt I had to grab some even though they’re my least favorite vegetable. I reluctantly placed a sad-looking selection of produce into my cart, then went in search of other groceries. This time, I was equipped with a more extensive list. But many of my desired items were nowhere to be found. There were no lentils, no whole grains other than rice, and no loaves of bread tortillas, or yogurt that didn’t have added sugar. I had also hoped to find some climate diet-friendly frozen meals, but save for the bags of fries, every single option contained meat, cheese or both. I went home and cooked some black beans for the second time that week, adding peppers, tomatoes and a whole onion. I ate my stew over brown rice with a whole head of romaine lettuce. It would have to do. Off the rails The following day, I had oatmeal with bananas and strawberries for breakfast and more rice, beans and salad for lunch. But that evening, things went off the rails. It was the weekend and I had family in town, so I decided to break the rules to show them my favorite local oyster bar. When we placed our order, I thought all bets were off for my meal plan. But as it turned out, I didn’t fare so badly. The oysters were allowed, and even the half a burger I had fell within my red meat allotment. I ate some much-needed brussels sprouts, beets and nuts. And since the diet didn’t mention drinks, I suppose even my martini – fine, two martinis – was alright. But nothing I ate that night could have come from the Dollar Store. In fact, my dinner cost more than all my other meals that week combined. While eating some dollar-store popcorn later that night – a whole grain, so diet-friendly – I perused the menus of the cheaper local restaurants I frequent. They invariably offered meat, cheese and sugar-heavy fare. In the final days of my experiment, I tried to use up all of my Dollar Store purchases, but some of my produce spoiled quickly. I’d unintentionally contributed to an issue the Lancet authors highlighted: food waste is a major contributor to climate-warming emissions, and the authors say it should be cut by half. On my final food plan day, I noticed a purple head of local radicchio in my crisper drawer, which I’d bought at the health food store the previous week. I was fresh out of Dollar Store vegetables and didn’t want it to spoil, plus I was sick of beans and rice, so I cheated and ate the whole thing with lemon juice and olive oil. Targeted policy to expand food access, experts have pointed out, will be necessary for the Lancet climate food plan to become effective. Amid research showing that many people lack access to nutritious meals, advocates are pushing for Dollar Stores to stock fresher, more desirable healthy foods. That could help improve people’s overall well-being, and it could also improve the health of the planet. But dollar stores alone aren’t the problem, so they can’t be the only locus of the solution. The broader food system must change to ensure people can eat sustainably. “Increasing access to a variety of plant-based foods [and] the presence of these options at stores and other food providers is the first step,” said Santo. “Other factors including the cost, quality, convenience of preparation, variety and cultural relevance are also key to shaping a food environment that enables healthy and sustainable food choices.” In the meantime, I’ll no longer take my ability to access and afford a variety of food for granted. That goes for fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains – but now that I’m off the climate diet, I might also eat another can of Pringles.

"Late November’s weather provided a barnstorming performance. Temperatures plunged but were then wrenched into a steep climb. Gales flipped everything over before the nosedive into frost began again. Into December and a morning of half-hearted drizzle and still but warmer air seemed exceptional. Low cloud settled on the purplish crowns of birches; the bronze moor muted with dampness. A sudden crackling exchange between two jays simply emphasised how quiet it was. “A vacant sameness grays the sky,” as Thomas Hardy put it. Nothing to see here. Except, of course, there was. In the blunted light, something complicated and yellowy orange was reaching out from the tangled grass at my feet. This was meadow coral, its Latin name, corniculata, catching nicely the antler-like structures of this exquisite fungus. Although not rare, the unimproved grassland it thrives on is rare these days. This piece of rough pasture is nibbled enough for the coral to show off its complex potential. In longer grass, its branches tend to stretch and become simpler. Here, it could luxuriate in all its strangeness, like one of Mondrian’s chrysanthemums, except with horns, like those of the red deer that often browse in the neighbouring woodland. Meadow coral is saprotrophic, meaning its delicate filaments below ground digest the nutrients in decaying organic matter, chemically breaking into cells in an elegant smash and grab. The sum of these filaments, or hyphae, makes up its mycelium, spreading out beneath my feet underground, threading its way through the soil, tangling itself in the ebb and flow of life. The swarm of intertwined orange tendrils two inches above ground are simply the fruiting body of a much more extensive organism. The colour is a clue that this fungus’s appearance above ground will shortly end. They fruit between June and November, at first pale yellow in colour and darkening as time passes. Convention says their odour is unremarkable, but when I bring my nose against it, I sense a strong, chemical smell, almost like aniseed. Drama over, I get back to my feet and take this new mystery home. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at guardianbookshop.com and get a 15% discount"
"The first river to be given bathing water status in England is in limbo waiting for the Environment Agency (EA) to approve crucial nature-based solutions that are part of £43m in improvements to cut sewage pollution. In the West Yorkshire town of Ilkley, campaigners were the first to use the EU-derived bathing water regulations to drive a cleanup of their river. But since part of the River Wharfe was granted bathing water status in 2020, water quality has persistently been recorded as poor, most recently in the latest classifications last month. If it remains poor next year, when the status is up for renewal, it could lose its bathing water designation. The race to clean up the river comes as water companies await Thursday’s decision from the regulator, Ofwat, on how much they can raise customer bills to the end of the decade. This will pay for investment of between £88bn and £100bn to tackle sewage pollution, replace creaking infrastructure and fix leaks. Customers face huge bill rises in some areas, with Southern Water seeking rises of 84% and Thames Water 53%. Water companies are simultaneously seeking to increase dividend payments to attract investment that will be repaid by customers via their bills. Yorkshire Water wants to be allowed to increase annual average bills to £569 by 2030. In Ilkley, the £43m of improvements to the treatment plant, including expanding storage capacity and the creation of nature-based filtering systems to clean up the river, have been agreed by Yorkshire Water and Ofwat. But the EA has yet to grant a permit for a 4,000 sq meter aerated rush bed that will provide a natural solution for the secondary treatment of sewage storm overflows before they enter the river. Becky Malby of the campaign group Ilkley Clean River said: “These are known solutions. The Environment Agency should know how to permit and support nature-based solutions as part of the treatment of all our sewage. It is better for the environment and it is cheaper. “We are now waiting for the EA to work out how to permit a nature-based solution, when they have been around for years.” The Wharfe reflects the poor water quality of rivers across England, where no river meets good quality testing thresholds owing to excessive levels of biological and chemical pollution. Malby said the inability of the water companies and regulators to recognise the pollution sources, and to put plans in place quickly despite years of public outrage, was disgraceful. On Thursday Ofwat will publish its decision on whether it will allow customer bill rises of, on average, 40%, as well as allowing firms to increase dividend payments amid criticism that customers are again funding companies that are failing. Over the past three decades since privatisation, English water companies have paid out £53.1bn in dividends – £83bn in today’s prices – and built debts of £60.3bn. Thames Water, the biggest of the privatised firms, is struggling with debts of £15bn and attempting to shore up its finances. Last week the company revealed sewage pollution had soared by 40% in the six months to 30 September as its debts continued to rise. In October, water companies were given penalties of £157.6m after they missed pollution and leak targets. Thames Water accounted for more than a third of the penalties, at £56.8m. All water companies are under investigation by Ofwat and the EA for illegally dumping sewage. Malby said: “But despite all this we are likely to hear this week that bills will go up by an average of 40%; ranging from 25% Anglian to 84% at Southern Water. “Not only have we already paid, but these bill rises are not matched by a clear deadline for cleaning up our rivers, lakes and seas from sewage pollution.” Malby and other campaigners, including Save Windermere, Windrush against Sewage Pollution and SOS Whitstable, have been critical in exposing the routine use of raw sewage discharges into rivers by water companies. They want a radical overhaul of the way the industry is managed, calling for Thames Water and other failing companies to be placed into special administration to allow the government to introduce much-needed reforms. A Yorkshire Water spokesperson said: “We are investing significantly in the River Wharfe at Ilkley – the first inland bathing water in the region – including improvements to storm overflows, a new £15m sewer, additional treatment at upstream wastewater treatment works and £60m early investment at the existing wastewater treatment works to upgrade it, including a nature-based solution, which is subject to Environment Agency approval.” An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We take our responsibility to protect the environment very seriously. We have approved a trial for the use of Nature Based Solutions in Yorkshire, including a reed bed for the treatment of storm overflows, which is subject to certain conditions, monitoring and reporting. It is for Yorkshire Water to decide whether the trial will go ahead and following this the Environment Agency would then work with the company on permitting.”"
"Nordic countries are often associated with cold, snowy winters and temperatures well below zero celsius. However, this year unseasonably mild weather is forecast to move in across Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland over the Christmas period, with temperatures well above the seasonal average. A particularly mild air mass is expected to arrive on Christmas Day, with temperatures widely rising above 0C (32F). Oslo, Stockholm and Helsinki will probably have highs of 5-6C on Christmas Day, with a high of about 10C in Copenhagen. These temperatures would be 4-5C above the seasonal average, but the highest anomalies will be found further north across Finland, where temperatures in Rovaniemi – the capital of Lapland – will be up to 8C above average with an expected high of 2C on 25 December. Night-time temperatures are also expected to be well above average, generally remaining above freezing. However, even where temperatures do drop below freezing, such as in Rovaniemi, they will only fall to about -2C, which is more than 9C above the average minimum for late December. The mild conditions look set to continue for the rest of the year, before trending back down to around average as the new year starts. On the other side of the world, the Perth region in Western Australia experienced its hottest day so far of this season, with a second summer heatwave hitting over the weekend and continuing into this week. Temperatures soared into the 40s celsius on Sunday afternoon, reaching a peak of 41C in Perth, beating the previous high of 40.1C set the week before. The city of Geraldton was the hottest place in Western Australia, with a high of 46.5C, followed by 46.2C in the town of Port Hedland. Beaches and outdoor swimming pools were packed, with thousands of Australians trying to cool down as they started their Christmas holidays. A heatwave warning remains in place for the entire length of the Western Australia coast, with temperatures expected to reach more than 40C in the Perth metropolitan area, and further inland likely to hit the mid-40s. Sunday’s maximum temperature also helped to break weather records for Perth, with 10 days so far in 2024 having reached highs of more than 40C, surpassing the previous record of nine days in 2007.likely The searing temperatures are expected to end abruptly as Christmas arrives, with a high of 31C expected on Tuesday, while Christmas Day is expected to only reach the mid-20s."
"The UK is home to more than 100m mature ash trees, and every spring tells the same grim story: leaves emerge, wither and drop within weeks, as ash dieback disease tightens its grip. Millions stand dead in woodlands and hedgerows across the British Isles, with an estimated 2bn seedlings and saplings at risk. Many experts have long feared the future of this cherished, ecologically important native tree hangs in the balance. But the latest scientific evidence tells a different story. Research suggests many of Britain’s ash trees might be more resilient than initially believed – and emerging solutions could help protect them. “A lot of trees are going to die,” said Dr Matt Combes, the tree epidemiologist at the University of Warwick and the lead author of a review article summarising various insights. “But ash dieback infection is not a death sentence.” Since the fungus responsible for ash dieback, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, was identified in 2006, it has been the subject of a concerted, international research effort. Combes’s co-author, Prof Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University, shared his measured optimism. “It’s probably not as bad as we were led to believe,” she said. Despite earlier predictions that up to 95% of UK’s ash trees would die, the latest Europe-wide data suggests average losses of 50% over the next 30 years, though some areas will be hit far harder. Since its arrival in Britain in the early 2000s, ash dieback has spread to every corner of the British Isles. “It’s part of the landscape now, so it’s [a question of] how do we live with it?” Combes said. Efforts to protect ash trees are advancing on three fronts, each offering potential solutions. 1. Breeding disease-tolerant ash trees While no trees appear immune, some exhibit only mild symptoms due to genetic factors that help them tolerate the disease. Since 2013, the Living Ash Project has been identifying these resilient trees and propagating them in the National Archive of Tolerant Ash. This government-funded programme aims to produce genetically diverse, disease-tolerant trees to repopulate affected areas. It is also identifying genetic markers that can be used to spot resistant trees in natural habitats. Though crucial, this work is slow, prompting some researchers to seek faster solutions. 2. Manage woodlands to build resilience A wide range of environmental factors can be decisive in an ash tree’s fate. Young trees generally fare worse than old; vigorous trees outperform stressed ones; and isolated trees often survive better than those in dense stands. Climate matters too – humid conditions accelerate the disease, while periods of intense summer heat can, surprisingly, help infected trees, by killing H. fraxineus. These insights are informing woodland management strategies. Though thinning ash-dense woods can help, government guidelines and tree experts, including the Woodland Trust, advise against felling infected trees unless they present a direct safety threat. This is important because it allows disease-tolerant trees to set seed and reproduce, vital for regenerating landscapes with young, hopefully resistant, ash. As a fast-growing pioneer species supporting at least a 1,000 other species, ash plays a crucial role in woodland succession. However, the success of this natural regeneration depends heavily on deer control. Rebecca Gosling, the Woodland Trust’s lead policy advocate on tree health and invasive species, emphasises that without coordinated, government-supported action on deer numbers, efforts to regenerate woodlands can “potentially just become a bit of a deer-feeding exercise”. Even trees that succumb to the disease have an important ecological role. Dead and dying trees provide essential habitats for species from fungi and insects to bats, owls and woodpeckers. Boddy said: “Woodlands in Britain are very depleted in nutrients. We’ve pillaged them [for timber] for thousands of years.” In her view, the dead wood generated by ash dieback can begin the long process of repaying this nutrient debt and restoring biodiversity and resilience to Britain’s woods. 3. Advance microbiome-based solutions Perhaps the most surprising new frontier involves the ash tree’s microbiome – the diverse communities of bacteria, fungi and other microbes that grow within and on them. Researchers in Germany and Poland have identified particular microbes that are specifically associated with disease-tolerant trees. Other studies have focused on viruses that infect the ash dieback fungus. These discoveries are being investigated as possible treatments. Experiments in Germany show that inoculating ash seedlings with specific bacteria can reduce disease severity. Researchers are also exploring fungi-targeting viruses as biological control agents – similar to new treatments developed for Chestnut blight, which decimated US chestnut forests in the 20th century. “I do think things like that are going to be the way forwards,” said Combes, though he acknowledged the challenges of applying inoculants at scale in natural woodlands. The Woodland Trust also welcomes this research but emphasised that unintended consequences were less likely if treatments used microbes native to the target landscape. The race to future-proof forests As the climate and biodiversity crises intensify, trees in Britain face an increasing array of threats. Erratic weather patterns weaken their defences, while new pests and pathogens are simultaneously expanding their ranges. The emerald ash borer offers a sobering example. This beetle, which has killed millions of ash trees across North America, is advancing from Asia into eastern Europe. Its march could present the European ash trees, already battling H. fraxineus, with a potentially devastating double threat. Combes, who is modelling how these two perils might interact, hopes ash dieback’s rapid spread will serve as a wake-up call. “We’ve always been on the back foot,” he said, noting that the fungus was only identified after it had reached Britain. But with the emerald ash borer and other emerging tree diseases, it is going to be vital to react sooner. The Observatree citizen project is mobilising this effort, with 200 trained volunteers across the UK watching for the earliest signs of 23 significant tree pests and pathogens. The government-funded research agency Forest Research is also pioneering a range of surveillance techniques, including sniffer dogs trained to identify tree diseases. Despite the challenges ahead, the rapid advances triggered by ash dieback in understanding tree genetics, environmental factors and protective microbes offer new tools for protecting Britain’s native trees. As Combes said: “If you think everything’s going to die, you can end up thinking what’s the point? But [thanks to scientific research] there are clear avenues and ways forward.”"
