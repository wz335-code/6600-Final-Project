0,0_0,0,"Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and rose all the way to its top but even he struggles to recall a Latin American year like 2019. “Like this? Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim became part of Brazil's foreign service almost sixty years ago and eventually reached the highest position. However, even he finds it hard to remember a year in Latin America quite like 2019. ""Like this? Never before,"" the former Brazilian foreign minister stated, referring to the troubled twelve months that saw social and political unrest shake the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the difficulties started with a burst of disagreement on the streets of Venezuela. Most people watching the situation were confident that it would remove its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Large-scale protests, excited predictions of Maduro's quick fall, and a failed military attempt followed, before Juan Guaidó's efforts to overthrow Hugo Chávez's successor lost momentum and a tense calm returned. But in other places, the events were just starting, as a series of protests and violence spread across Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales was forced to leave his position amid a violent military response. This made some people question whether a Latin American Spring had begun. In Peru, the president closed down congress. In Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner made a striking return to politics. And in Colombia, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the right-wing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, which was thought to be a safe and prosperous country in Latin America, was drawn into the chaos. An increase in subway ticket prices triggered its worst period of unrest in decades, leaving behind destruction and making President Sebastián Piñera's future uncertain. ""Where did that come from?"" wondered Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group's head for Latin America, as he considered Chile's unexpected involvement in the chaos. As a new year full of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he felt ""an acceleration of time"" in the region."
0,0_1,1,"“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","""Long-standing issues that have been developing over many years – such as the social divisions in Chile; Evo Morales' attempts to remain in power indefinitely in Bolivia; and the very tense and hostile situation in Venezuela – now appear to be becoming obvious in many different situations, leading to a point where we simply don't know what the future holds. ""I can identify the likely areas of conflict for next year,” he added. “However, I cannot predict exactly what will happen."" Some on the left in Latin America have found reassurance in this uncertainty. Amorim, aged 77, described the unrest as a popular ""response"" to the ""wave of neoliberal policies"" affecting countries from Colombia to Chile. ""It's very hard to say where we are heading,"" he stated. ""But one thing has changed: eight months ago, it seemed like everything was moving towards the right – completely towards the right. And now that's no longer so obvious. So that – despite all the difficulties – is a kind of improvement. Latin America is experiencing a period of instability. But [for the left] instability is preferable to stagnation."" As the year comes to an end, people are starting to think about what will happen next. In a recent report, the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a significant risk of ""protests spreading,"" noting how the protests in Colombia were influenced by uprisings in neighbouring countries. ""There is a strong possibility that 2020 will be another unstable year for Latin America,"" the report said, forecasting particularly difficult times in Ecuador under Lenín Moreno's leadership. ""It's like a time bomb,"" Amorim agreed. ""That [country] could explode again at any moment."" Briscoe identified three potential trouble spots for 2020: Venezuela, as it continues to suffer from political and humanitarian disaster; Brazil and Argentina, as the disagreement between their leaders with opposing political views intensifies; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to manage a record number of murders, with almost 100 lives being lost every day."""
0,0_2,2,"Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.","In 2014, massive protests shook Mexico after the disappearance of 43 students deeply affected the country. Briscoe warned that a similar situation could happen again if the violence didn't decrease. Briscoe also predicted trouble in Bolivia if the strongly right-wing activist Luis Fernando Camacho made it to the second round of new presidential elections and competed against a candidate from Evo Morales’s left-wing Movement Towards Socialism party. “I think we are heading for a very difficult period… In Colombia, Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, there's a possibility for things to go seriously wrong. We are facing a situation filled with widespread social dissatisfaction,"" Briscoe added, mentioning Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Chile as other possible ""areas of concern.""

Opinions are divided on whether Latin America's largest economy, Brazil, is at risk of experiencing unrest. Former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently encouraged his supporters to ""follow Chile’s example"" and protest against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some people argue that Bolsonaro's surprising election victory in 2018 has, for the time being, diverted anti-establishment anger away from street protests.

However, Monica de Bolle, a Latin America specialist from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, stated that Brazil could easily be the next country to experience social upheaval. ""At this precise moment, people are not likely to go out and protest on the streets. However, things are constantly changing, they are not fixed,"" she said. ""I believe it's highly likely that, sometime soon – and that could be in 2020 or by the end of 2020 – people will realise that the economy is not going to grow significantly because the necessary policies are not in place and there is no plan… and then Bolsonaro's support will decrease rapidly.""

""This could lead to something similar to what we've seen in Brazil in recent years, and it could even resemble the situation in 2013,"" she said, referring to the large-scale demonstrations that created the conditions for Dilma Rousseff's impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted that his country could face turmoil as public frustration with Bolsonaro's failures increases."

But perhaps not quite yet. “Everything here in Brazil is slow,” Amorim admitted. “Except samba.”","Amorim believes that widespread opposition to Bolsonaro hasn't surfaced yet, but he anticipates it will eventually. He suggested that a minor incident could quickly trigger a much larger response. However, he also acknowledged that this might not happen immediately.

1,1_0,0,"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago.","Demonstrators in Iraq have struck a symbolic blow against the United States by forcing their way into the American embassy in Baghdad. Diplomats were trapped inside while the protesters chanted slogans like “Death to America” and expressed their support for pro-Iranian armed groups. This was a humiliating day for the US government, as hundreds of protesters surrounded the US embassy complex. They even managed to break through the main gate and force their way into several reception areas. They started fires, broke down doors, and threw bricks at the bulletproof windows.

It seems the Iraqi security forces were complicit in the protest, as they allowed the demonstrators to enter the heavily guarded Green Zone. The protesters then proceeded to climb the walls of the embassy and throw stones. US security personnel responded by using tear gas but did not fire any weapons.

Donald Trump has accused Iran of organising the attack, which took place after US airstrikes on Sunday. The airstrikes targeted three sites in Iraq and two in Syria. These sites belonged to Kata’ib Hezbollah, an armed group supported by Iran, which is officially part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and many more were injured.

US officials stated that the airstrikes were a response to a rocket attack carried out by the group on a US base in Kirkuk on Friday. In that attack, one US contractor was killed, and four Americans were injured. President Trump authorised the operation on Saturday.

However, instead of achieving its intended goals, the airstrikes seem to be yet another in a string of foreign policy errors in the Middle East. The Iraqi government strongly condemned the airstrikes, and pro-Iranian armed groups promised to carry out further attacks against American targets, with the aim of forcing US troops to leave the country.

“Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.”

The US embassy has denied earlier reports from the Iraqi foreign ministry claiming that the ambassador and his staff were quickly evacuated as protesters moved towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the head of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a pre-arranged holiday and had left Baghdad the previous week."
1,1_1,1,"The embassy was under lockdown but had not been evacuated, the spokesperson said, with diplomats sheltering in a safe-room. Video from the scene showed thick grey smoke engulfing the compound against a backdrop of wailing from an emergency siren. Protesters shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. By nightfall fires were still burning. One masked man walked off insouciantly with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part.","According to the spokesperson, the embassy was under lockdown but hadn’t been evacuated, with diplomats finding shelter in a secure room.

One masked individual casually walked away with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service employees have drawn comparisons between these chaotic scenes and the 1979 attack on the US embassy in Tehran, during which 52 US citizens were taken hostage. However, the events of Tuesday weren't quite as extreme. Nobody was killed, and the main embassy building remained largely undamaged. Nevertheless, the potential for a greater conflict between US forces and Iranian-backed groups in Iraq is a significant concern. The Trump administration's strategy of imposing heavy sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran seems to have achieved very few noticeable diplomatic results, and has severely damaged relations with Iraq. Iraq’s Prime Minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – who maintains ties with both Iran and Washington – pledged on Tuesday to safeguard the safety and security of US personnel. After initially doing little to stop the violence, Iraqi security forces arrived in large numbers in the afternoon, creating a barrier between the angry crowds and the US security guards.

The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year.

3,3_0,0,"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said.","The Hungarian mangalica pig, a breed developed by an emperor and almost wiped out during the communist era, has had a challenging history spanning nearly two centuries. This large, robust pig, characterized by its woolly coat resembling a sheep's, is known as the hairiest and fattiest pig breed. Importantly, it's also considered one of the most delicious, according to many who appreciate it. After nearly becoming extinct thirty years ago, the mangalica has experienced a significant revival. Over the last decade, it has regained popularity on Hungarian farms, in Hungarian cuisine, and among the Hungarian population. More recently, it has become a sensation in high-end restaurants worldwide, from the United States to Japan. Its rich, marbled fat content has earned it the nickname ""Kobe pork"" in Japan. In Hungary, the mangalica breed has been officially recognized as a national treasure. However, this prized animal of Hungarian agriculture now faces a new danger: the spread of African swine fever across Eastern Europe, which has resulted in numerous animal slaughters to control the disease. The increasing demand for mangalica is also generating disagreements with neighbouring countries. A heated dispute arose earlier this month when a well-known American food blogger presented mangalica as a ""medieval Romanian food"" in a YouTube video that attracted nearly a million views. Underlying tensions continue regarding Hungary's historical control over parts of what is now Romanian territory, and the Hungarian media expressed considerable anger. ""It wasn't enough that they took Transylvania, trying to take our culture and historical memories... Now they also want to steal our mangalica,"" wrote the right-wing news website 888.hu. ""It could become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,"" said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary's Mangalica Breeders Association, during an interview in a fancy Budapest restaurant, while enjoying a plate of sliced mangalica ham. He emphasized that while all mangalica pigs currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig's historical roots are actually international."
3,3_1,1,"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic.","The Mangalica breed was developed in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna received a gift of 11 plump, long-haired pigs from the prince of Serbia. He arranged for these pigs to be crossbred with older Hungarian pig breeds near Arad, which is now located in Romania. At one point, Mangalica pigs made up 90% of the entire pig population in Hungary. Their high fat content was highly valued because the abundant lard they produced could be stored for much longer periods compared to meat. However, with the arrival of electricity and refrigeration, the demand for Mangalica lard decreased, and it became more of a luxury item. After World War II, the communist regime nearly wiped out the Mangalica breed. Only around 300 sows were kept in protected areas for scientific research. The meat itself became very difficult, if not impossible, to find. In the early 1990s, a young veterinary student named Tóth, who was studying in Spain, told a Spanish friend about these fatty Hungarian pigs. Together, they started a project with the aim of saving the Mangalica. “I placed advertisements in local newspapers, asking people to contact me if they had seen a Mangalica,” he remembered. He purchased all the Mangalica pigs he could find and, with Spanish investment, bred them for several years. By the late 1990s, they were ready to send the fatty pork to Spain for curing. Today, there are more than 200 Mangalica farmers in Hungary, and the meat is available for sale in almost every market. However, it costs approximately four times more than regular pork. Zsóka Fekete, who manages a Mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, explains: “It's unlike any other meat you've ever tasted. The texture is marbled, particularly in the neck area. It has a completely unique flavour.” Before 2012, she worked for a multinational company in Budapest. Then she decided to return to her family farm and purchase 20 Mangalica sows, which she has since expanded to a herd of 300. She has a loyal group of customers, including Michelin-starred restaurants and Mangalica enthusiasts in Budapest, who line up to buy her products when she travels to the capital every two weeks. The only significant threat facing the Mangalica breed at the moment is the outbreak of African swine fever."
3,3_2,2,"The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”","The first instances of the disease were discovered in Hungary's wild boar population last April. Although no domestic pigs have been infected with the virus yet, its extremely contagious nature means that whenever a dead boar infected with the disease is found, all pigs within a three-kilometer (two-mile) radius have to be killed. This is especially risky for the Mangalica breed, as they are kept in semi-open environments. New safety measures have been implemented, including the construction of double fences and a prohibition on farm visits. Up to now, approximately 1,200 Mangalica pigs have been slaughtered across Hungary, representing more than 10% of the entire population. According to Tóth, the government recently approved a special plan designed to protect the Mangalica breed if the situation worsens significantly. This plan involves setting up an emergency gene bank, and relocating the most valuable Mangalica animals to secure locations such as zoos or universities. Regarding concerns about the impact of meat consumption on the climate, it’s likely to be some time before this affects sales in Hungary, where pork is everywhere and vegetarianism is still viewed as an unusual eccentricity. However, Tóth surprisingly encourages Hungarians to reduce their meat intake.

4,4_0,0,"The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.","The widespread protests happening across India concerning the amendments to citizenship law, specifically the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, are encouraging. They demonstrate that Indian democracy is active and healthy at the local level, even though the current members of parliament have disregarded the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully discussed and created by the constituent assembly over three years. Its creators, experienced in nationalist resistance, managed to gain control from the colonial government in a remarkable demonstration of moral and political authority, clearly exposing the nature of British colonialism. As Henry Maine put it, British India was a ""most extraordinary experiment"" involving ""the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people."" The post-colonial state of India, which emerged in 1947, despite the violent internal conflict at its beginning, did, to some extent, keep its promise to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty, and equality for all for the next 70 years. The current constitutional problem India faces is the result of a rushed and religiously motivated act that contradicts the vision of the founders of this great and diverse nation and its significant constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of South Asian History, University of Sussex.

Regarding your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), I agree that it is terrible, and I appreciate you bringing it to light. However, I would be grateful if you would begin to include the responsibility of England for colonialism in Canada, starting with Rupert's Land. This land was taken over with a simple signature in 1670, which led to the exploitation of the region by the Hudson Bay Company. Virtually everything about modern-day Canada originates in England. England has benefited significantly from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the current Canadian government for continuing these practices, but your article doesn’t adequately acknowledge the historical context that assigns responsibility where it truly belongs."

5,5_0,0,"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family’s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian café, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again.","The restaurant industry has suffered greatly from the bitterness surrounding Brexit. The declining value of the pound has increased the cost of ingredients, while unclear information about the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK has created many problems for staff, particularly those who work with customers. Although we now have a definite date for leaving the EU at the end of January, things don't seem likely to get better in 2020. In fact, restaurant owners and chefs are saying that it's more difficult than ever to keep employees who aren't from the UK, as they understandably wonder if they have a secure future here. A similar issue exists in the food processing sector, where workers from Eastern Europe have traditionally made up a large part of the workforce. When it's hard to keep staff, companies usually have to raise salaries to encourage them to stay, and these increased costs will be passed on to customers. Therefore, expect prices to go up in the hospitality and food industries in the coming year.

At the end of 2019, the journal *Lancet Planetary Health* published a letter from a group of scientists from around the world who are concerned about the climate crisis. They called on countries to announce when they expect livestock production to reach its highest point, after which it should no longer increase. We've already seen a shift away from eating meat in everyday life, demonstrated by the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year, we will see an even bigger move towards vegetarian and vegan cooking. Expect more well-known food chains to expand their non-meat options on their menus.

Regarding culinary trends, there are indications that African food traditions might finally gain recognition, at least in London. After several successful temporary restaurants, Chuku's, a restaurant in Tottenham that specializes in Nigerian cuisine, will open a permanent location in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, who was a finalist on *MasterChef: The Professionals* last year, will open Akoko in Fitzrovia, which will feature West African influences.

**Three to watch:**

**Nisha Katona:** She used to be a lawyer, but she gave it all up to explore her family's Indian heritage through the familiar home cooking she offers at her Indian café, Mowgli. What began as a single restaurant in her hometown of Liverpool has grown into a group of ten, with plans to open at least four more in 2020, and the contracts have been agreed for a similar number again."
5,5_1,1,"Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.","Daniel Humm is the newest addition to the group of American chefs who have come to Britain, hoping to achieve great success. He has been awarded three Michelin stars for his restaurant, Eleven Madison Park in New York, and has recently opened a new restaurant at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair. This location was previously home to Simon Rogan’s Fera, and before that, to Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant. However, neither of them managed to create a really thriving business there. Humm will be hoping that Davies and Brook, named after the two streets where Claridge’s is located, will prove to be successful.

It's important to remember that this kind of exchange happens in both directions. In March, Will Beckett and Huw Gott, the team responsible for the highly respected Hawksmoor group, are making their most ambitious move yet: they are opening a steakhouse in New York, a city widely considered the best place to find a good steak. It will certainly be fascinating to see what New Yorkers think of the British interpretation of steak.

Next year, world leaders will have a crucial opportunity to try and control the climate crisis that threatens the entire planet. On November 9th, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 conference in Glasgow, aiming to agree on reductions in carbon emissions that could limit global temperature increases to well below 2°C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, and that this could rise to 3°C or 4°C by the end of this century. The consequences could include increasingly severe storms, rising sea levels, expanding deserts, crop failures, and deadly heatwaves, all of which would endanger lives across the globe. Throughout most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be focused on preparing for the Glasgow talks. The aim is to encourage nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries regarding the fight against climate change. Developing countries argue that the industrialized world is primarily responsible for the majority of historical carbon emissions, yet is still not doing enough to reduce them. They are also requesting that wealthy nations provide at least $100 billion annually to assist them in mitigating the worst effects of global warming and to lower emissions. Attempts to find common ground between the two sides have so far been unsuccessful."
5,5_2,2,"Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously – threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future. Temperatures also reached record highs in Australia, triggering continent-wide bushfires, while in Africa, the Victoria Falls – one of the planet’s greatest cascades of water – dried to a trickle in 2019.

But if he loses next year’s presidential election, on 3 November, and a Democrat wins, the US would rejoin talks in 2021. Claire Perry O’Neill As president of COP26, it will be the principal job of the former Tory MP to ensure the talks are successful. Politics The UK’s membership of the European Union will be terminated at the end of January, but that’s not Brexit done. We then enter a transition period while there are tough and complex negotiations about the future relationship with our closest neighbours and most important trading partners. Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters. There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020. The SNP will demand it, but without any real conviction that it can get one from a Conservative government that has set an adamantine face against the idea. This refusal will suit the Nationalists.","Greenland's ice sheet is currently melting at a rate seven times faster than it was in the 1990s. Furthermore, the West Antarctic ice sheet is now showing signs of dangerous instability, posing a threat of rising sea levels. This rise could have catastrophic consequences for low-lying areas like Bangladesh and various Pacific islands in the near future. To add to these concerns, Australia experienced record high temperatures, which led to devastating bushfires across the entire continent. In Africa, Victoria Falls, one of the most impressive waterfalls on Earth, almost completely dried up in 2019, reduced to a mere trickle. The upcoming Glasgow climate talks will be taking place against this concerning ecological situation.

Here are three individuals to keep an eye on:

*   **Greta Thunberg:** Can this activist maintain the current momentum of the climate protest movement?

*   **Donald Trump:** He is in the process of withdrawing the United States from international climate agreements, a process scheduled to be completed by November 4, 2020. However, if he loses the presidential election the day before, on November 3rd, and a Democrat wins, the US could rejoin the discussions in 2021.

*   **Claire Perry O’Neill:** As the president of COP26, this former Member of Parliament's main responsibility will be to ensure that the climate talks are a success.

On the political front, the UK's membership of the European Union will end at the close of January. However, this does not mean Brexit is fully completed. A transition period will begin, during which complex and challenging negotiations will take place regarding the future relationship with the EU, the UK’s closest neighbours and most significant trading partners. Boris Johnson claims he can achieve a free trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas without needing to align UK regulations with those of the EU. The EU, on the other hand, suggests it will never agree to such a deal. The Conservative leader has further increased the pressure by stating that the UK will leave the transition period without a deal if an agreement is not reached by the end of the year. The question is, will he actually take such a significant risk with the British economy, especially considering the potential impact on manufacturers and the livelihoods of voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him win his majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will be called, or he will be seen to be betraying these new Conservative voters.

Finally, there will not be another referendum on Scottish independence in 2020. The Scottish National Party (SNP) will demand one, but without genuine confidence that they can persuade a Conservative government, which is strongly opposed to the idea, to grant one. This rejection will actually suit the Nationalists."
5,5_3,3,"Current polling suggests that they can’t be confident of winning a referendum now, and a second defeat would surely kill their ambition for a long time. The SNP’s true aim is to stoke Scottish resentment against Westminster to pave the way for a big win in the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That’s the year with the potential for a constitutional car crash that rips apart the kingdom. Both the Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the latter contest, which is expected to climax around March. Expect bitter rows about the election process as the Corbynites who control the party’s national executive committee try to fix the terms of the battle to favour their continuity candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey. Labour moderates are already saying that the succession of a beardless variation of Jeremy Corbyn will doom Labour to another decade in opposition. If that happens, the moderates will be asking whether the party is dead to them and they should try something different.

The SNP's real goal is to increase feelings of resentment in Scotland towards the UK government in Westminster, in order to achieve a significant victory in the Scottish parliamentary elections in 2021. That year has the potential to be a constitutional disaster that could break up the United Kingdom.

Both the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party will be choosing new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the Labour leadership contest, which is expected to reach its peak around March. We should anticipate intense disagreements about the election process, as the Corbyn supporters who control the party's national executive committee will likely attempt to manipulate the rules of the contest to benefit their preferred candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey.

More moderate members of the Labour Party are already suggesting that if a very similar candidate to Jeremy Corbyn, but without a beard, succeeds him, Labour will be destined for another ten years in opposition. If that happens, these moderates will be questioning whether the party is finished for them and whether they should try a different approach.

Here are three people to watch, according to Andrew Rawnsley:

**Boris Johnson:** He has made many promises regarding Brexit, the National Health Service, and investment in the north of England. Will he be able to keep these promises, or will his government begin to face difficulties in 2020?

**Nicola Sturgeon:** Following a convincing victory in Scotland in the December 2019 general election, everyone will be watching the leader of the SNP in the coming year to see how she manages to take advantage of her popularity in her campaign for Scottish independence.

**Rebecca Long Bailey:** She faces a difficult battle against an increasing number of candidates for the Labour Party leadership. Will the party members support the obvious successor to Corbyn, or will they want something different for the party?

Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew’s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein’s alleged victims’ lawyers’ relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, meanwhile, are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold and risky strategy in taking on the press over privacy. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter to her estranged father.","Vanessa Thorpe’s Predictions: Three People to Keep an Eye On

Johnny Flynn: Already known to viewers of the 2018 television adaptations of *Les Miserables* and *Vanity Fair*, this actor is set to have a very successful year. He’s playing David Bowie in the film *Stardust*, and also appears as a surprisingly blond Mr. Knightley in the adaptation of Jane Austen’s *Emma*, acting alongside Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart. Furthermore, another British film called *The Dig*, which is about an archaeologist, is also scheduled for release soon, meaning we’ll be seeing him on cinema screens quite a bit.

Nicky Morgan: The recently reappointed culture secretary, now working from the more peaceful environment of the House of Lords, will be approached by numerous arts organizations, venues and institutions which are all desperately seeking funding. The questions are: will she remain in this role for a significant period, and, if she does, will she actually listen to these requests?

Adele: Speculation surrounding the release date of her highly anticipated fourth album (possibly titled *30*?) is likely to intensify dramatically after she’s spent the last few years away from the public eye, which have been quite eventful.

The Royal Family: Following a year filled with difficulties, the royal family faces a challenging 2020 as they try to stabilize the monarchy. The Queen, who will be 94 in April, seems increasingly isolated as the Duke of Edinburgh, who will turn 99 in June, spends much of his time alone on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Decisions made by certain members of the family have raised doubts about how much the Queen is consulted by those who may be motivated to pursue their own individual plans. Prince Andrew’s shocking television interview with Emily Maitlis on Newsnight may have brought Pizza Express in Woking to public attention, and caused many people to search online for medical conditions that prevent sweating. However, any hopes that it would calm the intense discussion about his relationship with the late, disgraced American financier Jeffrey Epstein were completely unfounded. With lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims continuing to push relentlessly to involve the Prince in their legal battle in the US, this extended situation looks set to continue, even though Andrew has stepped back from public duties for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold, but potentially risky, strategy to challenge the press over issues of privacy. Meghan is currently suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter she wrote to her estranged father."

6,6_0,0,"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","Mark Carney, the current governor of the Bank of England who is about to leave his post, has stated that all companies and financial organisations need to explain why they are continuing to invest in fossil fuels. He also cautioned that assets in this area could eventually become ""worthless.""

In an interview set to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday, Carney said that although the financial industry is beginning to reduce its investments in oil and gas companies, this change isn't happening fast enough.

Carney, who will be concentrating on his new position as the UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he leaves his role as governor in the new year, agreed to appear on the program for an edition that was edited by Greta Thunberg, a climate change activist. Thunberg was one of several guest editors on Today during the holiday period.

Carney has been one of the most outspoken central bank governors regarding the need for the financial sector to do more to move towards an economy with no carbon emissions. He told the programme that the climate crisis is a ""tragedy waiting to happen"" and that more extreme weather events are unavoidable. ""By the time these extreme events become widespread and obvious, it will be too late to take any action,"" he said. He believes political leaders need to ""start dealing with future problems immediately.""

Regarding whether investors should be selling their investments in fossil fuel companies, Carney said that fund managers would ""have to make their own decisions and justify them to the people whose money they are managing."" When asked directly if pension funds should sell off their investments in oil and gas companies, even if those investments are profitable, he responded: ""Well, that hasn't been the situation so far, but they might argue that it is. They need to clearly explain why that will continue to be the case, if a large portion of those assets are likely to become worthless.""

He warned: ""If we were to burn all of those oil and gases, there’s no way we could meet our carbon emission targets. As much as 80% of coal assets will become useless, and up to half of the oil reserves that have been developed. The question is for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurance company: what is your plan?""

The Bank of England has said that assets with a value of up to $20 trillion (£16 trillion) could rapidly lose their value if the financial industry and businesses don't make a smooth transition towards an economy with no carbon emissions."

Complaining about how much internal opposition there had been to this item being included, Moore accused the BBC of “climate change alarmism”.","During his interview, Carney strongly encouraged those who deny climate change to abandon their resistance to the issue, stating, ""We simply can't afford to have biased information, misleading arguments, or intentional deception on this matter.""

He included a segment in his programme that questioned the widespread agreement about the seriousness of the climate crisis.

Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.","A man who was shot and killed in the centre of Moscow after he started shooting at the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s primary intelligence agency, has been identified as someone very interested in guns.

On Thursday evening, Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon, hitting the windows of the intelligence agency’s main headquarters in Lubyanka with bullets from the street. One FSB employee died at the scene. Another FSB officer died in hospital on Friday evening because of the injuries he sustained. One more FSB officer was seriously wounded, and three other people, including a member of the public, suffered less serious injuries. Officials stated that Manyurov was then killed by an FSB sniper. Officers found grenades and a homemade bomb in a bag he was carrying. Security officials said that Manyurov did not manage to get inside the Lubyanka building, which used to be the main offices of the KGB, the secret police from the Soviet era. Russian media outlets have described the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a solitary person with an obsession for firearms. He was unemployed, but he had previously worked as a security guard, even at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, according to what his father told Russian media. Recently, Manyurov had come third in a shooting competition organised by a patriotic sports group with military elements that dates back to Soviet times and was brought back into use by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, in 2009.

It is believed that he used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during the attack on Thursday. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov trained, said that he was not a very good shot and would often arrive at the shooting range wearing a long black Parka raincoat with the hood pulled up. “We suggested that he take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable wearing it,” Solovich told the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda."

She said he was unmarried, with no children or close friends, and that he was passionate about guns. He appears to have had no social media presence. The assault on the FSB office took place shortly after Putin’s annual press conference in Moscow. The president was attending a gala concert at the nearby Kremlin in honour of the security services during the shootout. The attack may have been planned to coincide with the speech, an FSB source told Reuters. Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process.","While the reason behind the attack is still not clear, the daily newspaper Kommersant has reported that witnesses informed investigators he was yelling phrases commonly used by the Islamic State.

Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor.

9,9_0,0,"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes. CGT union workers also voted to halt production at Total’s Grandpuits refinery.","French railway workers who are on strike have had confrontations with riot police in Paris. This happened after they held a demonstration to protest against changes to the pension system, even though President Emmanuel Macron had asked them to stop striking over the Christmas period.

On Monday morning, hundreds of union members and striking workers gathered outside the Gare de Lyon train station. This station is usually very busy with people travelling south for Christmas holidays or to ski resorts in the Alps, but many train services have been cancelled. Some of the striking workers gave speeches criticizing the government's plans to change the pension system and promised to continue striking through Christmas and into the new year.

The protesters set off flares and fireworks, and the smoke from these drifted down into the main area of the station. Riot police, wearing helmets and carrying shields, were stationed at the ticket barriers.

These nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the national rail company, SNCF, described as ""significant and ongoing disruption"" to services. Most unions and ordinary rail workers ignored the President’s request for a break over Christmas, as passengers waited in long lines at ticket offices, trying to find seats on the few trains that were running. Some train journeys were shortened, and some train services were replaced by buses.

Around 48% of people who had tickets for high-speed and intercity trains had their services cancelled on the 23rd and 24th of December. This left many people struggling to find alternative ways to travel, like car-sharing or renting a car at the last minute.

There was also severe disruption on the Paris Metro and on local trains in the area surrounding the capital. Large crowds of people gathered at the Gare du Nord station to catch the reduced number of trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to get to airports near Paris complained that taxis were difficult to find, and some drivers were charging higher prices than usual – more than the fixed rate – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so heavy.

Other people were worried about how they would get back home at the end of the Christmas holidays, as the strikes were planned to continue into January.

Meanwhile, production has been stopped at the Lavera oil refinery in the south of France, which processes 210,000 barrels of oil each day.

The government has insisted it will push ahead with attempts to unify the French pension system, arguing that removing 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Opéra de Paris staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any age-related changes. Unions are angry at government plans to introduce a “pivot age” – keeping the legal retirement age at 62 but insisting on an additional two years of work to receive a full pension.","Emmanuel Lepine, the general secretary of the CGT's oil division, announced on France Info radio that CGT members at other refineries across France might also vote to stop production. “We warned the government, but they didn’t listen, so we’re carrying out exactly what we said we would,” Lepine explained. “Our demand is that the reform is cancelled.” Government officials have started planning another series of negotiations with the unions in the next few weeks, before another national day of protests scheduled for January 9th. The government maintains that it will continue with its plans to create a single French pension system, arguing that getting rid of the 42 different and “special” pension schemes currently in place for sectors like railway workers, energy employees, lawyers, and even staff at the Opéra de Paris, is essential to ensure the system remains financially sustainable as the population gets older. Although some unions are in favour of a unified system, almost all of them are against any changes that involve age.

In Germany, however, where the sale of fireworks has been banned to discourage crowds and authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”, Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final new year’s address as chancellor that she had never found the old year so heavy.","In Sydney, fireworks exploded in the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour beneath was noticeably empty. In New York, Times Square was almost completely deserted. The Beijing TV tower remained unlit, without its usual dazzling light show. Celebrations around the world were limited by lockdowns and curfews put in place to control the spread of Covid-19. As a result, the lion statues in London’s Trafalgar Square were fenced off, St Peter’s Square in Rome was empty of crowds, and no one was diving into the Tiber River. This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated unlike any other, as many people say goodbye to a year they'd rather forget – a year in which over 1.7 million people have died and 82 million have been infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, which usually attracts crowds of a million people to its harbour area for its impressive fireworks display, welcomed 2021 with a shorter show. Most of the popular viewing locations were fenced off, and a large police presence discouraged people from visiting. Only those with restaurant bookings or who were guests of inner-city residents were permitted entry. “What a terrible year it has been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, the Premier of New South Wales. “Hopefully 2021 will be kinder to us all.” In Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic began a year ago, thousands of people gathered in popular areas of the city centre to countdown to 2021. Some said they were being careful but weren't especially concerned. In New Zealand, which successfully eliminated the coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year's Eve celebrations went ahead as normal. However, in Germany, where the sale of fireworks has been prohibited to prevent crowds from gathering, and where Berlin authorities stated that police would ""strictly punish anyone breaking the rules,"" Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final New Year's address as Chancellor that she had never felt the past year so difficult."
11,11_1,1,"“And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope,” said Merkel, a trained physicist who won praise for taming the first virus wave but has drawn criticism for soaring infection and death numbers in the second. She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve.","“Despite all the concerns and a degree of doubt, we have never looked forward to a new year with as much hope as this one,” said Merkel. The trained physicist was praised for successfully controlling the initial wave of the virus, but has faced criticism due to the increased infection and death rates during the second wave. She strongly criticised those protesting against lockdowns and spreading conspiracy theories about vaccines. “I can only imagine how painful it must be for those grieving the loss of loved ones to coronavirus, or struggling with the long-term effects of the illness, to hear some misguided individuals questioning and denying the existence of the virus,” Merkel stated. The health minister, Jens Spahn, commented that he anticipated the country would experience the ""quietest New Year's Eve"" in anyone’s living memory.

In France, no more than six adults will be permitted to gather for New Year's Eve celebrations. One hundred thousand police officers and gendarmes will be deployed to prevent any public gatherings. Some regions have banned the sale of alcohol, and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, has instructed law enforcement to strictly enforce the national curfew, which runs from 8 pm to 6 am. This is part of an effort to ""combat illegal public gatherings and instances of urban violence.”

In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday as a result of a surge linked to a new variant of Covid, people intending to celebrate New Year's Eve were advised that they would have to postpone their parties until later in 2021, as ""Covid thrives in crowded environments."" Professor Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, stated that remaining at home and celebrating 2021 ""within the rules"" would decrease infections and ease the burden on hospitals. “It is absolutely essential that everyone continues to follow the guidelines this year by staying at home and avoiding mixing with others,” he said. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, also encouraged people to adhere to the regulations and ""celebrate the New Year safely at home."" Barriers have been put up in public areas, such as Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square in London.

In Italy, the European country with the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants, and most shops were closed, and a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am was in effect for New Year’s Eve."
11,11_2,2,"Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility. In New York, the New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway but in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said.","Due to a sudden worsening of his sciatica, Pope Francis had to cancel his scheduled appearances at the New Year's Eve and New Year's Day services, the Vatican announced. Meanwhile, in his New Year's speech delivered on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his hope that Russians would come together to overcome the country's struggle with the coronavirus. He admitted that a second wave of infections was still significantly impacting Russia. ""Regrettably, the epidemic is not yet completely under control,"" Putin stated in his address, which was to be broadcast shortly before midnight in each of Russia's eleven time zones. He emphasized that ""the battle against it continues non-stop,"" and acknowledged the many healthcare professionals who would be ""working hard throughout this holiday night,"" while also calling for people to act responsibly. In New York City, the traditional New Year's Eve ball drop would still happen in Times Square. However, instead of the usual hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers crowded together, the audience would be limited to a small, carefully chosen group of nurses, doctors, and other essential workers, with their families kept at a safe distance in designated areas to maintain social distancing. Concerned about the ongoing spread of Covid-19, the police closed Times Square to both vehicles and pedestrians starting at midnight on Wednesday. They also announced that they would disperse anyone attempting to enter the ""frozen zone"" – the blocks surrounding the ball drop location that typically attract huge crowds packed closely together. As police chief Terence Monahan warned, ""If you believe you can simply stand there and watch the ball drop, you are mistaken."""
12,12_0,0,"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","It's been a difficult year for many people, and the elephants at the Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, have also had a tough time. When the pandemic started in March, the country went into a strict national lockdown. This meant the sanctuary's many elephants could no longer go on their daily 30-mile walks, which are essential for them to stretch their legs and help their digestion. They started to develop health problems, which were made worse by a general feeling of sadness that affected both the humans and the other animals living at the sanctuary.

Ankit Pareek, who manages the Elefanjoy sanctuary, explained, “The elephants could feel the stress and anxiety of the people around them. Many of them became depressed because they weren't getting their usual exercise and the fun they had with the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them, and take photos. We were very worried about the elephants.”

But Pareek had even bigger worries because he relied entirely on the money and donations from tourists. Elephants eat up to 200 kilograms of food each day, which is about 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees (£51) daily to feed each elephant. ""We didn't want the elephants to suffer in any way; they deserve only love and respect, so we have taken out loans to cover the cost of their food,"" said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. ""But if foreign tourists don't come back soon, the situation will be very bad for us.""

Animal rights campaigners have been pointing out for a long time that the training of elephants kept for tourism is cruel and harmful. In countries like India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is normally a profitable and growing industry, the lack of tourists has created a new crisis for animal welfare. However, activists are hoping that this break in tourism will finally put an end to this exploitation of animals.

In September, four elephants that had been trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) discovered that they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water after the pandemic started, which caused serious health problems that led to their deaths. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said, ""For years, we have been documenting how poor the conditions are for captive elephants in India."""
12,12_1,1,"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","The Covid-19 pandemic has made all the long-standing problems we've been highlighting much worse, and now elephants are dying as a result. According to Mehrotra, a major concern is the limited number of elephant sanctuaries in India, only about eight, and the fact that most of them aren't equipped to accommodate the growing number of elephants that are now ""out of work"" and consequently going hungry. Many of India's 1,800 privately owned elephants usually earn money through their participation in Hindu festival ceremonies, called pujas, or in wedding parades, but these events are currently prohibited due to pandemic restrictions. While the governments of Kerala and Rajasthan provided some financial assistance to elephant owners during the lockdown period, these payments have since stopped, and other states offered no support whatsoever. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, from Tamil Nadu, whose family owns two 40-year-old elephants named Lakshmi and Kusma, has turned to social media videos and a crowdfunding campaign in an attempt to raise money for his own elephants and others who are facing similar difficulties. ""I'm very concerned about elephants throughout India,"" he stated. ""People are reluctant to admit publicly that they're struggling to care for their elephants and need financial assistance because they fear being unfairly treated."" In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants were kept in tourist camps, these captive animals are now frequently being abandoned. Although the government provided some help by distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps were forced to shut down completely. This led to a mass movement of elephants across Thailand, with around 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, which were often also their birthplaces, places they hadn't seen for many years. In March, three female elephants named Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert's Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler requested a temporary stay at Sangdeaun's sanctuary. However, by the next morning, he had disappeared. He later called to explain that he simply didn't have the resources to provide for the animals. ""It's similar to when people bring their dog to the vet and then abandon it. I thought this kind of thing only happened with dogs or cats. Now they are leaving elephants with us,"" Sangdeaun explained."
12,12_2,2,"Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, the president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said the number of callers asking for veterinary assistance had grown since March. Patitta Traiwet, the president of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has branches across Thailand, said she had managed to maintain the animals’ routine but the elephants had noticed the absence of tourists lining up to give them bananas and pineapples. “They were confused at the beginning – where are the people? Why is nobody feeding me banana?” she said. Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth. Many people now hope that even when the tourists return, these elephants will remain resettled in their natural habitat for good. Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol","Her sanctuary is home to 97 elephants, most of whom are older and have been ""retired"" from working in riding and trekking camps, where tourists ride on their backs. According to Sangdeaun, the current difficult situation has led to a significant drop in the price of elephants in Thailand, with their value being reduced by more than half. Just a year ago, a young elephant could have fetched as much as $100,000, but now that same animal might be sold for only $40,000. She is concerned that families who have cared for elephants for many generations might no longer be able to afford to keep them. She fears they may be forced to sell them off at low prices to large companies. For elephants that remain in Thailand's tourist camps, life involves being kept in chains for extended periods. Sangdeaun explained, ""They become sad and unhappy, and they get so annoyed that they end up fighting each other."" Some camps have cut back on the number of mahouts, the elephant keepers, which means there are fewer people to take care of the elephants' needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, who leads the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, has noted an increase in the number of calls asking for veterinary help since March. Patitta Traiwet, who heads the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has several locations throughout Thailand, said that she has been able to keep the animals' daily schedule consistent. However, she has noticed that the elephants are aware of the absence of tourists who used to queue up to feed them bananas and pineapples. ""At first, they were puzzled - where are all the people? Why isn't anyone giving me a banana?"" she commented. On a more positive note, for the hundreds of elephants that have gone back to their original homes with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic might have offered them an opportunity to play freely in the jungles and rivers where they were born. Many now hope that even when tourism picks up again, these elephants will be allowed to stay resettled in their natural environment permanently. This story was also reported on by Navaon Siradapuvadol."
13,13_0,0,"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","The idea that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus is more easily transmitted is supported by research suggesting it’s associated with larger amounts of the virus in people’s respiratory systems. This variant, called B117, was identified during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent were still increasing during the November lockdown. Scientists noticed that it continued to spread despite the restrictions, while other, older versions of the virus were declining.

Some of the large-scale testing centres, set up in places like London and Manchester to increase Covid-19 testing capacity, started to see signs of the new variant in respiratory samples. This happened around the time the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium raised concerns about B117 and its ability to spread more easily.

Dr. Michael Kidd, from the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed 641 samples taken from people showing symptoms of the virus. They found evidence of B117 alongside other variants. According to their study, which is still being reviewed by other experts, about 35% of patients infected with B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared to only 10% of patients infected with other variants.

“It appears that patients with this variant have higher amounts of the virus in their system, which suggests they could spread it to other people more easily,” Dr. Kidd explained. However, he warned that the data was initial and more evidence was needed before making definite conclusions.

Scientists are fairly confident that B117 is more transmissible. A study using models, conducted by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, estimated that it spreads around 56% more easily than previous variants.

There are several possible reasons why it might be more transmissible. For example, if the variant is more infectious, it means fewer virus particles are needed in the infected person to pass the virus on to someone else. The virus might also multiply more quickly in the airways, or infected people could remain infectious for a longer period, increasing their chances of spreading the virus.

“The specific way in which this variant achieves such a high amount of virus is another important question,” said Dr. Kidd. He also mentioned that laboratory tests are required to fully understand the biological reasons for its transmission advantage."
13,13_1,1,"“Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death. But a higher rate of transmissibility without strict controls could still lead to more death. • This article was corrected on 30 December 2020. The higher viral load was found in respiratory samples, not blood samples as an earlier version stated.","""Just like putting together a jigsaw puzzle, we need to look at other pieces of evidence to get the full picture. I believe the significance of this study – even though it's initial research and needs to be carried out again to confirm the findings – is that it provides a practical, real-world explanation for why this particular virus might be able to spread more easily. This is because those who are infected appear to be more contagious. Initial information indicates that the UK variant doesn't seem to make people more ill, nor does it increase the chances of getting infected again or dying. However, if the virus spreads much faster and we don't have strong control measures in place, it could still result in a greater number of deaths. • This article was updated on December 30, 2020, to correct an error.

14,14_0,0,"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Doctors are worried that hospitals may soon have to make incredibly difficult decisions about which Covid-19 patients will receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is under such extreme pressure. This warning came as more and more people called for a new national lockdown across the UK. There were also suggestions that schools should delay reopening after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help slow down the massive increase in coronavirus infections. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday that the health service is struggling to manage the record number of Covid cases. The situation is so serious that some patients may be refused access to an intensive care unit or the chance to be put on a ventilator.

The pressure for the government to take stronger action against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to inform Members of Parliament on Wednesday about how effective the tiered system of restrictions in England is in controlling the resurgence of the virus. The Health Secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England, which would be stricter than tier 4, the level already in place in London and much of southern England. He may also move areas currently in tier 3 into tier 4 in an attempt to stop the rapid rise in infections, which reached a new record of 53,135 on Tuesday. Scotland already has a five-tier system.

A growing number of hospitals are getting close to being overwhelmed by the number of patients who need emergency care because of Covid-19. To clearly illustrate the growing crisis, some intensive care units in London, which is again the worst-affected area in England, are now so full that doctors have requested that some patients be moved hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to find a bed and help ease the pressure on their services, according to the Health Service Journal. In another clear example, the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s ward to another hospital to free up space to accommodate adults suffering from Covid and other illnesses. Staff were also told in an email on Tuesday that the hospital has decided to convert the acute admissions unit at Barnet General Hospital, which it manages, into extra capacity for Covid patients."

Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action. Referring to the Tiers review, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: “It will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people to the highest level.” A toughening is needed urgently because pressures on the NHS in some places is “rising at an unsustainable rate”, she said. Keir Starmer sounded a stark warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian that the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January. Dr Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS and president of the HCSA, said ICU staff may end up having to in effect ration who received care that could help them survive. “Our NHS just doesn’t have the beds to cope. Some areas will be overwhelmed in days. If ventilation capacity is exceeded, horrendous choices will have to be made over those who live and die.","A senior manager at the hospital trust, which is currently treating 424 patients admitted with Covid-19, stated that the London Gold meeting has indicated that the situation is expected to get worse over the next two weeks, with the peak demand for critical care beds potentially occurring around January 4th.

They argued that any delay would result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise be saved. The committee, led by Sir David King, the government's former chief scientific advisor, also recommended that schools should remain closed until the beginning of February. They believe that the planned reopening from next week could worsen the already rapidly deteriorating situation, especially considering the new, more easily transmitted variant that also appears to infect people under 18 more readily. ""The situation is as critical as it has ever been. What's really worrying is that it's going to continue to get worse. We need to take action now to prevent the NHS from collapsing in a few weeks. It is that serious,” said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent SAGE and professor of operational research at University College London. NHS Providers, an organization that represents hospital trusts in England, also called for stronger action. Referring to the review of the tier system, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: ""This will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people into the highest level of restrictions."" She added that a tightening of restrictions is urgently needed because the pressures on the NHS in some areas are ""increasing at an unsustainable rate."" Keir Starmer issued a serious warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the coming month. The Labour leader told The Guardian that the UK was ""facing the prospect"" of a third lockdown in January. Dr. Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS and president of the HCSA, warned that ICU staff might be forced to effectively ration life-saving care. “Our NHS simply doesn’t have enough beds to cope. Some areas will be overwhelmed within days. If we run out of ventilation equipment, horrific choices will have to be made about who lives and who dies."""
14,14_2,2,"“The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days.","She explained that difficult decisions would need to be made, such as choosing which patients should be admitted to intensive care and which patients could only receive a more basic level of care, without the possibility of intensive care. They might also have to decide how long to continue providing maximum treatment for a patient who doesn't seem to be improving, especially if another patient arrives needing a haemodialysis machine when only a limited number are available. Another tough choice would be determining who gets a bed in intensive care or access to a ventilator if all beds are currently occupied.

Paoloni also cautioned that hospitals might be forced to suspend non-Covid-related treatments, possibly even cancer surgery, despite assurances from NHS England that they would try to maintain these services during the second wave. A hospital might have to ask itself, ""Can we proceed with the cancer surgery today, considering we have a limited number of beds and no spare intensive care capacity to handle any emergencies if we use the last available bed for a major cancer operation?""

She further added that disease screening programs, like those for cancer, might also have to be put on hold, and patients might experience longer waiting times for ambulances responding to emergency calls. Facing the most critical emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals within the NHS are considering setting up triage tents outside their buildings. This response is due to the long lines of ambulances accumulating outside many A&E departments, with patients sometimes spending hours inside the vehicles awaiting admission.

On Tuesday, ambulances were observed queuing outside hospitals like the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, Queen's Hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Dr. Simon Walsh, an A&E consultant and the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, revealed the tent plan, noting that such measures are usually reserved for major incidents like terrorist attacks or industrial accidents.

Walsh stated that NHS staff are preparing for a ""worsening, increasing number of admissions"" related to Covid in the coming weeks, as the number of infections continues to increase rapidly. He urged the government to develop a plan to address the growing chaos within the healthcare system. The Doctors’ Association UK commented that Covid had caused ""a cataclysmic escalation"" in the pressure the NHS has been under in recent days."

Richard Mitchell, the chief executive of the Sherwood Forest group of hospitals in Nottinghamshire, posted on Twitter that the current day would be challenging. He added that the following day might be even more difficult, and that the next two weeks would probably be the busiest and most demanding period the NHS has ever experienced.

In response to these concerns, the Department of Health and Social Care said that there is an adequate supply of ventilators available and that they have sufficient oxygen to satisfy the current needs.

The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango.","Throughout the pandemic, technology has helped us keep our jobs and maintain our mental well-being.

15,15_1,1,"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","This sudden resurgence of interest in reading is perhaps not surprising in a city that acts as the main centre for Spanish publishing. Furthermore, the Catalan people’s passion for books is a celebrated tradition every year on April 23rd. This is the day dedicated to their patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and it also happens to be Shakespeare’s birthday. On this special day, people give each other books and roses as gifts, and the streets are filled with temporary book stands.

However, this year, the pandemic meant that the Sant Jordi celebrations were essentially cancelled. Lluís Morral, the manager of Laie, which is arguably the city’s most popular bookshop, believes that the event will likely be a much smaller affair in 2021. Morral has noticed a definite increase in book sales during the lockdown period, with classics proving more popular than the latest bestsellers. ""Many people have returned to reading, and they are not necessarily looking for the newest releases. Instead, they are catching up on books they always intended to read but never got around to,"" he explained. ""Many people buy books on Sant Jordi but then don't read them. Now, they're realising that they have all these unread books at home, and they've finally started reading them.""

He agrees with Sarrias that the isolation caused by the pandemic has led people to discover – or rediscover – the comforting presence of books. ""I can't speak for everyone, but in my circle of friends and acquaintances, many people got completely fed up with watching TV series,"" Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes that offer quiet spaces for reading, which is a much-needed escape in a city that is officially recognised as the noisiest in Europe. Two other new bookshops, Ona, which only sells books in Catalan, and Finestres, which is planned to open in the spring, are also designed to be places where people can meet and read, as well as purchase books. These two ventures have been financially supported by local benefactors. Morral wishes them well, but he also recognises that, like all independent bookshops, these relatively small businesses will face a real challenge competing with Amazon. ""What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personalized service and a genuine understanding of the books you've bought and what you might enjoy reading next. We can provide this instead of relying on an algorithm to tell you what to read,"" he concluded."
16,16_0,0,"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said.","The French government is facing criticism for seemingly giving in to those who are against vaccination, following reports that only a few hundred people were vaccinated in the days after the country’s vaccination program started. Health officials stated that France is approaching this situation as “a marathon, not a sprint,” explaining that they are proceeding cautiously, partly due to the significant public doubt surrounding the vaccine. A recent survey indicated that only about 40% of people in France are willing to get vaccinated. This number has decreased since October, when just over half of the French population expressed their willingness to be vaccinated. In comparison, willingness to receive the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US.

France began administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, prioritizing staff and residents in nursing homes, as well as individuals considered to be at high risk of developing serious symptoms from the virus. France stands out as the only country requiring individuals to provide written consent after being informed about potential side effects or reasons why they shouldn’t have the vaccine. However, less than one hundred people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, according to health ministry officials, only 332 people had been vaccinated. The ministry has announced that the goal is to vaccinate one million elderly and at-risk individuals in January, which would require over 31,200 vaccinations each day.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, acknowledged that France is vaccinating at a slower pace compared to other countries, suggesting that this was a deliberate strategy to allow for a thorough information campaign, rather than being due to a shortage of vaccines or problems with the distribution process. “We have the same amount of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same objectives, and we will achieve the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking some time to get started… I don’t believe speed is the same as rushing,” he added.

President Emmanuel Macron and other ministers have assured the public that the vaccine will not be mandatory, and officials have confirmed that no register will be created to keep track of those who refuse to get the Covid-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, Macron emphasized that people should be guided by ""reason and science"". ""The vaccine is not compulsory. Trust our scientists and doctors,” he said."

Philippe Juvin, head of the casualty ward at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. “As an individual, I would like to be vaccinated to set an example and show people that we don’t die from the vaccine, we die from Covid. And when we don’t die, we can get severe forms of it that are very disabling,” Juvin told CNews television. Opposition leaders said the slowness of the vaccination programme made France the “dunce” of Europe. Damien Abad, leader of the centre-right opposition Les Républicains in the Assemblée Nationale, demanded an urgent meeting with the health minister. In a letter, other opposition critics wrote: “Mass vaccination is the ultimate means of seeing our country emerge from the damaging economic situation caused by the health crisis.

Critics say this hesitation is feeding conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxer sentiment. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, said the scientific data was clear. “The vaccine is safe and efficient.

Philippe Juvin, who leads the emergency department at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, shared this opinion. “Personally, I would want to be vaccinated to demonstrate that the vaccine isn't deadly, but Covid is.

The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","Authorities in Gibraltar are conducting daily checks on the Barbary macaque population because they are concerned that these famous monkeys could be susceptible to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively fortunate during the pandemic, with around 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths reported.

Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer in charge of caring for Gibraltar’s macaque population, explained, “We knew it from the beginning. It’s logical. If you have a virus that affects primates like us, then there’s always going to be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year, the government tried to reduce contact with the macaques, which are one of the territory’s main tourist attractions. A new law, which was introduced in August, made it illegal to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing laws that already impose large fines for feeding them. In a statement announcing the new law, the government stated that ""Macaques are easily affected by human diseases. This has happened in the past when our macaques have, for example, caught hepatitis A.” It is believed that the monkeys have lived on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula. Local legend says that Gibraltar will remain under British rule as long as the macaques continue to live there. In the past, officials have taken extraordinary measures to protect the population. During the Second World War, Winston Churchill ordered that their decreasing numbers be increased by bringing in macaques from North Africa. Today, the population is around 220 macaques.

This supports the government's belief that the virus only poses a small risk to the macaques.

This was because of fears that new variations of the virus found in the animals could reduce the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines."
17,17_1,1,"The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal. They interact with themselves, they forage naturally, they spend more time grooming each other, there’s less aggression between the macaques,” said Pizarro. “So there is a lot of positive spin from decreased human contact.”","The government of Gibraltar expressed significant concern regarding the Danish announcement.

Up to now, they have observed few indications of infection.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”.

19,19_0,0,"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that it would be glad to meet the letter’s signatories to discuss reforms. “We know that as a sector we can and must do better,” said chief executive Kate Henderson.","Following an article in The Observer newspaper about a Black tenant made homeless due to a racist campaign by her neighbours, activists are urging social housing providers to prioritize the safety and well-being of their tenants over financial gain. A group of former leaders in social housing, including Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin, and Barry Simons, have collectively signed an open letter addressed to the National Housing Federation. This letter emphasizes a broader failure to adequately protect those who experience racial harassment.

The letter calls for a prompt review of social housing policies to guarantee that individuals responsible for racial harassment are evicted, or alternatively, that their victims are given priority when it comes to being rehoused. The group took action after learning about the difficult situation of Laura Tate (not her real name), who has been without a home for five years after she had to leave her apartment because of death threats. Despite the perpetrators being convicted of racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&Q), did not evict them and also failed to find Tate a new home. A judge recently awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&Q for negligence.

The Observer also reported on another case involving a Black tenant who has been living in a women’s refuge for two years after escaping an abusive former partner. L&Q had not rehoused her, demanding substantial proof that she was in danger. Lord Filkin, a Labour member of the House of Lords, stated, “These are not just isolated incidents. Board members and managers have a basic obligation to make sure their tenants can live peacefully in their homes; they need to do more to ensure they are meeting this obligation.”

L&Q, which provides housing for 250,000 people in over 105,000 properties throughout the south-east of England, has promised to conduct an independent review of its procedures for handling abuse cases after The Observer's investigation. In a statement published on its website, the organisation acknowledged that improvements could be made and reiterated its policy of zero tolerance towards all forms of discrimination.

The National Housing Federation, representing housing associations, stated that it would welcome a meeting with the signatories of the letter to discuss potential reforms. Chief executive Kate Henderson said, ""We recognise that as a sector, we can and must improve our performance."""
19,19_1,1,"“Last month we launched our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Insight report, which provided evidence of the change we need to deliver. “This, and our new code of governance, emphasise the importance of housing association boards and staff reflecting the diversity of the communities they serve and ensuring the sector is always working to strengthen relationships with residents.”","Last month, we released our Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Insight report. This report clearly showed the areas where change is needed within our organization. Both the report and our newly implemented code of governance highlight how crucial it is that housing association boards and their employees represent the diverse backgrounds of the communities they work in. Furthermore, they emphasize that the housing sector should consistently strive to improve its relationships with the people who live in the properties it manages."

Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him. No doubt the chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten – who was the last British governor of Hong Kong – will be sympathetic. There is also plenty of space for the erection of a memorial near the Chinese embassy in central London.

Considering that many of the numerous victims were students, it is fitting for universities in other countries to make sure their courage and sacrifice are not forgotten.

Student unions in the UK, especially those universities with a significant number of Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming buildings or parts of them. This is similar to what happened after the authorities murdered Steve Biko, the black South African anti-apartheid student activist. For example, the Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005, but the student union building at Manchester University (which is the largest in the UK) is still named after him.

Chris Patten, the Chancellor of Oxford University and the last British Governor of Hong Kong, will undoubtedly understand this situation. Furthermore, there is ample room to erect a memorial near the Chinese embassy in central London.

Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs.","On Wednesday, a group of anti-vaccine protesters, seemingly mistaken about the location, entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes.

22,22_0,0,"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","Mudassar Kadir, a former BBC journalist from Afghanistan who successfully escaped the Taliban, has been stuck in a refugee camp for several months. This is due to delays in a resettlement program that the UK government promised. Kadir is the only one out of fourteen former BBC employees who has managed to leave Afghanistan since the Taliban took control in August. The other thirteen remain hidden, living in constant fear for their safety.

Kadir, who also worked for the World Bank and the previous Afghan government, had hoped that he and his family could start a new life after leaving Afghanistan. However, since escaping in early October with the assistance of a US charity, Kadir, his wife, and their two young sons have been stranded in a refugee centre located on the edge of Dubai.

The Kadir family are thankful to the United Arab Emirates for providing them with a safe place. They are being well cared for, but they are not allowed to go further than 100 metres from the building. Furthermore, the UAE does not accept applications for asylum.

Kadir is extremely frustrated by the UK government's repeated refusals to help him. He remains afraid of being sent back to Afghanistan, where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. ""The UK has a responsibility to look after me and my family. My life is in danger because I worked for the BBC. The UK government is aware of this, but they have not done anything to assist me,"" he stated. ""At first, we were hopeful that the UK would grant me a visa, but now, with each day that passes, my frustration only increases.""

Activists say that the family's difficult situation highlights the problems faced by thousands of Afghan migrants who are trapped in a difficult situation. They are unable to return home because they fear being persecuted, and they are prevented from travelling to any country willing to grant them refugee status.

The UK government has promised an Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) to help up to 5,000 people each year, starting in January. This is in addition to the existing, more limited Afghanistan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has assisted fewer than 400 people so far. He is also unable to apply for ACRS because it hasn't started yet. When it does, it will only accept resettlement requests from non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Campaigners are worried that the UK government is deliberately delaying the start of the scheme in order to reduce the number of people they have to help."
22,22_1,1,"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office disagrees with this assessment. A representative stated, ""The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) is one of the most supportive programmes our country has ever offered, and it will provide a new life in the UK for up to 20,000 more people who are in danger."" The spokesperson continued, ""We are continuing to work quickly to launch the scheme, despite the situation being complicated and constantly changing. We are working across government and with partners such as the UNHCR to design the scheme effectively."" The Home Office will not discuss individual cases. When asked about the reason for the delay, they explained that they are developing a ""biometric enrolment"" system and conducting eligibility checks to ensure that anyone accepted into the scheme doesn't represent a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in similar situations, argues that time is quickly running out. Minnie Rahman, the organisation's interim chief executive, said, ""Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees, but it increasingly feels like there is very little welcome actually available. Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been disgracefully abandoned by the British government, even though they have clear connections to the UK. The resettlement scheme still isn’t open, the options for family reunions are still extremely restricted, and our government seems unable to offer refuge to many who risked their lives working with us, despite their desperate need for it."" The National Union of Journalists has been urging the government to help obtain visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one individual who survived an armed attack on a relative’s house in October. Michelle Stanistreet, the union's general secretary, said, ""While progress on the resettlement process is happening extremely slowly, the journalists affected are living in fear and are being forced to hide.

23,23_0,0,"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","As we approach a new year, the world is confronted with a significant number of difficult problems. These include the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the urgent climate crisis, the global competition between democratic and authoritarian systems, several serious humanitarian emergencies, large-scale migration, and terrorism that crosses national borders. There's also a danger of new conflicts between countries, made worse by the weakening of the established international system based on agreed rules, and the increasing use of deadly weapons that can operate independently. Overall, for the majority of people around the world – and even a few in space – 2022 is likely to be another year filled with uncertainty and risk.

Events in the Middle East are likely to be major news stories again in 2022, with both positive and negative developments. One reason for optimism is the Football World Cup, which starts in Qatar in November. This is the first time that an Arab or Muslim country has hosted this major sporting event. It is expected to significantly boost business and tourism in the Gulf region in the future, and perhaps even encourage more open and progressive forms of government.

However, the decision to choose Qatar as the host country was controversial from the beginning, especially due to allegations of corruption. Its human rights record will be examined more closely than ever. The way it treats low-paid migrant workers is another sensitive issue. The Guardian newspaper reported that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar was chosen by FIFA in 2010, while building seven new stadiums, roads, hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also remain about Qatar’s restrictive approach to freedom of speech, and the rights of women and LGBTQ+ individuals, in a country where openly criticizing the government is still dangerous and where homosexuality is illegal.

Nevertheless, some experts suggest that most football fans will not concentrate on these issues, which could make the Qatar 2022 World Cup the most successful example so far of ""sports-washing,"" where a country uses a sporting event to improve its image.

More familiar topics will otherwise dominate the regional news. A key question is whether Israel and/or the United States will take new military or economic actions to limit Iran’s efforts to develop the capability to build nuclear weapons, which Iran denies it is trying to do. Israel has threatened to launch air strikes if the slow-moving discussions to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement fail. Even football fans would find it hard to ignore a war in the Gulf."
23,23_1,1,"Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence.","In the coming year, much attention will be directed towards Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who is seen as an authoritarian leader. His neo-Islamist AKP party will celebrate 20 years in power in 2022. Over time, Erdoğan's leadership has become increasingly strict and controlling within Turkey. At the same time, his forceful foreign policy, disagreements with both the EU and the US, his inconsistent relationship with Russia regarding Syria, and his consistent poor handling of the economy could lead to unexpected problems.

Other areas of concern are likely to include Lebanon, which is close to becoming a failed state similar to war-stricken Yemen, and Libya, which remains in a state of constant turmoil. We should also closely monitor Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas, has delayed elections. The increasing violence from Israeli settlers, the ongoing seizure of land in the West Bank, and the absence of any real progress in the peace process are all major causes for worry.

In the Asia-Pacific region, China will be a major focus of global attention throughout the year. The Winter Olympics will begin in Beijing in February. However, the sporting competition and the question of which country wins the most medals may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts from the US, the UK, and other nations. These boycotts are a protest against China's repeated human rights violations. These countries are concerned that the Games might be used as a propaganda tool by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The CCP's 20th national congress, which is scheduled for the end of the year, will also attract significant attention. President Xi Jinping hopes to secure a third five-year term, something that has never been done before. If he succeeds, it would solidify his position as the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong. There will also be intense competition for high-ranking positions within the Politburo and its standing committee. However, things might not go completely as Xi hopes.

Western experts have different opinions about how secure Xi's position really is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an aging population, significant environmental and climate challenges, and efforts led by the US to limit China's influence by forming alliances with neighboring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Despite these challenges, it is likely that in 2022, China will continue its strong efforts to expand its economic and political influence around the world."
23,23_2,2,"A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister.","A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi Jinping has pledged to bring back under mainland control, even if it requires using force, could dramatically alter the global landscape. India, China's main rival in the region, may still not be as influential globally as it could be. Some estimates suggest that India's population could soon equal or even surpass China's 1.41 billion, which would be a moment of great symbolic significance. However, birth rates and average family sizes are decreasing in India. Of greater concern, and potentially more dangerous, are the unresolved border disagreements in the Himalayas between these two large nations. These disputes caused violent clashes in 2020-21, and they reflect a general worsening of relations between India and China. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, who has been accused of authoritarian tendencies, has recently declined due to the pandemic and a slow economy. He was forced to reverse his position on agricultural reforms after facing strong opposition, and he is accused of using anti-terrorism laws to silence those who criticize him. His BJP party will attempt to regain support in a number of state elections in 2022. Modi's policy of strengthening ties with Western countries, as demonstrated by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, and Australia), will likely be reinforced, further troubling China. In other parts of Asia, the violent suppression of protests in Myanmar and the extremely difficult situation faced by the Afghan people following the Taliban's return to power will probably lead to expressions of concern from Western countries rather than substantial action. Afghanistan is on the verge of collapse. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley from the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea's risky nuclear actions could lead to a confrontation, as Kim Jong-un's suspicious government sends conflicting messages about its intentions regarding war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the current president, Rodrigo Duterte, who is known for his offensive language, is only allowed to serve one term. Sadly, the same restriction doesn't apply to Scott Morrison, who will be seeking re-election as Australia's prime minister."
23,23_3,3,"Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine.","Europe faces a year of significant challenges as EU leaders and national governments struggle with intense disagreements both within the bloc and in its relationships with other countries. They will also need to address the continuing social and economic consequences of the pandemic, manage migration issues, and deal with the increased demands linked to achieving net-zero emissions goals following the COP26 climate conference.

More importantly, Europe needs to decide whether it wants to be a respected player on the global stage, or if it will allow its international influence to be taken over by countries like China and the US, as well as by problematic regimes like Vladimir Putin's Russia.

The elections in France and Hungary in the spring could set the tone for the year. In both countries, right-wing populist groups are once again promoting ideas that cause division. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán, the leader who has been criticized for his authoritarian style and for disregarding EU rules on the rule of law, democracy, and freedom of speech, will face a united opposition for the first time. The outcome of this election will be carefully observed in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and other EU countries where far-right parties are gaining popularity.

In France, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist politician who unexpectedly won the election in 2017, will be asking voters for a second term. He will be competing against Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour, whose political views have been described as racist and anti-Islamic. Opinion polls suggest Macron is currently in the lead, but he may also face a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the party. With the left wing weakened, the election could potentially push France towards more conservative and reactionary policies.

Elections are also planned in Sweden, Serbia, and Austria. In Germany, the new coalition government led by the SPD will be closely watched as it tries to implement new policies after Angela Merkel's long period in power. Despite some promises of cooperation, disagreements are likely to arise with the European Commission, headed by Ursula von der Leyen, a close ally of Merkel, and with France and other southern EU countries regarding budget plans and debt management.

France will take over the EU presidency in January, and Macron intends to promote his ideas for a common European defence and security policy – something he refers to as ""strategic autonomy."" Macron's belief that Europe needs to be self-reliant in a challenging world will be tested on various issues, most notably in relation to Ukraine."
23,23_4,4,"Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world.","Experts are warning that increased military pressure from Russia, including a significant build-up of troops along its border and a threat to station nuclear missiles, could spark a new conflict early in the year, particularly as NATO seems hesitant to intervene. Other factors that could ignite conflict include Belarus using migrants as a political weapon (and the ongoing lack of a unified and compassionate migration policy across Europe), as well as growing separatist tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the wider Balkan region. The European Union is planning a summit with China, but there is disagreement on how to balance trade interests with concerns about human rights. In Britain, which is feeling increasingly isolated and struggling economically, regret over leaving the EU is likely to become more widespread. Relations with the United States, which is critical of Europe trying to act independently but seems uncertain about how to deal with the situation in Ukraine, could be strained at times. NATO, with its reputation damaged after the events in Afghanistan, faces a challenging year as it searches for a new Secretary-General. Many believe that a woman could be appointed to this position for the first time. Theresa May, the former Prime Minister of the UK, has been mentioned as a possibility, but France would likely oppose a British candidate. In Latin America, the upcoming national elections in Brazil in October, where efforts are being made to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, the controversial right-wing president, are expected to be fiercely contested and have significant international consequences. Within Brazil, Bolsonaro has faced widespread criticism for his disastrous handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, a number only surpassed by the United States. On a global scale, Bolsonaro is heavily criticized for denying climate change and for accelerating the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls suggest that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was previously imprisoned and later cleared of corruption charges, would easily defeat Bolsonaro if he were to run. However, this assumes that the elections will be conducted fairly. There is increasing worry that supporters of Donald Trump in the United States are advising Bolsonaro's team on how to rig the election or stage a coup to overturn the results, similar to Trump's unsuccessful attempt in Washington a year ago. Concerns are growing that Trump's tactics of undermining elections may be copied by others around the world."
23,23_5,5,"Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision.","While surveys in Europe indicate that support for right-wing populist and nationalist politicians might be decreasing, this trend might not hold true in South America (excluding Brazil) and other areas of the developing world in 2022. Populism thrives on the difference between corrupt “elites” and what are called “ordinary people.” In many less wealthy countries, this difference, when we look at wealth and power, is actually getting bigger. In countries like Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who were supposedly fighting for the people have instead become their oppressors, and this pattern seems likely to continue. In Chile, the first round of the presidential election showed significant support for José Antonio Kast, a far-right supporter of Pinochet. However, he was eventually defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader. Boric will become the country’s youngest leader after winning a decisive victory in the second round. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, is facing a different set of challenges in what appears to be a difficult year. His Peronist party, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost its majority in Congress for the first time in almost 40 years after recent elections. The president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will continue to experience tensions with the US regarding trade, drug issues, and migration from Central America. However, at least he no longer has to deal with Trump’s insults – for now. In North America, everyone will be watching the campaigns for the November mid-term elections. The Democrats will try to prevent the Republicans from regaining control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will undoubtedly be seen as a judgement on Joe Biden’s performance as president. If the Republican Party performs well in the key states, Donald Trump – who still falsely insists he won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for president again in 2024. Certain issues will be important throughout the country. These include the progress (or lack of progress) in controlling the pandemic and the continuing resistance to vaccinations, the economy with rising prices and interest rates expected, and divisive social issues like migration, race, and abortion rights. It's predicted that the Supreme Court may overturn or significantly weaken parts of the important 1973 Roe v Wade decision."
23,23_6,6,"The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September.","One of the biggest challenges for the Democratic Party in 2022 could be disagreements within the party itself. The division between what are called progressives and moderates, particularly in the Senate, weakened President Biden's main proposals for spending on social programs and infrastructure. These bills were made less ambitious as a result.

Attention will also be focused on President Biden himself, considering whether he'll decide to run again in 2024. Questions are being raised about his age – he will be 80 in November – as well as his mental sharpness and his ability to achieve his goals. His approval rating, which was -7 in mid-December, might be difficult to improve.

Vice President Kamala Harris is also being carefully watched. There are reports that she is feeling insecure and not performing as well as expected, at least according to sources who may want to create problems for the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the Secretary of Transportation who ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020, is another person to keep an eye on. He could potentially replace Harris, or even Biden, if the president decides to only serve one term.

In the meantime, there's increasing worry about whether the midterm elections will be conducted fairly, considering the significant efforts by Republican state politicians to make voting more difficult. They are also making it harder for their opponents to win by creating congressional districts that heavily favour the Republican Party. One study estimates that Republicans will gain at least five seats in the House of Representatives because of these unfairly redrawn voting maps. This could be enough to guarantee a Republican majority in the House even before the elections take place.

The ongoing issue of Central American migrants arriving at the US southern border will likely remain a major topic in 2022. This is a problem that Vice President Harris was assigned to handle, but so far she has not managed it successfully. Both she and President Biden are being criticised for continuing the strict policies of the previous Trump administration.

Confidence in President Biden's abilities has also been damaged by the chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, which many felt was a humiliating defeat similar to the Vietnam War. Another major foreign policy problem or international crisis – such as a Russian invasion of Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan, or a conflict between Israel and Iran – could potentially involve US forces and seriously harm President Biden's presidency.

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to introduce new policies related to affordable childcare and housing, following his re-election in September."
23,23_7,7,"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","However, in the unexpected election of 2021, Justin Trudeau's Liberal party received the lowest percentage of the overall vote of any winning party in Canadian history. This indicates that his popularity may be declining. There are ongoing disagreements about supposed corruption, the handling of the pandemic, trade relationships with the United States, and policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions.

As you would expect from such a large continent, some of the most important global issues of 2022 will be particularly relevant in Africa. One of the most important of these is the difficult question of whether Africans, who are still mostly unvaccinated, will suffer significantly due to the wealthier countries' control of vaccines. This includes the reluctance of richer nations to distribute surplus vaccines, share patents, and deal with the numerous health and economic consequences of the pandemic.

This situation then leads to another question: will this self-centered behavior negatively affect wealthier nations in the long run, as former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The rapid spread of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, suggests that further COVID-19 variants could emerge in 2022. Nevertheless, developed countries might again respond by prioritizing domestic protection over international collaboration.

The future course of the global pandemic in 2022, considering both the health risks and economic impact, is ultimately impossible to predict with certainty. However, in many African countries, where relatively young populations are less likely to suffer severe harm from COVID-19, the larger problem may be the negative impact on the treatment of other diseases. It is estimated that 25 million people in Africa will be living with HIV/AIDS in 2022. Malaria causes almost 400,000 deaths each year. Treatment for these diseases, as well as others like tuberculosis and diabetes, could worsen as a result of the strain that the pandemic has put on healthcare systems.

According to many experts, Africa has become the new main area for international terrorism, replacing the Middle East in that regard. This trend is likely to continue in 2022. Specifically, the countries in the Sahel region have experienced an increase in radical Islamist groups. These groups are mainly local, but often declare their loyalty to global networks such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State. Efforts by Western nations to combat this rise in jihadist violence may become more coordinated in 2022."
23,23_8,8,"This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought.","This situation arises from a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron. Macron had previously ended French military operations in Mali due to insufficient support. Western governments are increasingly worried about the expansion of radical Islamist ideologies from key West African nations, such as Nigeria, into the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique, a country rich in energy resources. Somalia, a country that has largely failed as a state and where the al-Shabaab group is active, serves as a warning example of what can happen when terrorism is not controlled.

In a year when the US is planning to host a second ""summit for democracy,"" the matter of global democratic governance, and specifically the absence of it, will be a major concern. This issue is particularly urgent in Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan. Closely connected to this is the problem of extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries most likely to face worsening humanitarian crises are located in Africa. These countries are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The non-African countries considered most vulnerable are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.)

In the Horn of Africa, the combination of problems in Ethiopia, described by the IRC as a “perfect storm,” is being made worse by a growing civil war. This conflict threatens to break up the country, further complicated by increased interference from neighbouring Eritrea's violently authoritarian government. At the same time, the UN is warning that a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April.

UNICEF, the UN children’s organisation, has launched a record $9.4 billion global funding appeal for 2022. This aims to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, who are affected by humanitarian crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. These emergency situations provide the backdrop for another significant challenge in 2022: international migration. This includes refugees fleeing conflict, asylum seekers facing political persecution, and economic migrants forced to leave their homes due to climate change, famine, and drought."
23,23_9,9,"The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars.","According to the International Organisation for Migration, a part of the UN, a record 281 million people, representing 3.6% of the world's population, were considered international migrants in 2020. This number is still increasing, even though there were restrictions on international travel due to the pandemic. These significant shifts in population have not yet resulted in a well-organised, or even logical, reaction from most governments, especially in richer countries in North America and Europe. Perhaps this will change in 2022. However, it’s probably best not to expect too much too soon.

Moving on from Antarctica and the Arctic… and beyond, the Cop27 conference, which follows on from the Cop26 climate crisis conference in Glasgow, will take place in Egypt in November. It will present progress reports on the promises made in Glasgow to reduce carbon and methane emissions, stop deforestation, gradually decrease coal production, reduce subsidies for fossil fuels, and provide financial help to lessen the damage suffered by poorer nations. It's unrealistic to anticipate any rapid improvement in the global situation regarding climate change in the coming year. We are almost certain to see extreme weather events like those experienced around the world in 2021 – such as fires, droughts, floods, storms, and record-breaking temperatures – repeated. As before, these effects will be felt particularly strongly in the world’s more fragile environments, especially the Antarctic and Arctic regions. Both polar regions are expected to see more human activity in 2022, which isn’t necessarily good news. In Antarctica, for instance, tourism is booming with the introduction of ice runways that can handle large passenger planes. Even more concerning is the increasing interest of China, along with other countries, in exploiting Antarctica's resources and establishing military bases there. Similarly, the melting ice in the Arctic has created new shipping routes for commercial and naval use across the northernmost part of the world. Russia is currently developing these routes in strong competition with several other nations. Greenland, which has been largely ignored for a long time, is becoming a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and is also attracting growing interest from defence planners, although local communities are increasingly resisting the granting of licences.

It will also be a busy year for space exploration and military competition. NASA is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it prepares to resume manned missions to the moon. A new space station called Gateway is being planned. Russia, South Korea, India, and Japan will all be launching spacecraft to the moon. The European Space Agency is planning to send a mission to Mars."
23,23_10,10,"China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind.","China is reportedly aiming to have a fully operational space station orbiting the Earth before the year is out. At the same time, space tourism, organized by Russia and private businesses like Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, is really beginning to gain momentum. However, on a more concerning note, the development of nuclear weapons designed for use in space also looks set to speed up. The United States, Russia, and China are all testing out new types of weaponry, including hypersonic vehicles that can orbit the Earth and are capable of launching nuclear missiles from any point in space. Russia sparked international outrage in late 2021 when it carelessly tested an anti-satellite missile. It's likely that other nations will copy this, potentially putting global communication systems at risk. Not wanting to be left behind, NASA has plans to deflect a large asteroid in September by deliberately crashing a spacecraft into it. This spacecraft was launched using a rocket developed by Elon Musk's company, SpaceX. The US refers to this as ""planetary defense,"" but the technology clearly has the potential to be used offensively as well. Some will see all of this as progress, while others will view it as a significant setback for humanity."
24,24_0,0,"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails.","A Guardian survey focusing on experts who have been working on the pandemic has revealed the shockingly widespread abuse, intimidation, and threatening behaviour directed at scientific and medical advisors to the UK government.

Dozens of these UK advisors have described experiences that range from organised online attacks to death threats and intimidation tactics. These tactics included having photos taken of their homes and shared online, as well as receiving suspicious packages in the mail, some containing items with handwritten messages.

Furthermore, the advisors have faced harassment in the form of extremely bitter tweets, emails, and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints lodged with their employers, reports to the General Medical Council regulatory body, offensive notes left on their cars, and insults shouted through their letterboxes. The police have filed charges in a few cases where individuals connected to specific threats were identified.

The advisors weren’t the only ones targeted. The abuse also affected their students, colleagues, and family members, including their partners and children. One advisor, who also works as a family doctor, reported that the surgery's receptionists had to deal with extremely unpleasant and angry outbursts from callers because of the advisor's role. In another instance, an advisor's child was repeatedly singled out by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government's lockdown policy. The family chose not to make an official complaint because the child's exam grade depended on the teacher's evaluation.

The Guardian survey was sent to over 100 scientists, doctors, and other researchers who contribute to the advice that ministers receive through groups like the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups like the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been kept anonymous.

Three-quarters of the 42 people who responded said they had experienced significant abuse related to government policy, their opinions on scientific matters, or the results of their research. This often happened after they were quoted in the media or spoke at public events, such as parliamentary inquiries or online seminars organized by groups like the UK's various royal societies.

In an article published in the Guardian today, Professor John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, stated that he and his junior staff regularly receive abusive emails."
24,24_1,1,"“If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers.","He explains that mentioning vaccination in the media, particularly when it concerns children, often leads to a strong reaction. However, he points out that this typically only happens if those comments are highlighted by right-wing newspapers, especially the Daily Mail. One of the advisors who participated in the survey received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police. This advisor also faced a massive amount of hateful messages every time they appeared in the media. A doctor commented that much of this abuse is sexist and extremely unpleasant. ""I've never experienced anything like this before,"" the doctor said. ""I'm just trying to do my best to prevent people from dying.""

A lot of this activity comes from individuals who feel more threatened by the government's response to the pandemic than by the pandemic itself, even though the advisors are not involved in making policy decisions. Many advisors report that the abuse intensifies whenever they speak publicly about topics like masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, short, sharp lockdowns, or wider lockdowns. This means that the abuse is becoming more frequent as the Omicron variant spreads.

Early in the pandemic, a significant increase in threatening behaviour led government security specialists to advise the experts on how to protect themselves better. This included improving their computer security and enhancing their personal safety by changing the times and routes they used to travel to work, and by checking under their cars before driving. Some advisors have had security assessments of their homes and workplaces, and have had alarms and round-the-clock surveillance cameras installed, connected to the local police station. Several universities have employed private security companies to help the experts work safely and to ensure that campaigners and protesters don't interfere with their work. Government cybersecurity experts have managed to remove some sensitive information that was posted online, but they haven't always been successful.

Many advisors reported a constant flow of hate messages via Twitter and email. These messages included statements like ""I hope your family die,"" ""I hope horrible people like you are held accountable,"" ""you will pay for killing our children with vaccines,"" and ""go back to where you came from."" Some respondents mentioned that the mainstream media sometimes made the situation worse by focusing on the most negative possible outcomes, or by giving legitimacy to abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on the advisors."
24,24_2,2,"The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”","The research didn't provide solid proof that women suffered more mistreatment than men, although some women seemed less comfortable talking about what they had gone through. Several male colleagues expressed concern about the severity and type of abuse aimed at women they knew. One stated, “There appears to be a significant difference between the genders, with women being targeted far more often than men."" Despite the large amount of abuse, several advisors pointed out that they also received compliments, appreciation, and backing from the public, which balanced out the harsh criticism. “It's made me more resilient to a lot of the negativity,"" one said. George Freeman, the science minister, described the abuse as ""shocking"". He stated, ""All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to speak out against this... Scientists and doctors should not be blamed for decisions made honestly by ministers who are accountable to Parliament.""

While many advisors commended the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for establishing ""comprehensive support systems"", some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before agreeing to participate. This intense focus has led some scientists to avoid attention, decline interviews, and consider withdrawing from public debate. However, most indicated that the abuse had little effect or even made them more determined. “If anything, it encouraged me to get more involved,” one advisor said.

25,25_0,0,"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban].","Ashraf Ghani, the former president of Afghanistan, has spoken publicly for the first time since leaving Kabul four months ago. In his interview, he essentially blamed the international community, particularly the United States, for the collapse of the Afghan republic. Ghani told the BBC that he was quickly forced to leave Kabul in a helicopter by his ""terrified"" national security advisor, Hamdullah Mohib, and the head of the rapidly failing presidential security team. Ghani explained that they told him that the presidential protection service had fallen apart, and that if he resisted, all of them would be killed. According to Ghani, Mohib gave him no more than two minutes to decide. He was speaking to General Sir Nick Carter, the former head of the British defence staff, who was in charge of the BBC Radio 4's Today programme as a guest editor. Even before Ghani fled into exile, it was evident that the Taliban were likely to take control of Afghanistan. However, his hurried departure destroyed any possibility of a peaceful transfer of power, which might have allowed some international aid to continue, and ruined plans for a government that included different groups. Currently, Afghanistan is threatened by widespread hunger. Its economy has shrunk by over a third, and its healthcare and education systems have been severely damaged due to the sudden stop in foreign funding that they depended on. When Carter asked Ghani what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom ""blame you as their leader"" for the current disastrous situation, Ghani said that his biggest mistake was trusting Afghanistan's allies. He stated that the Afghan people are justified in blaming him for this. He explained that he put his faith in the international partnership and followed that path. He added that they all made a major error in assuming that the international community would remain patient for a long time. Ghani criticized Washington for excluding his government from years of peace talks with the Taliban. He claimed that agreements signed under Zalmay Khalilzad, the US peace envoy, effectively sacrificed Afghans to ensure a trouble-free withdrawal of US troops. He argued that the responsibility for the process and the outcome clearly lies with the American team. Ghani insisted that they were never given the chance to negotiate directly with the Taliban."
25,25_1,1,"Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue. They erased us.” Khalilzad said in his own interview with the Today programme that the collapse of the republic was due to a “failure of Afghan leadership” and Afghan troops that did not “resist hard” against the Taliban. Six months ago the two men were among the most influential figures shaping Afghanistan’s future; now neither are willing to accept any responsibility for the tragedy stalking the country. Carter asked the former president about any personal regrets that had surfaced in the last 100 days. Ghani did not mention the humanitarian crisis, but he lamented the damage to his reputation and legacy. “My work has been destroyed. My values have been trampled on, and I’ve been made a scapegoat.”","Ambassador Khalilzad engaged in discussions with them, which shifted the focus, turning it into a matter of American concern rather than solely an Afghan one. In their view, ""they completely ignored our presence."" Khalilzad, in an interview he gave to the Today programme, stated that the downfall of the Afghan government was the result of ""Afghan leaders failing"" and the Afghan army not ""putting up a strong enough fight"" against the Taliban. Only half a year ago, these two men were key players in determining Afghanistan's future; however, now neither seems prepared to acknowledge any responsibility for the devastating situation the country is facing. Carter questioned the former president about any personal regrets he might have developed over the past three months. Ghani made no mention of the humanitarian disaster, but he did express sorrow over the damage to his reputation and the legacy he would leave behind. ""My efforts have been undone. My principles have been disregarded, and I've been unfairly blamed for everything."""
26,26_0,0,"Thousands of South Africans will pause to remember the anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90, every day this week as bells are rung at churches across the country for 10 minutes at noon. Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country.","Throughout this week, thousands of South Africans will take a moment to remember Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the famous anti-apartheid figure who passed away on Sunday at the age of 90.

Former US President Barack Obama said in a statement: ""Archbishop Tutu possessed a universal spirit. He was deeply involved in the fight for freedom and fairness in his own nation, but he was also worried about injustice wherever it existed."" The body of the Nobel Prize winner will be available for public viewing for two days before his funeral, which will take place on January 1st at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town, where he used to preach. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes will eventually be buried, will ring for 10 minutes every day at midday until Friday as a mark of respect. Numerous memorial services are planned across South Africa in the coming days, and flags will be lowered to half-mast. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba said on Monday: ""Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral, as well as at many other cathedrals and churches across the country. In Cape Town, people will also recite the Angelus prayer.” In a nation still facing significant challenges due to widespread inequality, divided political opinions, and the lasting impact of the oppressive apartheid system, the death of such an important figure in the fight for freedom has created a rare feeling of togetherness. Since the news of Tutu’s death was announced, people from all walks of life have been visiting St George’s Cathedral, with many leaving flowers beneath a portrait of the clergyman that has been placed on a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or writing in a book of condolences. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who explained that the Nobel laureate ""was a hero to us; he fought for us."" She added: ""We are free because of him. Without him, we might have lost our way as a country."""
26,26_1,1,"He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo. Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party.","""He was simply a good man,"" said Mokwadi, holding her granddaughter's hand tightly. ""His importance goes beyond just being an Anglican figure,"" explained Brent Goliath, a mourner, as he began to cry outside the old stone church. He mentioned that he had been an altar boy and had the opportunity to meet Tutu on several occasions. ""I felt very emotional this morning when I heard about his death. I'm grateful that he was there for us,"" he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bunch of pink flowers under Tutu's photograph. Daphney Ramakgopa, a 58-year-old local government employee, talked about the sense of loss felt by the entire country. ""We admired him as someone who advised everyone in the country, especially our politicians,"" she said. To honour Tutu, South Africa's cricket team wore black armbands on the first day of their Test match against India in South Africa. In Cape Town, Table Mountain was illuminated in purple as a tribute to him. South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, described him as a man of ""remarkable intelligence, honesty, and resilience against the system of apartheid."" Ramaphosa stated that Tutu's death marked ""another stage of mourning as our nation says goodbye to a generation of exceptional South Africans who have left us a free South Africa,"" following the death of FW de Klerk, the country’s last president during the apartheid era, in November. ""Fighting for freedom from within South Africa required a kind of bravery that's hard to put into words,"" said Graça Machel, Nelson Mandela's widow. Although Tutu had mostly withdrawn from public life in recent years, he continued his lifelong dedication to causes he believed in, strongly advocating for LGBT rights, equal opportunities in education, and the right to assisted dying. The charismatic clergyman, whose contagious laughter and relaxed manner hid a strong dedication to his values, had also been very critical of South Africa's governing African National Congress party."
26,26_2,2,"Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer.","Due to the Covid regulations currently in place in South Africa, the number of people allowed to attend the funeral will be limited to a maximum of 100, according to church officials. They explained that ""only a small proportion of those who wish to be there will be able to fit into the cathedral."" The service will be an Anglican Requiem Mass, ""just as Archbishop Emeritus Desmond wanted,"" and will be conducted by Michael Nuttall, the former Bishop of Natal. Nuttall was known as ""number 2 to Tutu."" During the 1980s, Nuttall and Tutu had a strong relationship that ""showed how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,"" Anglican church representatives told journalists.

Tutu was born on October 7, 1931, in the small town of Klerksdorp, which is located west of Johannesburg. His career in the church began after he resigned from a highly desirable teaching position in 1958. He did this to protest against South Africa's discriminatory laws, a decade after the National Party won the elections and introduced the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions just to experience being addressed as ""Sir"" by white police officers, Tutu quickly moved up the ranks within the church.

By the late 1970s, Tutu had become one of the most internationally recognised leaders of the struggle for freedom. He played a significant part in making Western leaders face the moral implications of Cold War strategies, which had resulted in indirect support for the white-minority government in South Africa.

In 1984, Tutu’s dedication to non-violent resistance earned him the Nobel Peace Prize, and he was appointed Archbishop of Cape Town soon afterwards. When Nelson Mandela became president after South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994, Tutu created the phrase ""Rainbow Nation"" to describe his country. He then led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which exposed the terrible acts committed during the apartheid era.

However, Tutu also criticised the new government, including his close friend Mandela, for the high salaries paid to cabinet ministers. He strongly condemned President Jacob Zuma's administration, which ended in 2018 amidst accusations of widespread corruption. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and underwent repeated treatment. Consequently, he made fewer public appearances in his later years."

27,27_0,0,"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","The year has been devastating for human rights in Russia, and while it began with the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the forced closure of International Memorial is particularly striking due to its harshness. Established in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other activists who disagreed with the Soviet regime, the organisation took advantage of the new freedoms offered by Mikhail Gorbachev to uncover painful truths about the fate of millions of people who suffered under Stalin's oppressive rule. Memorial represented a powerful symbol of Russia’s newfound openness, but for many Russians, its significance was deeply personal: they were finally able to discover the tragic stories of their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cover-ups. Now, Memorial's closure represents another powerful symbol – the rapid destruction of Russian civil society. The organisation's leaders had hoped that public support, including backing from well-known figures like Gorbachev, would prevent the Kremlin from taking such action. They also believed that shutting down an organisation dedicated to revealing Soviet-era atrocities would be a step too extreme, even for Vladimir Putin. However, on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a judge proved them wrong. “When Russia decided to take a democratic, legal route forward, I never imagined that things would eventually start going backwards,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped create Memorial, told the Guardian newspaper last month. “Perhaps I was naive back then.” It’s easy to understand why Putin, deeply involved in historical disagreements over Crimea, the expansion of NATO, the fall of the Soviet Union, the Second World War, and other issues, views investigations into Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is much more concerned with perceived historical wrongs committed against Russia than with the uncomfortable truths that Memorial uncovered during its three decades of research in Russian archives. “Our country needs to have an honest and careful understanding of the Soviet past; this is essential for its future,” the organisation stated after its forced closure."
27,27_1,1,"In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","Instead of Memorial, which expressed its views forcefully and clearly about widespread acts of cruelty, the government is establishing a more controlled and carefully crafted account of the deaths of millions of people. This account focuses on condemning the deaths themselves, rather than the acts of murder that caused them. It identifies the people who died, but not those who were responsible for their deaths. The Russian government wants to present the closing down of Memorial as just a routine, administrative application of its laws regarding ""foreign agents."" However, on Tuesday, a prosecutor revealed the true political reason in court. In a passionate speech, they claimed that Memorial was ""dishonestly depicting the USSR as a terrorist state."" The prosecutor asked, ""Why should we, the descendants of those who won the war, have to witness the justification of those who betrayed their country and the collaborators with the Nazis?"" A lawyer representing Memorial stated that this situation reminded him of the staged trials of the 1930s. The leaders of Memorial have said that it is pointless to try and figure out which of the government's unspoken limits they crossed that led the authorities to shut them down. Some people think it is related to their work on preserving archives and historical records about Soviet terror. Others believe it is due to their support for political prisoners, such as Navalny. But the reality is that Memorial has been doing the same work it has always done since its beginning. It is Russia that has changed, possibly ending a short period when it was willing to allow an independent assessment of its history. Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch, said, ""It shows how afraid the government is that it is no longer prepared to accept the honest evaluation of its actions that Memorial provides. If that reflection is too horrible to face, the solution is to change the actions, not to break the mirror."""
28,28_0,0,"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","In Spain, several local governments have become some of the first in Western Europe to introduce menstrual leave for their staff. This is a step towards achieving a better balance between the demands of work and the discomfort caused by period pain.

Earlier this year, the city of Girona in Catalonia took the lead in Spain by considering flexible working options for any employee experiencing period-related pain. In June, they announced an agreement with their workforce of over 1,300 people, allowing women, trans men, and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours of menstrual leave per month. However, this time off must be made up within three months. ""Girona is famous for many things, and I believe we are now adding something new to that list by being pioneers in approving menstrual leave,"" said Maria Àngels Planas, the city's deputy mayor, at the time. ""We are breaking down the taboo that surrounds menstruation and the pain that some women – that we – experience during their periods.""

Soon after, the Catalan towns of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September, the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana stated that they had signed an agreement with their 1,500 employees which included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s, following requests from various staff members.

Menstrual leave policies have been legal in many parts of Asia for a long time. This is often based on concerns that workplace pressures could negatively affect women's ability to have children. In 2016, The Guardian interviewed several women in Japan and China who expressed hesitation about using this entitlement. They feared it would upset their male colleagues or harm their career prospects.

In the same year, Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, announced that they would be one of the first workplaces in the West to adopt menstrual leave. Their aim was to get rid of an office culture where employees had to choose between working while dealing with severe period symptoms, or using sick leave or holiday time. This decision sparked global debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the policy. Despite the discussion, managers at Coexist reported increased employee commitment and productivity. Research also indicated that around 14% of women had taken time off work or school because of their periods. It was in this context that the local workers' union in Girona initially suggested the idea."
28,28_1,1,"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","“There was significant disagreement about this,” explained Sílvia Rubio from the Intersindical-CSC union. Initially, union representatives considered requesting as much as two days of leave each month. However, this idea was dropped due to worries that it could make employers less willing to employ women or promote them into management positions. “To prevent any kind of discrimination based on gender, we ensured that any hours taken off would be compensated for at a later time,” Rubio clarified.

Negotiations with the city council presented another challenge, ultimately forcing them to reduce their initial request of 16 hours per month down to eight hours. Surprisingly, many of them found that gaining support for the policy was also difficult among some of their own colleagues. “There was a great deal of friction,” she said. “We had women who asked: ‘My husband suffers from migraines, so why can’t he take this kind of leave?’” Other women feared that the policy would create a stigma around women or portray menstruation as something that is always a painful experience.

Rubio responded by highlighting the broader implications. “We believe it's a wonderful achievement that we've accomplished this. This is a global issue for women; there's a lot of shame and discomfort surrounding it, and it's something that is largely ignored. We succeeded in addressing it,"" she stated. ""However, we don't want our efforts to stop here.” Instead, she viewed the policy as an initial step towards developing a workplace culture that allows for greater flexibility in addressing various needs, from chronic health conditions to caring responsibilities. ""Ultimately, this is all part of a process to improve workplaces for both women and men, and this applies to both the public and private sectors."""
29,29_0,0,"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has recorded a record number of new coronavirus infections, both nationally and across Europe, as the Omicron variant causes a sharp increase in cases throughout the continent, with several countries reporting their highest figures ever. On Wednesday, France announced 208,000 new cases in the previous 24 hours, a rise from the previous record of almost 180,000 set just the day before. The health minister, Olivier Véran, stated, ""This means that every second, 24 hours a day, in our country, two French people are testing positive for the coronavirus."" He added, ""We have never seen anything like this,"" describing the increase as ""staggering."" He explained that the situation in French hospitals was already concerning due to the Delta variant. Although the ""significant wave"" of Omicron cases hadn't yet significantly affected the healthcare system, he believed that it inevitably would in time.

The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Greece have all reported record numbers of new cases this week. Outside of Europe, the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US reached a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron responsible for 59% of those cases. New infections in Australia increased to almost 18,300 on Wednesday, surpassing the previous high of approximately 11,300 the day before. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed to “change its approach” significantly.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the simultaneous spread of the Delta and Omicron variants is creating a worrying surge in infections that could lead to more people needing hospital treatment and, sadly, more deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was ""very worried that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is causing a huge increase in cases, like a tsunami."" The WHO has warned that Omicron poses a ""very high"" risk and could overwhelm healthcare systems.

Studies in Britain, South Africa, and Denmark suggest that Omicron is less deadly than some previous versions of the virus. However, the sheer number of people testing positive means that hospitals in some countries could soon be under extreme pressure, and businesses may struggle to function as workers are required to isolate themselves. The rapid rate at which the new variant is spreading is forcing governments to carefully consider how to reintroduce restrictions to protect hospitals while also keeping economies and everyday life functioning."
29,29_1,1,"Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10, even as the number of new infections hit record highs, after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”.","Despite a surge in new COVID-19 infections reaching unprecedented levels, Spain has shortened its self-isolation period from ten to seven days. This decision comes after businesses voiced concerns that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant could lead to significant staff shortages.

Similarly, in Italy, the government decided on Wednesday evening to remove the requirement to self-isolate for individuals who have received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and have been in contact with someone who tested positive. The Italian government also reinforced restrictions for unvaccinated individuals. From January 10th, a health pass, proving vaccination or recovery from COVID-19, will be mandatory for travel on buses, subways, trains, and domestic flights. However, a proposal to introduce stricter rules for unvaccinated workers was not approved. On Wednesday, authorities reported another record daily increase of 98,030 cases.

In France, Members of Parliament began discussing a new law on Wednesday that would permit only vaccinated individuals to enter establishments such as bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports stadiums, and other public venues. A negative COVID-19 test would no longer be sufficient for entry.

Italy is among several nations that have cancelled or limited public gatherings due to the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also prohibited Christmas and New Year's celebrations in public spaces, introduced new restrictions on the hospitality industry on Wednesday. These measures, initially planned for early January, were implemented sooner following a new daily record of 21,657 cases, which is more than double the figure reported on Monday. Bars, nightclubs, and restaurants will now have to close at midnight, prohibiting standing customers and music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they are allowed to remain open until 2 a.m. The Health Minister, Thanos Plevris, stated that ""If these measures are fully implemented, they will allow us to return to our normal lives from mid-January.""

While some countries are bracing themselves for the peak of the Omicron wave, others are still waiting. In Germany, although case numbers are currently decreasing, the Health Minister, Karl Lauterbach, suggested that the actual number of infections could be considerably higher due to reduced testing during the holiday period. He estimated that the real incidence rate was ""two or three times as high"" as the officially reported rate of 205 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, which is the lowest it has been since November. He also predicted a sharp increase in cases ""within a very short period of time."""
29,29_2,2,"On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors. It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events. Lauterbach said the rules may have to be toughened further, as existing measures “will not be enough to prevent a significant rise in Omicron cases”. In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated.","On Tuesday, Germany shut down nightclubs and instructed organisers of sporting events to ensure they take place without spectators. Furthermore, private gatherings were limited to a maximum of 10 people who have been vaccinated, or to just two households if someone unvaccinated is present. These new regulations were introduced in addition to the restrictions already affecting unvaccinated individuals, who are prohibited from entering shops, restaurants, and attending cultural events. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach suggested that the rules might need to be strengthened even more, stating that the current measures ""will not be sufficient to stop a considerable increase in Omicron infections.""

However, in Belgium, where the number of infections is also relatively low, the government changed its mind on Wednesday, deciding to allow theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court temporarily stopped their closure. In the meantime, other European nations are still struggling with the Delta variant.

30,30_0,0,"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city.","It seems that Ukrainian forces have moved closer to retaking Kreminna, a strategically important city in the Luhansk province that is currently controlled by Russia. Intense fighting is ongoing in both the east and south of the country. Serhiy Haidai, the regional governor of Luhansk, reported that soldiers in a part of the city under Russian control were forced to withdraw to Rubizhne, a town situated a few kilometres to the south-east. This retreat was due to the increased pressure from the Ukrainian military. “The Russians realise that if they lose Kreminna, their entire defensive line will collapse,” Haidai posted on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. He also noted, “The Russian occupying forces managed to construct very strong defences over a month, or perhaps a little longer. They are bringing in a large number of reinforcements and equipment. They are constantly replenishing their forces.” The Guardian newspaper has not been able to independently verify these developments on the ground. If Ukrainian forces were to recapture Kreminna and the nearby town of Svatove, it could pave the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. These are two cities that Ukraine lost during the summer. This intense fighting is taking place while there is no indication that peace talks are about to start. On Monday evening, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands for “demilitarisation and denazification” or face defeat in the war. Lavrov’s comments suggest that the Kremlin has no plans to back down from its ambitious goals of changing the government in Ukraine. This is despite Vladimir Putin's claims on Sunday that Russia was prepared for discussions to end the conflict. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, the British Ministry of Defence said that Russian troops are continuing to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, along with fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been attempting to capture Bakhmut since July, after they reached the city’s outskirts. Bakhmut has been extensively damaged after almost five months of fighting and both sides have described it as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is considered a significant test for Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian prisoners to assist in attacking the city."
30,30_1,1,"Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory. Since the start of the war, a number of military targets, including oil and weapon depots have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks inside Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as payback.","Yevgeny Prigozhin has frequently criticised the Russian Ministry of Defence regarding their handling of the war in Ukraine. He has also praised Wagner Group, claiming it's Russia's most effective fighting unit. A video released on Monday, supposedly filmed close to Bakhmut, is likely to intensify rumours about disagreements within the Russian army. The video shows two men, who seem to be Wagner soldiers, making insults about Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff. ""You are... the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no ammunition,"" one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian was unable to confirm the video's authenticity independently. However, when Russian journalists asked Prigozhin about it, he seemed to support the soldiers' actions, saying he had gone to Bakhmut to meet them. ""The guys asked me to let you know that when you're sitting in a comfortable office, it's difficult to understand the problems on the front line,"" Prigozhin said in a statement, in what seemed to be a direct criticism of the country's top military leaders. Last Thursday, Ukraine announced that Russia had ""moved"" some of its aircraft away from Engels airfield. Moscow had reported that the airfield was hit by a Ukrainian drone the day before, causing the deaths of three Russian soldiers. ""Following yesterday's widely reported events, we can see that the planes are being dispersed, specifically strategic aviation... Of course, some aircraft still remain, but many have already been moved to different airfields,"" Colonel Yuriy Ignat, the main spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. In other news, Russian security services announced they had ""eliminated"" four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia's southern Bryansk region, near the Ukrainian border. If this is true, the event highlights the ongoing activities of Ukrainian sabotage groups inside Russian territory. Since the beginning of the war, several military locations, including oil and weapons storage facilities, have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv doesn't openly admit to carrying out attacks inside Russia, but has previously celebrated such incidents as acts of revenge."

31,31_0,0,"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce.","As China rapidly relaxes its strict anti-COVID measures, European countries are planning to increase their monitoring of possible new coronavirus variants that could emerge from the country. Spain and France have reintroduced mandatory testing at airports for travellers arriving from China.

On Friday, both countries followed Italy's example by requiring passengers arriving from China to present a negative COVID-19 test. However, unlike Italy, Spain will make exceptions for travellers who can prove they have been fully vaccinated. At a press conference where she announced Spain's new rules, the country's health minister, Carolina Darias, also stated that she was working to change the requirements for travellers to obtain the EU's digital COVID certificate.

A surge in infections across China, along with concerns about the accuracy of the official data provided by the Chinese government, has led to the return of COVID checks in several countries outside the EU, including the United States, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The UK has also announced it will implement similar measures.

Chinese state media has described the reintroduction of testing requirements for travellers from China as ""discriminatory"" and claims that the measures are politically motivated, designed to damage China's reopening efforts.

However, in Brussels, Berlin, and Paris, officials stated this week that it was important to remain watchful, but that it was too early to be overly concerned about the outbreak in China, the world's most populated nation. Germany's health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said that it was ""not yet necessary"" to bring back mandatory testing for travellers entering the Schengen area from China via Germany. The centre-left politician explained that the data on COVID variants provided by Beijing was not trustworthy enough. ""And therefore, we really have to rely on doing that ourselves,"" he said, suggesting closer examination of individual flights as an example.

The European Commission's health policy chief urged the EU's 27 member states on Friday to think about increasing gene sequencing of COVID-19 infections and monitoring wastewater, including wastewater from airports, to identify any new variants that might be brought in from China.

In a letter to the health ministers of the EU member states, Stella Kyriakides said that the bloc should be ""very vigilant"" when China lifts its travel restrictions on January 8th, because reliable data about the spread of the virus and testing in China is limited."
31,31_1,1,"In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, argued that requiring Covid tests for all passengers from China was “only effective if it is taken at the European level”, noting that many people arrive in Italy on connecting flights through other European countries. After an announcement made by Italy’s health ministry on Thursday, travellers from China are obliged to show a negative test result upon embarking on their flight and to take a second antigen test upon their arrival.","According to a Reuters report, Kyriakides suggested in her letter that ministers should, without delay, examine how they are currently performing gene sequencing of the coronavirus.

Following an announcement by the Italian health ministry on Thursday, people travelling from China are now required to present proof of a negative Covid-19 test before boarding their flight. They will also need to undergo a second antigen test once they land in Italy."

Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration.","Brazil is preparing for a New Year that will be one of the most significant in its history, as the South American country gets ready to welcome a new president and at the same time, say goodbye to one of its most celebrated figures. Large crowds are expected to gather in Brasilia on January 1st to witness Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva being sworn in for a four-year term. Then, just a day later, football fans will come together in Santos to pay their respects to Pelé, the legendary footballer who sadly passed away on Thursday.

Edson Arantes do Nascimento died from multiple organ failure after fighting colon cancer for over a year. The 82-year-old, who previously played for Santos and the New York Cosmos, had been in hospital for over a month. ""The city is deeply saddened,"" said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who reported on Santos during their successful period in the 1960s and remained a friend of both Pelé and his family. ""Everyone here is feeling a sense of loss because Pelé was such an integral part of our lives. He brought us so much happiness. It’s as if we’ve lost someone from our own family.”

Brazilian funerals typically take place within 24 hours of someone's death, but it is understood that Pelé's family requested more time to allow family members to come together for what is anticipated to be a very emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children, as well as many grandchildren. Some of his family live in the United States, while others are spread throughout Brazil, a country almost the size of Europe. Significant crowds are expected to gather in the city and the surrounding area, which is home to nearly 2 million people. The world’s media will also be present in large numbers.

The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was actually named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday indicated that the right-wing president would be flying to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the presidential sash to his left-leaning successor. In his final speech as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet, and also criticised one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to bomb a fuel truck before Sunday's inauguration."

Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides.","The threat of terrorism has created a somber atmosphere in Brasilia, and while the weekend is expected to be both exciting and nerve-wracking, it's possible that events on the following day will draw even more attention. Even though important figures from over 120 countries are scheduled to be at Lula's inauguration, Pelé's death is a story that resonates worldwide, and the preparations for his final farewell are being treated as a major state event. Presidents, prime ministers, famous athletes, and former teammates all shared messages of support and condolences after his death was announced on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro declared three days of national mourning. The incoming president, Lula, stated, “Few Brazilians have promoted our country as much as he did. Despite the fact that their language was different from Portuguese, people from all over the world always managed to say the magical word: ‘Pelé.’” In a serious message, the president of Santos, the football club where Pelé became famous, said that he would never be forgotten. “Pelé didn't die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He arrived in Santos as a young boy, and he left as a king. He was admired not only by Santos supporters but by all of Brazil and all football enthusiasts. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos has confirmed that Pelé's body will remain at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until early Monday morning, when it will be transported 80 kilometers down the coast to the club's Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be placed in the middle of the field, and fans will be permitted to enter the stadium to pay their respects. His body will remain in the center circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.

32,32_2,2,"The former athlete of the century will be laid to rest at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies that claims to be the tallest in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a space on the ninth floor of the building almost two decades ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out. Pelé is loved by people here and by fans of the club because he projected the name of Santos all over the world.”","The legendary athlete, often considered the greatest of all time, will be buried at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica. This unusual cemetery, built vertically, boasts enough space for 18,000 bodies and is said to be the world's tallest of its kind. According to the newspaper O Globo, Pelé himself selected and paid for his burial plot almost twenty years ago. He specifically chose a location on the ninth floor of the building. This was because his father, Dondinho, played football wearing the number 9 shirt, making it a significant number for him. Furthermore, the chosen spot offers a clear view of the Vila Belmiro stadium. Pelé selected this particular location because it gave him a sense of ""spiritual peace and tranquility,"" and, according to O Globo, because it ""didn't look like a cemetery."" Dias commented on the upcoming public memorial, anticipating a large turnout. ""I think there will be a lot of people,"" he said. ""The city is getting ready, and people will definitely come. Pelé is deeply loved by the people here and by the football club's supporters, because he made the name of Santos famous all over the world."""
33,33_0,0,"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","At the beginning of 2022, while many parts of the world were dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and the growing threat of war in Ukraine, China was experiencing a period of relative stability. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid policy seemed to be effective, and infection rates were low. Lockdowns were in place, but they were well-managed, and the population generally followed the rules. This stability was likely the environment Xi Jinping wanted as he prepared to take on a historic third term as leader of a China that was becoming increasingly influential. His plans included economic leadership, tight control within the country, taking control of Taiwan, and increasing China’s power on the global stage. However, as 2022 comes to an end and 2023 approaches, China finds itself in an unfamiliar and challenging situation. Over the past year, the country has faced significant problems with its housing market and economy. There was also a period of tension in the Taiwan Strait in August, sanctions from Western countries due to China’s human rights record, and restrictions from the US on its rapidly growing computer chip industry. Furthermore, China's relationship with Russia has been complicated. Xi Jinping did achieve his third term as president, but just a few weeks later, protests erupted across the country, featuring remarkably courageous acts of disagreement with the government, which seemed to signal a sudden end to the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of triumph for the Chinese president, but instead, according to experienced China expert Jerome Cohen, it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over.” He adds, “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th Party Congress in October, Xi Jinping secured a third five-year term, making him the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong. This move overturned the system that his predecessors had put in place specifically to prevent too much power from being concentrated in the hands of one person. He also established “Xi Jinping Thought” as the central idea of the party’s platform and removed members of a rival group, symbolized by the surprising removal of the former president Hu Jintao, the leader of that group, from the Congress hall. Xi Jinping's now unrestricted political power has caused concern about the decisions he might make, especially considering he is surrounded by people who always agree with him. ""Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,"" says Professor Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute."
33,33_1,1,"“Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn.","While Xi Jinping probably believes his political philosophy (""Xi Jinping Thought"") provides a solid plan for China's future, his actions are actually leading the country into uncertain and untested situations. Perhaps the most concerning of Xi's ambitions is the potential annexation of Taiwan, although experts don't anticipate an immediate attempt to seize the island.

Over the last year, there has been an unprecedented surge in Chinese military activity directed at Taiwan, which operates as a self-governed democracy. In August, the first official document on Taiwan published under Xi's leadership reaffirmed the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) readiness to use military force to take control of the island. Nancy Pelosi, the US House Speaker, visited Taipei, which Beijing used as an excuse to showcase its strength, intensifying its already aggressive military harassment to unprecedented levels.

The United States plays a crucial role in the relationship between China and Taiwan. It has been increasing its support for Taiwan, suggesting it might grant the island a status similar to a ""non-major NATO ally"" and approving significant defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, from Tamkang University in Taiwan, suggests that China is unable to effectively challenge the US directly and therefore focuses its response on Taiwan and its 23.5 million citizens. It is expected that cognitive and cyber warfare, as well as economic pressure, will increase in the run-up to Taiwan's next presidential elections in early 2024.

Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, a think tank based in Washington, states that China will likely increase its coercive actions against Taiwan, especially while the Democratic Progressive Party, which leans towards independence, remains in power.

On Monday, Taiwan reported that 71 Chinese air force aircraft, including fighter jets and drones, had entered the island's air defence identification zone in the previous 24 hours. This was the largest reported incursion to date.

The CCP's actions regarding Taiwan have significantly contributed to the decline in Xi's relationship with Western countries. The party's ongoing persecution of dissidents in Hong Kong and the human rights abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN's human rights chief suggested in August could be considered crimes against humanity – have also widened the gap. Relations were further strained by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, occurring only weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin declared a friendship with ""no limits,"" an invasion Beijing has refused to condemn."
33,33_2,2,"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”. Zero-Covid restrictions and the near collapse of the property development sector punished China’s economy this year.","The invasion created a difficult political situation for Xi Jinping, leaving him in a challenging position internationally for the duration of the war. He has been trying to manage his relationship with Putin, his desire to avoid being affected by sanctions against Russia, and the ongoing competition between China and Russia for influence and trade opportunities in Central Asia. US officials stated in March that Putin had requested military assistance from China. While Beijing didn't provide weapons, it has offered support in other ways, including what appears to be collaboration on spreading propaganda and false information, and arguing against Western sanctions. Chinese officials have openly supported the invasion, and the armed forces of both countries have recently carried out joint military exercises.

Furthermore, incidents involving Chinese diplomats have strained Xi's relationship with Western countries. In December, China's consul general in Manchester, England, along with five other diplomats, were recalled to Beijing and avoided being questioned by UK police regarding their involvement in the assault of a pro-democracy protester from Hong Kong outside the consulate in October.

However, international relations remain important to Xi. After securing his third term in office, he actively engaged on the global stage, holding discussions with numerous heads of state, including Joe Biden. According to Cohen, Xi is attempting to improve his government's reputation ""after a period of particularly assertive and controversial policies.""

Xi's attempts to build bridges will test the international community, which has adopted a stricter approach towards China's human rights record this year, according to Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. ""I'm concerned that, following these efforts to improve relations, many governments, such as Germany, might ease their stance on China, putting human rights issues aside once again,"" she said.

Currently, government positions remain firm, and the US is continuing with measures, including sanctions targeting China's semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to support. This is causing difficulties for Xi's plans to revitalize the struggling Chinese economy. Tsang, from SOAS University, suggests that these measures ""may have a more significant and widespread impact [than Covid] on the Chinese economy in 2023."" The Chinese economy suffered this year due to the strict Zero-Covid policy and the near collapse of the property development industry."
33,33_3,3,"To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone. A faltering economy could further provoke domestic frustrations, which peaked in 2022 over the impact of Xi’s signature hardline zero-Covid policy. For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled. With no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel restrictions or mass testing, Covid cases have soared across China. Mass fatalities are predicted, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus.","To deal with the property market crisis, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has allocated 1.4 trillion yuan (equivalent to £166 billion) to restart building projects. Analysts at Trivium believe this funding ""will enable developers to start increasing construction"" and help to stimulate China's economy. However, the government will still have to face the economic consequences of the zero-COVID policy and the expected waves of new outbreaks now that the policy has been abandoned. A struggling economy could lead to even more dissatisfaction among the population, which reached its highest point in 2022 due to the effects of Xi Jinping's strict zero-COVID policy. For two years, China implemented this strategy, which allowed most people to live relatively normal lives and kept the death rate low. But then, the highly infectious Omicron variant overwhelmed the system, causing economic and social disruption. As people became less and less tolerant of the frequent, sudden, and poorly managed lockdowns, occasional protests broke out. These were further fuelled by a series of tragic incidents, including a bus crash involving people in quarantine and a fire in a building in Xinjiang that was under lockdown. These protests became the most significant in China since 1989 and were primarily against the restrictions imposed by the zero-COVID policy. However, complaints about censorship and negative feelings towards Xi Jinping were also expressed. The protests raised awareness among some Chinese people about the government's treatment of minorities and those who disagree with the government. According to Cohen, ""The pandemic disaster has increased public awareness of the party's lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has created, despite its significant efforts to establish a system of 'rule by law'."" The authorities quickly responded with a police crackdown to suppress the dissent. However, the protests seemed to have had an impact because, within a week, the zero-COVID system, which many believed would remain in place for many more months or even years, was suddenly removed. Without any more lockdowns, quarantines, travel restrictions, or mass testing, COVID cases have increased rapidly across China. Many deaths are expected, with estimates suggesting that up to a million people could die from the virus."
33,33_4,4,"On Monday, in his first remarks on Covid since the shift in policy, Xi urged officials to take steps to “feasibly protect people’s lives” and said: “We should launch the patriotic health campaign in a more targeted way ... fortify a community line of defence for epidemic prevention and control, and feasibly protect people’s lives, safety and health.” Trivium says what happens next with Covid and Covid policy is “the most important question” politically and economically, for China and Xi in 2023: “It’s not at all clear how this plays out.” The past year has brought far more for China than Xi would have hoped, or analysts expected. Tsang says that, in the end, events have still largely worked out for Xi, even if protests took the shine off his leadership. “He mostly got what he wanted, including not just a third term as top leader but also a leadership filled by his supporters,” says Tsang. “It is less clear that it was equally good for China, as Xi’s amassing of near dictatorial power is costing China dearly.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin","On Monday, in his first comments regarding Covid since the policy change, Xi encouraged government officials to take actions that would realistically safeguard people's lives. He stated, ""We should implement the patriotic health campaign in a more focused manner... strengthen the community's defenses against the epidemic, and effectively protect people's lives, safety, and health.""

Trivium Research believes that the future of Covid and related policies represents ""the most important question"" both politically and economically for China and for Xi himself in 2023. They add, ""It’s not at all certain how this will unfold.""

The past year has presented China with challenges exceeding both Xi's expectations and those of analysts. According to Tsang, despite the protests somewhat diminishing his image, events have generally turned out favourably for Xi. ""He largely achieved his goals, including not only securing a third term as the top leader but also establishing a leadership composed of his allies,"" Tsang explains. ""However, it’s less apparent that this has been equally beneficial for China, as Xi's accumulation of almost dictatorial power is proving to be very costly for the country.""

34,34_0,0,"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","As China experiences a surge of COVID-19 infections that is putting immense pressure on city hospitals and intensive care units, the country is bracing itself for another wave expected to affect its more susceptible rural areas in early 2023. The Lunar New Year, China's most significant holiday, occurs in late January and offers a long-awaited opportunity for families to reunite after years of strict internal travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by the previous zero-COVID policy. However, it is anticipated that as hundreds of millions of workers travel back to their hometowns, many will carry the virus with them to areas with fewer hospitals and clinics, a shortage of medical staff, limited equipment and medication, and less financial support to cover medical expenses.

One user from a small town in central Henan province posted on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, stating: “When faced with a virus like Omicron, everyone should be treated equally, but the reality is that urban and rural areas are not equal in terms of the virus' impact. Not only are resources and opportunities unequal, but there is also a significant difference in understanding how to manage public health.""

Airfinity, a British health analytics company, predicts that the next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas towards the end of winter, potentially impacting even more people than the current outbreak in cities. The impact could be worsened by the government’s sudden change in its public information campaign regarding COVID-19. The virus was previously presented as a serious threat to be avoided at nearly all costs, but now Chinese citizens are being told that it is no more serious than a common cold.

The WeChat user from Henan also noted, ""In my hometown, they've subtly changed the way they talk about getting sick. They say, ‘Every family has caught the cold,’ so there’s nothing to worry about.” This attitude means that there is little official encouragement of basic preventative measures like social distancing, which could help to slow down the spread of the disease and potentially give overburdened hospitals some much-needed relief.

Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, commented, “I am very surprised that the public message seems to be denying the extent of the suffering caused by this wave, and, as far as I can see, there is no communication about how to slow down the infection rate to reduce the burden on the overwhelmed health system.”"
34,34_1,1,"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","Therefore, I anticipate extremely high numbers of deaths, similar to what models have predicted based on the experiences of Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, potentially reaching around 1 million. Some analysts believe that in certain city areas, Covid has spread so quickly that infections might reach their highest point soon. However, it's hard to track the progress of the disease accurately because when China reduced its Covid restrictions, it also stopped publishing regular updates on Covid statistics. China used to be proud of its Covid data. But as deaths and infections increased, the National Health Commission (NHC) announced that it would no longer publish a daily count of deaths. On Friday, despite widespread pictures and reports of hospitals being overwhelmed with patients, the NHC stated that there had been only one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to AFP news agency. In contrast, Airfinity, a health information company, estimates that approximately 9,000 people are dying from Covid in China every day. They predict this could increase to as many as 25,000 deaths per day next month, and forecast that the total number of deaths could reach up to 1.7 million by April. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, acknowledged this week that China was not including many deaths in their official figures that would be considered Covid-related deaths in other countries, AFP reported. In many other countries, any death occurring within 28 days of a positive Covid test is counted. However, Beijing has decided to only count those who die specifically from respiratory failure caused directly by the virus. “China has always been committed to using scientific standards to determine Covid-19 deaths, consistently following international guidelines,” Jiao stated. While Chinese media outlets are claiming that the government’s sudden change in strategy on the pandemic – from strict controls to allowing the disease to spread more freely – has been handled perfectly, social media is full of concerning and difficult stories of life during the pandemic. Chinese authorities usually act quickly to suppress online disagreement and criticism. However, a surprisingly large number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are appearing online and remaining visible for some time, according to Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a website that monitors internet censorship. “The majority of these posts are staying online because the rules regarding censorship are changing so rapidly that the censors are unable to keep up.”"
