0,0_0,0,"Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and rose all the way to its top but even he struggles to recall a Latin American year like 2019. “Like this? Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim started working for Brazil's government in foreign affairs almost sixty years ago. He worked his way up to the highest position. But even he finds it hard to remember a year like 2019 in Latin America. ""Like this? Never before,"" said the former foreign minister of Brazil, talking about the difficult year. In those twelve months, many countries in the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá, experienced big social and political problems.

The last year of the decade had only just started when the problems began. Just 23 days into the year, people in Venezuela started protesting strongly in the streets. Most people thought this would force the leader, Nicolás Maduro, to leave his position. There were many protests and predictions that Maduro would soon fall. A military attempt to overthrow him failed. Then, Juan Guaidó's efforts to remove Hugo Chávez's successor did not succeed, and things became quiet again.

But in other places, the problems were just beginning. Big protests and violence happened in Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador, and Bolivia. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales was forced to leave his job after a violent crackdown by the military. This made some people wonder if a ""Latin American Spring"" had begun, like the Arab Spring.

In Peru, the president closed the congress. In Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner made a surprising return to politics. And in Colombia, hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets to protest against the right-wing president, Iván Duque.

Even Chile, which was thought to be a stable and wealthy country in Latin America, was affected by the chaos. A small increase in the price of subway tickets led to the worst unrest in decades. This caused a lot of damage, and President Sebastián Piñera's future was uncertain. ""Where did that come from?"" asked Ivan Briscoe, the head of the International Crisis Group for Latin America, when he thought about the unexpected problems in Chile. As a new year with more uncertainty was coming, Briscoe said he felt that things were happening very quickly in the region."
0,0_1,1,"“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","Things have been developing for many years. These things include: the different social classes in Chile; Evo Morales trying to stay in power forever in Bolivia; and the very unfriendly situation in Venezuela. Now, these problems seem to be appearing in many different places, and we really don't know what will happen.

Someone said, ""I can tell you what the main problems will be next year. But I can't say exactly what will happen.""

Some people on the left in Latin America feel better because things are so confusing. Amorim, who is 77, said that the problems are a result of people reacting against the ""attack of neoliberalism"" that is affecting countries from Colombia to Chile.

He said, ""It's hard to know where we are going. But one thing is different: eight months ago, it seemed like everything was becoming very right-wing. Now it's not so clear. So, even with all the problems, this is a kind of improvement. Latin America is going through a difficult time. But for the left, this difficulty is better than nothing happening at all.""

As the year ends, people are thinking about what will happen next. In a new report, the Economist Intelligence Unit warned that protests could spread easily. They said that the protests in Colombia were inspired by protests in other countries nearby.

The report said, ""There is a good chance that 2020 will be another difficult year for Latin America."" They predicted that things would be especially tough in Ecuador, under the leadership of Lenín Moreno.

Amorim agreed, saying, ""It's like a barrel of gunpowder. That country could explode again at any time.""

Briscoe thought there would be three likely problem areas in 2020: Venezuela, as its political and humanitarian situation got worse; Brazil and Argentina, as the leaders who have very different ideas argued more; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is finding it hard to control the high number of murders, with almost 100 people being killed every day."
0,0_2,2,"Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.","In 2014, big protests happened in Mexico. This was after 43 students disappeared, which made the country very upset. Briscoe said that if the killings didn't stop, these protests could happen again.

Briscoe also thought there could be problems in Bolivia. This was if Luis Fernando Camacho, who is very right-wing, got to the second part of the new presidential election. If he had to compete against someone from Evo Morales’s left-wing party, Movement Towards Socialism, there could be trouble.

“I think we will have a difficult time… In Colombia, Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, things could easily go wrong,"" said Briscoe. “We have a lot of angry people who are not happy with the way things are,"" he added. He also said that Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Chile could also be “dangerous places.”

People don't agree about whether Brazil, which is the biggest country in Latin America for money, might also have problems. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who used to be the president, told his supporters to “do what Chile did” and protest against the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is very right-wing.

Some people think that Bolsonaro's surprising win in the 2018 election has stopped people from protesting in the streets, at least for now. But Monica de Bolle, who knows a lot about Latin America from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that Brazil could easily be the next country with problems.

“Right now, people aren't going to go out and protest. But things change all the time,"" she said. ""I think it's very likely that soon – maybe in 2020 or by the end of 2020 – people will realize that the economy isn't going to get much better because the right things aren't being done and there's no plan... and then Bolsonaro's support will quickly go down.”

“That could cause problems like we've seen in Brazil before. It could even be like what happened in 2013,” she said. She was talking about the big protests that led to Dilma Rousseff being removed from her job three years later.

Amorim also thought that his country could face problems because people are getting more and more angry about Bolsonaro's mistakes."
0,0_3,3,"“There hasn’t yet been a popular reaction [against Bolsonaro] – but I think it will come. If there’s a small spark it could very easily propagate,” he said. But perhaps not quite yet. “Everything here in Brazil is slow,” Amorim admitted. “Except samba.”","He said that people haven't really reacted against Bolsonaro yet, but he thinks they will. He thinks that if something small happens, it could easily spread and make a big difference. But maybe it won't happen right away. Amorim said that things in Brazil happen slowly. He added that samba is the only thing that isn't slow."
1,1_0,0,"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago.","In Iraq, protesters have shown their anger towards the United States by attacking the American embassy in Baghdad. Diplomats were stuck inside the building while people outside shouted ""Death to America"" and showed support for groups in Iraq who support Iran.

It was a bad day for the United States. Hundreds of protesters surrounded the US embassy. They broke through the main gate and damaged some of the rooms inside. They started fires, broke down doors, and threw stones at the strong glass windows.

It seemed like the Iraqi security forces helped the protesters by letting them enter the Green Zone, which is usually very protected. The protesters then went to the embassy, climbed the walls, and threw stones. American guards used tear gas, but they didn't shoot.

Donald Trump said that Iran organized the attack, which happened after the US attacked some camps in Iraq and Syria on Sunday. These camps belonged to a group called Kata’ib Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran and is officially part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and many more were hurt in the US attacks.

US officials said the attacks were to stop more bad actions after the group fired rockets at a US base in Kirkuk on Friday. One American working for the US was killed, and four Americans were injured. President Trump agreed to the attacks on Saturday.

It seems these attacks have not helped the US. Instead, they look like another mistake in the Middle East. The Iraqi government was very angry about the attacks, and groups that support Iran said they would attack American places again to make US forces leave Iraq.

Trump wrote on Twitter: ""Iran killed an American worker and hurt many people. We fought back strongly, and we always will. Now Iran is organizing an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be responsible for what happens.""

The US embassy said that reports from the Iraqi foreign ministry about the ambassador and his staff quickly leaving were not true. A spokesperson from the embassy told CNN that the US ambassador to Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was on holiday and had left Baghdad a week before."
1,1_1,1,"The embassy was under lockdown but had not been evacuated, the spokesperson said, with diplomats sheltering in a safe-room. Video from the scene showed thick grey smoke engulfing the compound against a backdrop of wailing from an emergency siren. Protesters shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. By nightfall fires were still burning. One masked man walked off insouciantly with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part.","The embassy was closed and no one was allowed to leave, but the spokesperson said that people had not been taken out of the country. Diplomats were staying in a secure room for safety. Videos from the area showed thick grey smoke covering the building, and there was a loud siren sound. People protesting were shouting “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. At night, the fires were still burning. One person with a mask took an official sign from the US embassy and walked away without seeming to care. Some people who used to work for the government said that the events reminded them of when the US embassy in Tehran was attacked in 1979. At that time, 52 American citizens were taken as prisoners. However, what happened on Tuesday was not as serious. Nobody died, and most of the embassy building was not damaged. But there is a big worry that the conflict between US soldiers and Iranian supporters in Iraq could get worse. The way the Trump government is putting pressure on Tehran with punishments and money problems doesn’t seem to have helped much. Also, the relationship with Iraq is now very bad. The prime minister of Iraq, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, who is friends with both Iran and Washington, promised on Tuesday that he would keep the American people safe. At first, Iraqi security forces did little to stop the violence, but in the afternoon they arrived in large numbers and made a line to protect the US guards from the angry protesters. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that the US would “protect and defend its people” when he spoke to Abdul-Mahdi on the phone. Now, it is not clear if the US can continue to have its embassy in Baghdad, which is the biggest one in the world. This is because the protesters have put up tents outside the embassy. Many of the protesters came from funerals in Baghdad for some soldiers who had died. They were carrying flags of Kata’ib Hezbollah and Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces). Kata’ib Hezbollah is part of this strong group of fighters."
1,1_2,2,"Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the Iranian-backed Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq militia, and many other senior militia leaders were among the demonstrators. On Monday, Iran condemned the US strikes as “terrorism”. Russia complained it had not been given advance warning. Street protests take place regularly in the Iraqi capital. In recent months, security guards have shot dead more than 450 people protesting against rampant government corruption and the growing influence of Iranian-backed groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah.","Qais al-Khazali, who is the leader of the Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq group, which Iran supports, was at the protests.

In the last few months, security guards have shot and killed more than 450 people who were protesting. These people were angry about a lot of government corruption and because groups that Iran supports, like Kata’ib Hezbollah, are becoming more powerful."

The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes.","A small earthquake happened near the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran on Friday. The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake had a magnitude of 5.1.

This was a medium-sized earthquake, and these kinds of earthquakes can cause a lot of damage. The centre of the earthquake was 53 kilometres (33 miles) east of Bushehr. Bushehr is a nuclear plant on the southern coast of Iran, near the Persian Gulf.

The earthquake happened at 5:23 in the morning local time (1:53 AM in London). It was not very deep, only 38 kilometres below the ground.

Iranian state television said that they have not heard of any damage yet. They said, ""We have not received any news about damage from the earthquake."" An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause a lot of damage.

The Bushehr nuclear power plant was built to be strong and resist much bigger earthquakes. Jahangir Dehqan, who is in charge of the emergency department in the area, told the ISNA news agency: ""So far, we have not heard about any damage. The Red Crescent Society, local leaders, and other officials have checked the area.""

Iran is located on many big fault lines, so earthquakes happen there almost every day. In 2003, a big earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 destroyed the old city of Bam and killed 26,000 people. Bam is close to the Bushehr nuclear plant, but the plant was not damaged then.

In 2019, Iran said they would make uranium stronger than what was allowed in the 2015 nuclear agreement. This happened after Donald Trump took the United States out of the agreement last year. Iran says that its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes, like making electricity."
3,3_0,0,"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said.","The Hungarian mangalica pig has lived for almost 200 years and has had a difficult life. It was first created by an emperor, and later almost disappeared because of communists. This pig is big and heavy, and it has a coat like a sheep. It is the pig with the most hair and fat. Many people who like it say that the mangalica is also one of the most delicious pigs.

About 30 years ago, there were very few mangalica pigs left. But in the last 10 years, they have become popular again on farms, on dinner tables, and with Hungarian people. Now, they are also becoming popular in fancy restaurants around the world, from the US to Japan. In Japan, people call it “Kobe pork” because its fat looks like marble.

In Hungary, the mangalica pig is now officially a national treasure. But this important part of Hungarian farming is now in danger again. African swine fever, a disease that is spreading in Eastern Europe, is killing many pigs.

Also, because mangalica pigs are becoming more popular, this is causing arguments with countries near Hungary. Recently, a famous American food blogger said in a video that mangalica was a “medieval Romanian food.” The video was watched almost a million times on YouTube, and it made people very angry. Hungary used to rule part of Romania, and there is still tension about this. The Hungarian newspapers were very upset.

One news website said, “It wasn't enough that they took Transylvania. They are trying to take our culture and our history. Now they also want to steal mangalica from us.”

Péter Tóth, who is in charge of the Mangalica Breeders Association in Hungary, said, “It could become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel.” He said this while he was eating mangalica ham in a nice restaurant in Budapest. He also said that even though all the mangalica pigs in Romania now came from Hungary, the history of the pig is international."
3,3_1,1,"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic.","This type of pig was made in the 1830s. The emperor in Vienna, who was from the Habsburg family, got 11 fat, long-haired pigs from the prince of Serbia. He had these pigs breed with some old Hungarian pigs near Arad, which is now in Romania.

At one time, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica pigs. People liked the high fat content because they could store the lard (pig fat) for much longer than the meat. But when electricity and fridges became common, people didn't need as much lard, so there were fewer mangalica pigs. They became more of a special, expensive product.

After the Second World War, the communist government almost got rid of the mangalica pigs. Only about 300 female pigs were kept in special areas for scientists to study. You couldn't buy the meat anywhere.

In the early 1990s, a young student named Tóth was studying to be a vet in Spain. He told a Spanish friend about the fat Hungarian pigs. Together, they started a project to save the mangalica. Tóth said, ""I put ads in local newspapers asking people to tell me if they had seen a mangalica pig.""

He bought all the mangalica pigs he could find. For several years, he used money from Spain to breed them. By the late 1990s, they had enough fat pork to send to Spain to be cured.

Now, there are more than 200 farmers in Hungary who raise mangalica pigs. You can buy the meat in almost every market, but it costs about four times more than normal pork.

Zsóka Fekete runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary. She said, ""It's different from any other meat. It has a marbled texture, especially in the neck. It tastes completely different."" She used to work for a big company in Budapest. But in 2012, she decided to go back to her family farm and buy 20 female mangalica pigs. Now she has 300.

She has many regular customers, including top restaurants and people in Budapest who love mangalica meat. They wait in lines to buy her meat when she goes to the city every two weeks.

The only problem for the mangalica pig now is a disease called African swine fever."
3,3_2,2,"The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”","In Hungary, the first cases of a disease were found in wild boars last April. This disease is very easily spread. So far, no farm pigs have caught it. But because it spreads so easily, if a dead boar with the disease is found, all pigs within 3 kilometers must be killed.

This is especially dangerous for mangalica pigs, because they live partly outside. New safety steps have been taken, like putting up two fences and stopping people from visiting the farms. Up to now, about 1,200 mangalica pigs have been killed in Hungary. This is more than 10% of all mangalica pigs in the country.

Mr. Tóth said that the government has made a plan to protect the mangalica pigs if the problem gets worse. They will create a system to save the genes of the pigs. Also, the best mangalica pigs will be moved to safe places, like zoos or universities.

Some people are worried about how eating meat affects the climate. But it will probably be a long time before this changes how much meat people eat in Hungary. In Hungary, pork is everywhere, and being vegetarian is still seen as strange.

But Mr. Tóth surprised people by saying that Hungarians should eat less meat. “I don’t like the poor quality of meat and the way animals suffer on big farms,” he said. He then picked up a piece of mangalica ham with a fork. “People should eat less meat, for sure. But when they eat meat, it should be good quality. For example, one piece of mangalica pig per week.”"
4,4_0,0,"The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.","The protests happening all across India about the changes to citizenship in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are encouraging. They show us that Indian democracy is strong and active at a local level. This is happening even though the current members of parliament have not respected the constitution fully (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December).

This constitution was carefully discussed and created over three years by the people in the assembly. These people were trained in fighting for independence. They took control from the British government in a special way, showing moral and political fairness that revealed what British colonialism was really like. Henry Maine said that British India was a ""very strange experiment"" where a ""free people"" had ""almost total control"" over another country.

The independent country of India that was created in 1947, even with the violent conflicts at the beginning, did keep its promise in some ways. For the next 70 years, it provided its citizens with ""a free, fair, and democratic country"" with justice, freedom, and equal rights for everyone. The constitutional problem that India is facing today is because of a quick decision that was made based on religious ideas. This decision goes against the dream of the people who created this great and diverse nation and its important constitution.

Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Regarding your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes, this is terrible, and I am grateful you shared it. However, I would be happy if you could also mention England's role in colonialism in Canada. This started with Rupert’s Land, which was taken over easily in 1670, leading to the Hudson Bay Company taking resources from that area. Everything about how Canada is today began in England. England has gained a lot from colonialism in Canada. I am not saying the current Canadian government is not responsible for continuing this, but your article doesn't properly explain the real context that acknowledges England’s responsibility."

5,5_0,0,"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family’s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian café, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again.","Food:

Brexit has caused problems for restaurants. Because the British pound is not as strong as it used to be, it costs more to buy ingredients from other countries. Also, it hasn't been clear if people from EU countries can stay and work in the UK. This has created problems for restaurant workers, especially those who work with customers.

Even though we now know that the UK will leave the EU at the end of January, things probably won't get better for restaurants in 2020. Restaurant owners and chefs say that it is more difficult than before to keep workers from other countries. These workers are worried about their future in the UK, and it is understandable.

The food processing industry has a similar problem. In the past, many workers in this industry came from Eastern European countries. When it's hard to keep staff, companies usually have to pay them more money to encourage them to stay. Then, these companies have to charge customers more to cover the extra costs. So, we can expect that the prices of food and eating out will increase in the next year.

At the end of 2019, a group of scientists from around the world wrote a letter about climate change. They said that countries should decide when they will stop increasing the amount of meat they produce. People are already eating less meat. For example, the Greggs bakery now sells a vegan sausage roll. In the next year, we will see even more vegetarian and vegan food options. More restaurants will add vegetarian and vegan dishes to their menus.

As for new food trends, it looks like African food might become more popular, at least in London. A Nigerian restaurant called Chuku's will open a permanent location in February, after being successful as a temporary restaurant. Also, William JM Chilila, who was on the MasterChef TV show, will open a West African restaurant called Akoko around the same time.

Three people to watch:

Nisha Katona used to be a lawyer, but she decided to leave that job and start an Indian café called Mowgli. She wanted to share her family's Indian food that she learned to cook at home. Her restaurant started in her hometown of Liverpool and is now a group of ten restaurants. She plans to open at least four more restaurants in 2020 and has already found places for another four."
5,5_1,1,"Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.","Daniel Humm is the newest American chef to come to Britain. He wants to become very successful here. He has three Michelin stars for his restaurant Eleven Madison Park in New York. He has just opened a new restaurant at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair. Before him, Simon Rogan’s restaurant Fera was there, and before that, Gordon Ramsay’s. But those restaurants didn't become very successful. Humm hopes that his new restaurant, called Davies and Brook (after the two streets near Claridge’s), will do well.

It's also important to remember that British people are also opening restaurants in America. Will Beckett and Huw Gott, who own the popular Hawksmoor restaurants, are opening a steakhouse in New York in March. This is a very brave thing to do because New York is famous for good steaks. It will be interesting to see what New Yorkers think of the British way of making steak.

Next year, politicians will have one last chance to try to stop the climate problems that are threatening the world. On November 9th, people will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow. They will try to agree on ways to reduce carbon emissions. This could help keep the rise in world temperature below 2 degrees Celsius. Scientists have said that the world is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than before factories were invented. They also say that the temperature could rise by 3 or 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. If this happens, there will be more strong storms, rising sea levels, deserts spreading, crops failing, and very hot weather. These things would be dangerous for people all over the world.

During most of 2020, people will try to prepare for the Glasgow talks. They want countries to promise to reduce their carbon emissions a lot. They also want to find a way for richer and poorer countries to work together to fight the climate problems. Poorer countries say that richer countries are mostly responsible for the carbon emissions so far. They say that richer countries are still not doing enough to reduce emissions now. They also want rich countries to give at least $100 billion each year to help them deal with the problems caused by global warming and to cut their own emissions. So far, these different groups have not been able to agree on how to do this."
5,5_2,2,"Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously – threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future.

Claire Perry O’Neill As president of COP26, it will be the principal job of the former Tory MP to ensure the talks are successful. Politics The UK’s membership of the European Union will be terminated at the end of January, but that’s not Brexit done. We then enter a transition period while there are tough and complex negotiations about the future relationship with our closest neighbours and most important trading partners. Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters. There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020. The SNP will demand it, but without any real conviction that it can get one from a Conservative government that has set an adamantine face against the idea. This refusal will suit the Nationalists.","Greenland's ice is melting much faster than before. It is melting seven times faster than it was in the 1990s. Also, the west Antarctic ice sheet is now becoming unstable, which is very worrying. This could cause sea levels to rise a lot, which would be very bad for countries like Bangladesh and islands in the Pacific Ocean in the future.

The temperature in Australia reached record high levels, which caused big bushfires all over the country. In Africa, the Victoria Falls, which is a very famous waterfall, almost dried up in 2019. The climate talks in Glasgow will happen with all these worrying things happening in the world.

Here are some people to watch:

*   **Greta Thunberg:** Can she keep the climate protest movement going strong?
*   **Donald Trump:** He is taking the US out of international climate agreements by November 4, 2020. But if he loses the election next year on November 3, and a Democrat wins, the US could join the talks again in 2021.
*   **Claire Perry O’Neill:** She is in charge of the COP26 talks, so her main job is to make sure the talks are successful. She used to be a Member of Parliament.

**Politics**

The UK will leave the European Union at the end of January, but that is not the end of Brexit. After that, there will be a period where the UK and the EU will negotiate a new agreement about their future relationship. These talks will be difficult because the EU is the UK's closest neighbour and most important trading partner.

Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, says he can get a trade deal with the EU that has no taxes and no limits on the amount of goods traded. He says he can do this without having to follow the same rules as the EU. But the EU says they will not agree to this.

Boris Johnson has also said that if there is no agreement by the end of the year, the UK will leave the EU without a deal. This means there would be problems with trade and other things. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially for the factories and the people who voted for him in the Midlands and the north of England?

By the end of the year, either he will have to back down, or he will disappoint those new voters.

There will not be another vote about Scotland becoming independent in 2020. The Scottish National Party (SNP) will ask for it, but they don't really think they will get permission from the Conservative government, which is against the idea. This refusal will actually help the SNP."
5,5_3,3,"Current polling suggests that they can’t be confident of winning a referendum now, and a second defeat would surely kill their ambition for a long time. The SNP’s true aim is to stoke Scottish resentment against Westminster to pave the way for a big win in the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That’s the year with the potential for a constitutional car crash that rips apart the kingdom. Both the Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the latter contest, which is expected to climax around March. Expect bitter rows about the election process as the Corbynites who control the party’s national executive committee try to fix the terms of the battle to favour their continuity candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey. Labour moderates are already saying that the succession of a beardless variation of Jeremy Corbyn will doom Labour to another decade in opposition. If that happens, the moderates will be asking whether the party is dead to them and they should try something different.

If they lose a second time, it would stop their plans for a long time. The SNP really wants to make Scottish people angry with the government in London. They want to win the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That year could be a big problem for the UK and break it apart.

The Liberal Democrats and the Labour party will choose new leaders. Most people will watch the Labour party election, which should finish around March. There will probably be big arguments about how the election is done. People who support Corbyn and control the party will try to make the rules help their candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey. Some people in the Labour party who don't agree with Corbyn say that if someone like him becomes leader again, Labour will lose for another ten years. If that happens, they will wonder if the party is finished for them and if they should try something else.

Here are three people to watch:

*   **Boris Johnson:** He has promised many things about Brexit, the NHS, and giving money to the north of England. Can he do what he promised, or will things start to go wrong for him in 2020?

*   **Nicola Sturgeon:** After winning a lot of seats in Scotland in the December 2019 election, everyone will be watching the leader of the SNP. They will see how she uses her popularity to try to get Scotland to become independent.

*   **Rebecca Long Bailey:** She has a difficult fight to become the leader of the Labour party. Many people want the job. Will the members choose someone who is like Corbyn, or will they want someone new for the party?

The Queen, who will be 94 in April, looks increasingly alone as the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 99 in June, leads a near solitary life on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew’s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein’s alleged victims’ lawyers’ relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, meanwhile, are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold and risky strategy in taking on the press over privacy. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter to her estranged father.","Here are some people to watch out for:

**Johnny Flynn:** You may know Johnny Flynn from the TV shows *Les Miserables* and *Vanity Fair* in 2018. He will be in some important movies this year. He plays David Bowie in the movie *Stardust*. He is also in a movie based on Jane Austen's book, *Emma*, where he has blond hair! Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart are also in this movie. Another British movie called *The Dig*, which is about someone who studies old objects from the ground, will also be in cinemas soon with him in it.

And if she does, will she listen to their requests?

**Adele:** People are talking a lot about when Adele will release her fourth album (maybe called *30*?). The excitement will probably increase a lot after she has had a few difficult years away from being famous.

**The Royal Family:** After a difficult year, the royal family will have a challenging year in 2020 to keep the monarchy strong. The Queen will be 94 in April. It seems she is more and more alone because the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 99 in June, mostly lives by himself on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Some decisions made by members of the family have made people wonder if the Queen is always asked before others do things that they want to do. Prince Andrew's surprising TV interview with Emily Maitlis on the show *Newsnight* made Pizza Express in Woking famous and made everyone search on the internet for medical reasons why people don't sweat.

6,6_0,0,"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England who is leaving soon, has said that all companies and banks need to explain why they are still investing in fossil fuels like oil and gas. He warned that these investments could become “worthless” in the future.

In an interview on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Carney said that banks are starting to invest less in oil and gas companies, but it is not happening fast enough.

Carney will soon start a new job as a special representative for climate change and finance at the United Nations. He agreed to be on the programme which was organized by Greta Thunberg, who is a climate change activist. She was one of the guest editors on the Today programme for the holidays.

Carney has been one of the most outspoken bank governors about the need for banks to do more to help the world move towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis is a “tragedy that is coming” and that more extreme weather events will happen.

He said that ""by the time that these extreme events happen often and are very clear, it will be too late to do anything about it.” He also said that political leaders need to ""start dealing with future problems now"".

When asked if investors should stop investing in fossil fuel companies, Carney said that people who manage money will “have to decide and explain to the people whose money it really is”.

When asked if pension funds should stop investing in oil and gas companies even if they make a lot of money, he said: “Well, that has not happened, but they could argue that. They need to explain why that would be the case if a large part of those investments are going to be worthless.”

He warned: “If we burn all of the oil and gas, we will not be able to meet our goals for reducing carbon. Up to 80% of coal investments will be lost, and up to half of the oil reserves in developed countries. So every company, every bank, every investment manager, pension fund and insurance company needs to answer the question: what is your plan?”

The Bank of England has said that investments worth up to $20 trillion could quickly become worthless if banks and businesses do not smoothly move towards a zero-carbon economy."

Complaining about how much internal opposition there had been to this item being included, Moore accused the BBC of “climate change alarmism”.","In his interview, Carney asked people who don't believe in climate change to stop disagreeing about it. He said, ""We need to be honest about this issue and not use only some information or try to trick people."" One person who doesn't fully believe in climate change is Charles Moore. He used to be the editor of the Daily Telegraph. He was in charge of the ""Today"" program on Saturday. In his program, he talked about whether most people around the world really agree about the climate crisis. Moore complained that many people at the BBC didn't want him to include this part in the program. He said the BBC was making people too worried about climate change."

Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.","A man who was killed in the center of Moscow after shooting at the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia's main intelligence agency, has been named. The attack killed two people. The man has been identified as someone who really liked guns.

The investigators said his name was Yevgeny Manyurov. He was 39 years old and from Podolsk. Podolsk is a small town about 30 miles south of Moscow.

On Thursday evening, Manyurov started shooting with a gun. He was using an automatic weapon and fired bullets at the windows of the FSB headquarters in Lubyanka from the street. One FSB employee was killed. On Friday evening, a second FSB officer died in the hospital because of his injuries. Another FSB officer was badly hurt. Three other people were also hurt, including one person who was not working for the FSB.

Officials said that Manyurov was then shot and killed by an FSB sniper. Officers found some grenades and a homemade bomb in a bag he was carrying.

Security officials said that Manyurov did not get inside the Lubyanka building. This building used to be the main offices of the KGB, which was the secret police in the Soviet times.

Russian news has described the gunman as someone who lived alone with his mother and was very interested in guns. He didn't have a job, but he used to work as a security guard. He even worked at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian news.

Recently, Manyurov came third in a shooting competition. This competition was organized by a sports group that was like the military. This group was started again by Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, in 2009.

Police took away a lot of weapons from his home that he owned legally. This included two rifles that could fire automatically and two shotguns. It is said that he used a Kalashnikov rifle during the attack on Thursday.

Oleg Solovich was an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practiced. Solovich said that Manyurov was not a good shooter. He used to come to the shooting range wearing a long black coat with a hood. Solovich told the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, ""We told him to take off his coat when he was shooting, but he said he felt comfortable wearing it."""
7,7_1,1,"The motive for the attack remains unclear, although Kommersant, a daily newspaper, reported that witnesses told investigators he was shouting slogans “typical of Islamic State”. “I noticed he had been somewhat agitated lately,” Baza, a media outlet with links to the security services, cited his mother as saying. She said he was unmarried, with no children or close friends, and that he was passionate about guns. He appears to have had no social media presence. The assault on the FSB office took place shortly after Putin’s annual press conference in Moscow. The president was attending a gala concert at the nearby Kremlin in honour of the security services during the shootout. The attack may have been planned to coincide with the speech, an FSB source told Reuters. Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process.","We still don't know why the attack happened. However, the newspaper Kommersant said that people who saw it told investigators that the attacker was shouting things that sounded like they came from the Islamic State. Baza, a news website that is connected to the security services, quoted the attacker's mother. She said, ""I saw that he was a bit worried recently."" She also said that he was not married, did not have any children or close friends, and that he really liked guns. It seems he didn't use social media. The attack on the FSB office happened soon after Putin finished his yearly press conference in Moscow. While the shooting was happening, the president was at a special concert in the Kremlin, which is close by. The concert was to celebrate the security services. Someone from the FSB told Reuters that the attack might have been planned to happen at the same time as Putin's speech. Meduza, a news website that is not controlled by the government, said that police might have kept shooting for a while after Manyurov was killed. They might have hurt someone who was walking by."
8,8_0,0,"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries. A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration.","In Austria, the Green party is very close to being part of the government for the first time. This is because the Green party and the conservative party of Sebastian Kurz have agreed on a plan to work together. Kurz used to be the chancellor and will probably be again.

The Greens will be the smaller partner in the government with Kurz’s Austrian People’s party (ÖVP). They will replace the far-right Freedom party. The Freedom party’s leaders had to leave because of a big problem called the “Ibiza affair,” which was about corruption. Because of this, people didn't vote for them in the next elections.

In the September elections, Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens did very well. The ÖVP got the most votes with 37%, and the Greens had their best result ever. After talking for many months, the parties made an agreement on Saturday. Kurz told reporters that he was hopeful they could form a government with the Greens. The leader of the Green party, Werner Kogler, said they had solved some problems that seemed impossible to solve. He will probably become the deputy chancellor.

If the Green party's members agree to the plan this Saturday, the president of Austria, Alexander Van der Bellen, could create a new government as early as January 7th.

Other countries near Austria will be watching this new government closely. In Switzerland, the Greens did very well in the elections in October. They want to change how power is shared in Switzerland so that the Green party has more say. In Germany, Angela Merkel's CDU party and the Green party are popular. The next elections in Germany are in autumn 2021.

The German newspaper Die Welt wrote that something is happening in Austria that people in Germany can only dream of. They said it is a new beginning in politics, led by two parties that are in favor of Europe and did well in the recent elections.

It is likely that Kurz will have a lot of power in the new government because his party won by a large amount in September. The ÖVP will probably keep the important jobs of chancellor and finance minister. They will also likely control the ministries for the interior, foreign affairs, and defense. A new ministry for integration might be created so that Kurz can continue his strict rules on immigration."

The Green party will aim to exercise the most influence through a boosted ministry for infrastructure, transport and environment, expected to be headed by the former climate activist Leonore Gewessler. Green politicians in charge of the justice and culture portfolios will hope to curb the more authoritarian tendencies of Kurz’s ÖVP. In the final stretch of negotiations, Austria’s constitutional court ruled that some of the policies proposed by the conservatives – such as expanded surveillance measures or making social benefits conditional on command of the German language – would violate the constitution. “The Greens’ main aim [during coalition talks] has been to get major concessions on protecting the climate,” said Der Standard newspaper, commenting that the deal with the conservatives was as likely to please environmentalists as to frustrate leftwingers in the party. “With everything else, damage limitation will have to do.”","Susanne Raab, someone he trusts a lot, will be in charge of it. She helped with the ban on face coverings in 2017. She also worked on a law from 2015 that tried to limit “political Islam”.

The Green party wants to have the most power through a bigger ministry. This ministry will be for things like roads, trains, and protecting nature. Leonore Gewessler, who used to fight for the climate, is likely to lead this ministry.

Green politicians who are in charge of justice and culture hope to stop Kurz’s ÖVP party from becoming too strict.

Near the end of talks, Austria’s top court said that some of the things the conservatives wanted to do were against the rules. For example, they wanted to watch people more and make social help depend on how well someone spoke German. The court said these things were not allowed by the constitution.

The Der Standard newspaper said, “The Green party’s main goal [during talks] was to get big promises about saving the climate.” They also said that the deal with the conservatives will probably make some environmentalists happy, but other left-wing people in the party unhappy. “For everything else, they will have to try and limit the bad effects.”"
9,9_0,0,"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes. CGT union workers also voted to halt production at Total’s Grandpuits refinery.","French train workers who are on strike had some problems with the police in Paris. This happened after they had a protest against changes to their pensions. This was even though the French President, Emmanuel Macron, asked them to stop the strike for Christmas.

On Monday morning, many workers and people from unions gathered outside the Gare de Lyon train station. This station is used by many people who are travelling south for the holidays or to go skiing near the Alps. Many trains from this station have been cancelled. Some of the striking workers gave speeches. They said they didn't agree with the government's plan to change the pension system. They also said they would keep striking over Christmas and into the new year.

The people protesting set off flares and fireworks. The smoke went into the station. Police officers wearing helmets and shields stood at the ticket gates.

The train strikes have been happening all over the country for 19 days. The train company, SNCF, said that the strikes are causing ""big problems"" with the trains. Most of the unions and train workers did not listen to the President's request to stop for Christmas. People waited in lines at the ticket offices to try and get seats on the few trains that were running. Some trains were stopped before they reached their final stop, and some trains were replaced with buses.

About 48% of people with tickets for fast trains and long-distance trains had their trains cancelled on December 23rd and 24th. This made many people try to find car-sharing or rent a car at the last minute. There were also big problems with the Paris underground and local trains around Paris. Many people gathered at the Gare du Nord train station to take the smaller number of trains to the suburbs.

Some people who were trying to get to airports near Paris said that it was hard to find taxis. Some taxi drivers were charging more money than usual because there was a lot of traffic on the roads around Paris. Other people were worried about how they would get back home after the Christmas holidays, because the strikes are planned to continue into January.

At the same time, the Lavera oil refinery in the south of France stopped working. This refinery processes 210,000 barrels of oil each day. Workers from the CGT union voted to stop the oil production as part of the protests against the pension changes. Workers from the CGT union also voted to stop production at Total's Grandpuits refinery."
9,9_1,1,"Emmanuel Lepine, the secretary general of the CGT’s oil branch, told France Info radio that CGT workers at other refineries in France could also vote to halt production. “We gave an ultimatum to the government, it didn’t listen, so we’re doing exactly what we promised,” Lepine said. “What we are demanding is the withdrawal of the reform.” State officials have begun preparing for another round of union negotiations in the coming weeks before a further national day of protests on 9 January. The government has insisted it will push ahead with attempts to unify the French pension system, arguing that removing 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Opéra de Paris staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any age-related changes. Unions are angry at government plans to introduce a “pivot age” – keeping the legal retirement age at 62 but insisting on an additional two years of work to receive a full pension.","Emmanuel Lepine, who is in charge of the oil section of the CGT union, said on France Info radio that workers at other oil factories in France might also decide to stop working. ""We told the government what would happen if they didn't listen, and they didn't. So, we are doing what we said we would,"" Lepine explained. ""We want the government to stop the new rules.""

Government workers are getting ready for more talks with the unions in the next few weeks. This will happen before another big protest on January 9th. The government says it will continue trying to make the French pension system the same for everyone. They say that getting rid of the 42 different rules for different jobs, like train and energy workers, lawyers, and people who work at the Opéra de Paris, is very important. They believe it will help the pension system have enough money as people live longer.

Some unions agree that a single system is a good idea. However, almost all of them don't want any changes to the age people can retire. The unions are angry about the government's plan to introduce a ""pivot age."" This means that people can still retire at 62, but they will have to work for two more years to get their full pension money."

You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick.

This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget – one that has seen more than 1.7 million people killed and 82 million infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, whose pyrotechnic display has in the past drawn crowds of a million people to the city’s harbour area, rang in 2021 with a shortened display, with most popular observation spots fenced off and a heavy police presence deterring visitors. Only people who had restaurant reservations or were one of five guests of an inner-city resident were allowed in. “What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands gathered at popular spots across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but were not particularly worried. In New Zealand, too, which has managed to eliminate coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year’s Eve plans proceeded as usual.

This New Year's Eve is different from any other. Many people are saying goodbye to a year they want to forget. In 2020, more than 1.7 million people died and 82 million people got the coronavirus since January.

Sydney usually has a big fireworks show that brings a million people to the harbour. This year, the show was shorter. Most of the popular places to watch were closed off, and there were many police to stop people from coming. Only people who had booked a table at a restaurant or were visiting someone who lived in the city were allowed in.

Gladys Berejiklian, who is in charge of New South Wales, said, ""What a terrible year it has been! Hopefully 2021 will be better for everyone.""

In Wuhan, a city in China where the virus started a year ago, thousands of people met in the city centre to celebrate the start of 2021. Some people said they were being careful, but they weren't too worried.

In New Zealand, they have stopped the coronavirus after a strong lockdown that lasted seven weeks. Their New Year's Eve celebrations went ahead as normal.

But in Germany, you couldn't buy fireworks because they didn't want people to gather in crowds. The police in Berlin said they would punish anyone who broke the rules. Angela Merkel, who is the leader of Germany, said in her last New Year's speech that she had never felt the past year so difficult. This was her 16th and final New Year's speech as chancellor."
11,11_1,1,"“And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope,” said Merkel, a trained physicist who won praise for taming the first virus wave but has drawn criticism for soaring infection and death numbers in the second. She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve.","""We have never looked forward to a new year with so much hope, even though we have worries and some doubts,"" said Merkel. She is a trained scientist and people praised her for controlling the first wave of the virus. However, she has also been criticised because the number of infections and deaths has increased in the second wave. She spoke strongly against people protesting against lockdowns and those who believe in conspiracy theories about vaccines. ""I can only imagine how sad it must be for those who are grieving for people who have died from the virus, or for those who are fighting the after-effects of the illness, when some people are saying the virus isn't real,"" Merkel said.

The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he thought the country would have the ""quietest New Year's Eve"" that anyone can remember.

In France, no more than six adults can meet for dinner. There will be 100,000 police officers making sure people follow the rules. Alcohol shops were closed in some places. The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, told police officers to make sure everyone followed the national curfew from 8 pm to 6 am. This was part of a ""fight against illegal public meetings and violence in cities.""

In Britain, there were 964 deaths on Thursday because of a new type of Covid. People who were planning to celebrate New Year's Eve were told they should wait until later in 2021 to have parties because ""Covid likes crowds.""

Professor Stephen Powis, who is the head doctor for NHS England, said that staying at home and celebrating 2021 ""following the rules"" would reduce the number of people getting infected and help the hospitals. ""It is very important that everyone continues to follow the advice by staying at home and not mixing with other people,"" he said.

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, also asked people to follow the rules and ""celebrate the new year safely at home."" Barriers were put up in public places like Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square in London.

In Italy, the country in Europe with the most deaths from Covid-19, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed. There was also a curfew from 10 am to 7 pm for New Year's Eve."
11,11_2,2,"Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility. In New York, the New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway but in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said.","Pope Francis was not able to lead the New Year's Eve and New Year's Day church services. The Vatican said this was because his sciatica, a problem with his leg, was causing him pain again.

Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, spoke on Thursday in his New Year's speech. He said he hoped the people of Russia would work together as the country fights the virus. He knew that a second wave of the virus was still causing problems. “Sadly, the virus is not completely gone yet,” Putin said. His speech was shown just before midnight in each of the 11 different time zones in Russia. He also said, “The fight against the virus doesn’t stop, even for a minute."" He added that many doctors and nurses would be “working hard on this holiday night,"" and he asked everyone to be responsible.

In New York, the New Year's Eve ball will still come down in Broadway. But instead of having hundreds of thousands of people standing close together in Times Square, only a small group of special people will be there. These people will be nurses, doctors, and other important workers. Their families will also be there, but they will stay apart from each other, with enough space between them.

The police are worried about the virus spreading, so they closed Times Square to cars and people on Wednesday at midnight. They said they would ask anyone who came into the area around the ball to leave. This area usually has many people standing very close together to watch the ball drop. “If you think you can just stand there and watch the ball, you are wrong,” said police chief Terence Monahan."
12,12_0,0,"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","This year has been difficult for a lot of people. It has also been a hard year for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India. When the pandemic started in March, the country had a very strict lockdown. The many elephants at the sanctuary could not go for their long walks anymore. These walks were about 30 miles every day, and they were very important for the elephants to stretch their legs and help them digest their food.

The elephants started to have health problems. This was made worse because everyone at the sanctuary, including the humans and the animals, felt sad. Ankit Pareek, who is in charge of the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could feel that the humans were stressed and worried. Many elephants became sad because they were not getting exercise and fun from the tourists anymore. The tourists used to walk with them, wash them, play with them, and take nice photos with them. We were very worried about the elephants.”

But Pareek had even bigger worries. He needed the money from tourists to take care of the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of food, up to 200 kg each day. This is about 10% of their body weight. It costs up to 5,000 rupees (£51) every day for each elephant. “We did not want the elephants to suffer. They deserve only love and respect. So, we have borrowed money to pay for their food,” said Pareek. He has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if tourists from other countries do not come back soon, it will be very bad for us.”

People who care about animal rights have said for a long time that training elephants to carry tourists is cruel and bad. In countries like India and Thailand, elephant tourism is usually a big and successful business. But now that there are no tourists, there is a new problem with how the animals are treated. However, animal rights activists hope that this break will finally stop the exploitation of animals for tourism.

In September, four elephants that were trained to give tourists rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found that they had been tied up all day for months, with not enough food and water because of the pandemic. This caused them to have serious health problems and die. Varda Mehrotra, the director of FIAPO, said: “For many years, we have been showing how bad the conditions are for elephants in India that are kept by people."""
12,12_1,1,"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","Covid has made all the problems we have talked about for years much worse, and now elephants are dying.” Mehrotra said that a big problem is that there are only about eight elephant places to keep them safe in India. Most of these places are not big enough to take care of the elephants that are now ""out of work"" and hungry. Many of the 1,800 elephants in India that people own make money by being part of Hindu festivals, called pujas, or in wedding parades. But these events are not happening because of Covid rules. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave some money to elephant owners when everything was closed, but they don't give money anymore. Other states did not give any money at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, who is 37, has two elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, that are 40 years old. His family in Tamil Nadu owns them. He is using videos on social media and a website where people can give money to try to help his elephants and other elephants that are having problems. He said, “I am very worried about elephants all over India. Nobody wants to say that they are having a hard time taking care of their elephants and need money because they are worried that people will be angry with them.” In Thailand, 2,000 elephants have been kept in tourist camps. Now, people are leaving these elephants because they can’t take care of them. The government helped a little by giving out grass and hay, but some camps had to close. Then, many elephants left the camps in Thailand. About 1,000 elephants walked for days back to the villages where their handlers lived, which were often also the places where the elephants were born. They had not been to these places for many years. In March, three elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked if he could stay at Sangdeaun’s place for a short time. But in the morning, he was gone. Later, he called and said that he did not have enough money to take care of the elephants. Sangdeaun said, “It’s like when people bring their dog to the animal doctor and then leave it there. I thought this would only happen with a dog or cat. But now they are leaving elephants with us.”"
12,12_2,2,"Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, the president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said the number of callers asking for veterinary assistance had grown since March. Patitta Traiwet, the president of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has branches across Thailand, said she had managed to maintain the animals’ routine but the elephants had noticed the absence of tourists lining up to give them bananas and pineapples. “They were confused at the beginning – where are the people? Why is nobody feeding me banana?” she said. Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth. Many people now hope that even when the tourists return, these elephants will remain resettled in their natural habitat for good. Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol","Sangdeaun's centre has 97 elephants. Most of them are old and have finished working. They were saved from camps where people used to ride on them. Because of the problems happening now, the price of elephants in Thailand has gone down a lot, according to Sangdeaun. Before, a baby elephant could cost $100,000. Now, you can buy the same elephant for only $40,000.

She is worried that families who have taken care of elephants for many years will not be able to keep them anymore. She thinks they might sell them cheaply to big companies. For the elephants still in camps in Thailand, life is hard. They are often kept in chains for a long time. Sangdeaun said, ""They feel sad and angry, and they fight with each other."" Some camps have fewer mahouts (elephant keepers) now, so the elephants are not getting as much care.

Theerapat Trungprakan, who is the head of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said that more people have been calling for help from vets since March. Patitta Traiwet, who is in charge of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has places all over Thailand, said that she is still doing the same things for the animals every day. But the elephants have noticed that there are no tourists giving them bananas and pineapples. She said, ""At first, they were confused. They wondered where the people were and why nobody was giving them bananas.""

However, for the hundreds of elephants that have gone back home with their mahouts, the coronavirus problem might be a good thing. They can now play in the jungles and rivers where they were born. Many people hope that even when the tourists come back, these elephants will stay in their natural home forever. This story also includes information from Navaon Siradapuvadol."
13,13_0,0,"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","It seems that the new UK version of the Covid-19 virus, which spreads quickly, is easier to pass on. A new study shows this might be because people with this version have more of the virus in their bodies.

This new version is called B117. Scientists found it when they were checking why the number of coronavirus cases in Kent kept going up in November when everyone was staying home. They saw that it continued to spread even when people were following the rules, while older versions of the virus were going down.

Some big testing centers that were set up in April in cities like London and Manchester started seeing the new version in people's tests. Then, a group of scientists called Covid-19 Genomics UK warned everyone about B117 and said it was easier to pass on.

Dr. Michael Kidd, from the Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team looked at 641 tests from people who had Covid-19 symptoms. They found B117 along with other versions of the virus. They found that around 35% of people with B117 had a lot of the virus in their samples. This was compared to only 10% of people who had other versions. This study has not yet been checked by other scientists.

Dr. Kidd said that it looks like people with this version of the virus have more of it in their bodies. He said that if this is true, it would be easier for them to give it to others. However, he also said that this is just early information and they need more proof before they can be sure.

Scientists are quite sure that B117 is easier to pass on. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says that it spreads about 56% faster than older versions.

There are many reasons why it might spread more easily. Maybe people only need a small amount of the virus in their body to pass it on. Or, maybe the virus grows faster in people's throats and noses. It could also be that people are contagious for a longer time, which makes it more likely that they will give the virus to someone else.

Dr. Kidd also said that they don't know exactly how the virus reaches such high levels in people's bodies. He said they need to do tests in a lab to understand why this version of the virus is easier to pass on."
13,13_1,1,"“Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death. But a higher rate of transmissibility without strict controls could still lead to more death. • This article was corrected on 30 December 2020. The higher viral load was found in respiratory samples, not blood samples as an earlier version stated.","We need more information, like pieces in a puzzle. I think this study is important, even though it is just a first look and needs to be done again. It gives us an idea of why this virus might spread more easily. This is because people with the virus might be more likely to infect others. Early information says that the UK version of the virus does not seem to make people more ill or make it more likely they will get the virus again or die. But, if the virus spreads more easily and we don't have strong rules, more people could still die. • This article was changed on December 30, 2020. The larger amount of virus was found in samples from people's breathing, not from blood samples, as we said before."
14,14_0,0,"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Doctors are worried that hospitals might soon have to make very difficult decisions about which patients with Covid get important treatment that could save their lives. This is because the NHS is under a lot of pressure and finding it hard to cope.

This warning happened at the same time as more and more people asked for the whole UK to go into another lockdown. People also suggested that schools should start later after the Christmas holidays, maybe even a month later. This would help to stop the big increase in coronavirus infections.

The health service is having problems dealing with a record number of Covid cases. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said that some patients might not be able to get a place in the intensive care unit or have the chance to use a breathing machine. This was said on Tuesday.

Many people are asking the government to take stronger actions against Covid. Matt Hancock is going to tell Members of Parliament on Wednesday how well the system of tiers (different levels of rules) is working in England to stop the virus from spreading again.

The Health Secretary might say that a new tier 5 will be created in England. This would be even stricter than tier 4, which is what London and much of the south of England are in now. He might also put areas that are in tier 3 into tier 4 to try to stop the infections from rising quickly. On Tuesday, the number of new infections reached a record high of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system.

More and more hospitals are getting close to being unable to cope with the number of patients who need emergency care because of Covid. To show how serious the situation is, some ICUs in London (which is the worst affected part of England again) are so full that doctors have asked for some patients to be moved hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire. This is to help them get a bed and reduce the pressure on the hospitals in London, according to the Health Service Journal.

Another example is the Royal Free hospital in London. They are planning to move the children's ward to another hospital. This will give them more space for adults who are sick with Covid and other illnesses. They have also decided to use the admissions unit at Barnet General Hospital, which they also run, as extra space for Covid patients. Staff were told this in an email on Tuesday."
14,14_1,1,"A senior manager at the trust, which now has 424 inpatients with Covid, said: “London Gold call has indicated that this position is expected to escalate for the next two weeks with 4 January potentially the zenith of critical care capacity needed.” The Independent Sage committee of scientific and medical experts is urging ministers to instigate an immediate further UK-wide lockdown to try to prevent an imminent “catastrophe”. Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action. Referring to the Tiers review, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: “It will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people to the highest level.” A toughening is needed urgently because pressures on the NHS in some places is “rising at an unsustainable rate”, she said. Keir Starmer sounded a stark warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian that the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January. Dr Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS and president of the HCSA, said ICU staff may end up having to in effect ration who received care that could help them survive. “Our NHS just doesn’t have the beds to cope. Some areas will be overwhelmed in days. If ventilation capacity is exceeded, horrendous choices will have to be made over those who live and die.","A senior manager at the hospital trust, which now has 424 patients in the hospital with Covid, said: “The London Gold group has told us that the situation is likely to get worse for the next two weeks. They think that January 4th could be the worst day, when we need the most beds for very sick patients.”

The Independent Sage committee, which is made up of scientists and doctors, is asking the government to start another lockdown across the whole of the UK right away. They want to do this to stop a ""terrible disaster"" from happening soon. They said that if we wait any longer, tens of thousands of people will die who could have been saved.

The committee is led by Sir David King, who used to be the government's top scientist. They also said that schools should stay closed until the beginning of February. They think that opening them next week as planned could make the already bad situation even worse. This is especially because there is a new type of the virus that spreads more easily and seems to infect people under 18 more easily.

Christina Pagel, who is a member of Independent Sage and a professor at University College London, said: ""Things are as bad as they have ever been. What's scary is that they are going to get even worse. We need to act now to stop the NHS from collapsing in a few weeks. It's that serious.""

NHS Providers, which speaks for hospital trusts in England, also asked for stronger action. Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, talked about the review of the different levels of restrictions. She said: ""We will need to make difficult decisions and move millions more people to the highest level."" She said that we need to make the rules tougher quickly because the NHS in some areas is under pressure that is ""increasing too fast.""

Keir Starmer gave a serious warning about the problems that the NHS and schools will face next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian newspaper that the UK was ""facing"" a third lockdown in January.

Dr Claudia Paoloni, who is a doctor in the NHS and president of the HCSA, said that staff in intensive care units might have to decide who gets the treatment that could help them live. ""Our NHS simply doesn't have enough beds to cope,"" she said. ""Some areas will be full within days. If we run out of machines to help people breathe, we will have to make awful choices about who lives and who dies."""
14,14_2,2,"“The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days.","She explained that doctors will have to make difficult choices, such as: deciding which patients should go to intensive care and which patients can only have basic care, without intensive care. They also have to decide how long to continue giving very strong treatments to someone who isn't getting much better, especially when another person arrives in intensive care and needs a machine to clean their blood, but there are only a few of these machines. Another hard decision is who gets a bed in intensive care or a breathing machine if all the beds and machines are being used.

Paoloni also said that hospitals might have to stop giving care for other illnesses, even things like cancer surgery. This is despite what NHS England said about trying to continue these treatments during the second wave. A hospital might have to ask itself, ""Can we do the cancer surgery today or not? We only have a few beds and no spare intensive care beds for emergencies if we use the last bed for a big cancer operation.""

She added that checking for illnesses like cancer might have to stop, and people might have to wait longer for an ambulance to arrive after calling 999.

The NHS is facing the biggest emergency in its 72-year history. Because of this, some hospitals are thinking about putting up tents outside to sort patients into groups based on how sick they are. This is because there are long lines of ambulances outside many emergency rooms. These ambulances have patients who sometimes wait for hours inside before they can be admitted to the hospital.

On Tuesday, ambulances were seen waiting in lines outside hospitals such as the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, Queen’s Hospital in Romford (both in east London), and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

Dr Simon Walsh, a consultant in the emergency room and deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, said the tent idea is usually used after a big event, like a terrorist attack or a big accident at a factory. He said that NHS staff are getting ready for ""more and more people being admitted"" with Covid in the next few weeks, because the number of infections is still going up quickly.

Walsh asked the government to create a plan to deal with the growing problems in the health service. The Doctors’ Association UK said that Covid has caused ""a huge increase"" in the pressure on the NHS in recent days."

15,15_0,0,"Throughout the pandemic, technology has been saving our jobs and our sanity – but in Barcelona the lockdowns have led to the revival of one of humanity’s simplest and most enduring inventions: the book. The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango.","During the pandemic, technology has helped us keep our jobs and stay calm. But in Barcelona, the lockdowns have also brought back something very old and important: the book. Bookshops in the city are selling more books than before, and surprisingly, new bookshops are opening.

One of the newest bookshops is called Llibreria Byron. It was started by Huygens, a small company that publishes books for schools and universities. The bookshop opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of Barcelona.

Mariana Sarrias, who owns the bookshop with someone else, said, “We planned to open three years ago, and we wanted to open in April. But we couldn't because of the situation.” She added, “After nine months of not knowing what would happen, and with all the money we had put into the business, we were very worried.” They chose the name Byron “because he was a romantic person and also a bit rebellious.”

“On the day we finally opened in November, people were waiting in line to get in. There wasn't enough space for everyone. It was very emotional. Since then, people come every day. I don’t know if it’s because they want to support us or because the area needed a bookshop,” she said.

Maria Carme Ferrer, who is in charge of the booksellers’ association in Catalonia, said, “The pandemic has made people understand that they need to help their local bookshop. Bookshops are important cultural places in the community.”

Sarrias also said that as publishers, they noticed more people were ordering books during the lockdown. “Maybe people got tired of watching Netflix,” she said. Or maybe, because they had to stay at home, people realized that books are good to have around.

It wasn't long ago that the book business seemed like it was going to fail. In 2013, the Catalonia bookshop, which was very popular with readers in the city since 1924, had to close. A McDonald’s restaurant opened in its place. In the same year, Canuda, a big secondhand bookshop that inspired the ""cemetery of forgotten books"" in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s popular book, The Shadow of the Wind, also closed. Now, it is a shop for the fashion company Mango."
15,15_1,1,"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","Maybe this sudden return to reading is not surprising. This city is the main place for Spanish book publishing. Also, people in Catalonia show their love for books every year on April 23rd. This is the day of their special saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and it is also Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day, people give each other books and roses. The streets are full of small, temporary book shops.

This year, because of the pandemic, Sant Jordi was basically cancelled. Lluís Morral, who runs Laie, which is probably the most popular bookshop in the city, thinks that it will be small again in 2021.

Morral says that book sales have gone up during the lockdown. People are buying more classic books instead of the newest bestsellers. “Many people have started reading again. They are not looking for the newest books, but are reading books they wanted to read a few years ago,” he said. “Many people buy books on Sant Jordi, but they don’t read them. Now they see they have all these books at home and they have started to read them.”

He agrees with Sarrias that being alone has made people realise that books are good friends. “I can’t speak for everyone, but many people I know got tired of watching TV shows,” Morral said.

Laie and Byron are both bookshops with cafes and quiet places to read. These are very helpful places in what is known as the noisiest city in Europe. Two other new bookshops, Ona, which only sells books in Catalan, and Finestres, which will open in the spring, are also planned to be places where people can meet, read, and buy books. Both of these bookshops are supported by local people who give money to good causes. Morral hopes they do well, but he knows that like all small bookshops, they will have a hard time competing with Amazon.

“What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a friendly service and help in understanding what book you have bought and what you might like to read next. We can do this better than a computer program that tells you what to read,” he said."
16,16_0,0,"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said.","The French government is being criticised because some people think they are trying to please people who are against vaccines. This is because new numbers show that only a few hundred people have had a vaccine in the days after the country started its vaccine program.

Health workers said that France is preparing for “a marathon, not a sprint”. This means they are going slowly, partly because many people in France are unsure about the vaccine. A recent survey showed that only about 40% of people in France said they wanted to be vaccinated. This number has gone down since October, when a little more than half of French people said they were happy to have the vaccine. It is said that 77% of people in Britain and 69% in the US are willing to have the vaccine.

France started giving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday. They started with workers and people living in care homes, and those who are more likely to get very sick from the virus. France is the only country that says people must give their written permission after they have been told about possible problems with the vaccine. But in the first three days, less than 100 people were vaccinated. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health officials.

The health ministry has said that the goal is to vaccinate 1 million elderly people and people at risk in January. This means they need to give more than 31,200 vaccines every day.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, said that France is giving vaccines more slowly than other countries. He said this was done on purpose so they could give people information about the vaccine. He said it was not because they did not have enough vaccines or because there were problems getting the vaccines to people.

Véran told French television: “We have the same amount of vaccine as Germany, our neighbour. We have the same goals, and we will have the same results.” He added, “It is taking some time to start… I think it is better to go slowly and carefully than to rush.”

The president, Emmanuel Macron, and his ministers have said that the vaccine will not be required. Officials have also told the public that they will not make a list of people who do not want to have the Covid-19 vaccine. But Macron said that people should listen to “reason and science”. He said, “The vaccine is not required. Trust our scientists and doctors.”"
16,16_1,1,"In his new year address on Thursday, Macron vowed to avoid “unjustifiable delays” to vaccinations but also struck a defensive note, saying he would let “no one play with the safety” of the campaign. Axel Kahn, a leading geneticist and head of the National League Against Cancer, told Europe 1 radio that France’s vaccine strategy was wrong. “It is not suited to a situation that is so dangerous,” he said. Philippe Juvin, head of the casualty ward at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. “As an individual, I would like to be vaccinated to set an example and show people that we don’t die from the vaccine, we die from Covid. And when we don’t die, we can get severe forms of it that are very disabling,” Juvin told CNews television. Opposition leaders said the slowness of the vaccination programme made France the “dunce” of Europe. Damien Abad, leader of the centre-right opposition Les Républicains in the Assemblée Nationale, demanded an urgent meeting with the health minister. In a letter, other opposition critics wrote: “Mass vaccination is the ultimate means of seeing our country emerge from the damaging economic situation caused by the health crisis. Yet France is vaccinating 10,000 times slower than the UK.” They added: “France cannot be one of the last countries to get vaccinated and yet that’s the picture we’re facing today.” Alain Fischer, the government official overseeing France’s vaccination programme, told Europe 1 the country had chosen to prioritise the elderly and vulnerable, as opposed to health professionals, as in other countries. “There is no good or bad choice … These are small details that will seem ridiculous in two or three months,” he said. Critics say this hesitation is feeding conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxer sentiment. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, said the scientific data was clear. “The vaccine is safe and efficient. Like many of my colleagues, I think we should be giving the vaccines quicker in order to control the epidemic more rapidly. At the rate we’re going, we’ll still be in lockdown in 2022,” he tweeted.","In his New Year's speech on Thursday, President Macron promised to avoid ""delays that aren't necessary"" in the vaccination process. But he also defended the plan, saying he wouldn't let ""anyone risk the safety"" of the vaccination campaign.

Axel Kahn, a famous scientist who studies genes and leads the National League Against Cancer, said on Europe 1 radio that France's plan for vaccines was wrong. He said, ""It is not right for a situation that is so dangerous.""

Philippe Juvin, who is in charge of the emergency room at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. He told CNews television, ""I would like to get vaccinated myself to show people that we don't die from the vaccine. We die from Covid. And even if we don't die, we can get very sick and have problems for a long time.""

Opposition leaders said that the slow speed of the vaccination program made France look like the ""slowest student"" in Europe. Damien Abad, who leads the centre-right opposition party Les Républicains in the National Assembly, asked for an urgent meeting with the health minister.

In a letter, other people who disagree with the government wrote: ""Vaccinating many people is the best way to help our country get out of the bad economic situation caused by the health crisis. But France is vaccinating 10,000 times slower than the UK."" They also said: ""France can't be one of the last countries to get vaccinated, but that's what it looks like right now.""

Alain Fischer, the government worker in charge of France's vaccination program, told Europe 1 that the country had decided to give the vaccine to older and weaker people first, instead of health workers, like in other countries. He said, ""There is no right or wrong choice... These are small things that will seem silly in a few months.""

People who disagree say that this hesitation is making conspiracy theories and negative feelings about vaccines worse. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, a specialist in infections at the Bichat hospital in Paris, said that the scientific information is clear. ""The vaccine is safe and it works well. Like many of my colleagues, I think we should give the vaccines faster so we can control the illness more quickly. If we continue at this rate, we will still be in lockdown in 2022,"" he wrote on Twitter."

17,17_0,0,"Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","In Gibraltar, people are checking on the Barbary macaque monkeys every day. They are worried that these famous monkeys might get the coronavirus. Gibraltar, which is a British area, hasn't had many problems with the virus. They have had about 1,500 people with the virus and six people have died.

But countries everywhere are trying to stop the coronavirus. In Gibraltar, the people in charge have another problem: how to protect the only wild monkeys in Europe from the virus. Mark Pizarro, who is the animal doctor looking after the monkeys, said, ""We knew it from the beginning. It makes sense. This virus affects people who are primates, so it could be dangerous for other primates too.""

Earlier this year, the government tried to stop people from getting too close to the monkeys. The monkeys are a popular thing for tourists to see. In August, a new law was made that says it is against the rules to touch or bother the monkeys. There were already rules that said people would have to pay a lot of money if they fed the monkeys.

The government said that monkeys can easily get sick from human diseases. They said that the monkeys have had hepatitis A before. People think the monkeys have lived on the Rock since the time when the Moors were in charge of Spain and Portugal. There is a local story that says that as long as the monkeys are in Gibraltar, it will stay under British control.

Sometimes, the people in charge have done surprising things to protect the monkeys. During World War II, Winston Churchill told people to bring more monkeys from North Africa to Gibraltar because there weren't many left. Now, there are about 220 monkeys.

In the last few months, they tested four monkeys for the coronavirus. All of them died, but from other things, like being hit by cars. The tests showed that they didn't have the virus. This made the government think that the virus is not a big problem for the monkeys.

But in November, people became worried again. Denmark said they would kill more than 15 million minks because they were worried that new changes in the virus found in the minks could stop the vaccines from working well."
17,17_1,1,"The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal. They interact with themselves, they forage naturally, they spend more time grooming each other, there’s less aggression between the macaques,” said Pizarro. “So there is a lot of positive spin from decreased human contact.”","The government of Gibraltar said the news from Denmark was ""very worrying"". This is because it seemed to say that if the monkeys (macaques) got the virus, they could give it to people. They might also pass on changes to the virus that could make the vaccines not work so well.

Mr. Pizarro said that his team of six people had been checking the monkeys every day. They haven't seen many signs that the monkeys are sick. However, their checks have shown that the pandemic – especially because there are fewer tourists – has been good for the monkeys.

""In many ways, they are acting normally again. They play with each other, they look for food naturally, they spend more time cleaning each other, and they don't fight as much,"" said Mr. Pizarro. ""So, the good thing is that there is less contact with people."""
18,18_0,0,"Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy analyst who served three decades in prison for leaking thousands of classified documents to Israel, has arrived in Tel Aviv after being released from parole. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”. The couple are expected to enter several days of quarantine, which is compulsory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of coronavirus.","Jonathan Pollard, who used to work for the US Navy, has arrived in Tel Aviv. He spent thirty years in prison because he gave many secret documents to Israel. He was let out of parole recently.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, welcomed Pollard and his wife, Esther. They were walking down the stairs from a private plane. The Prime Minister's office showed videos of this.

Pollard and his wife are both Orthodox Jews. They took off their face masks and kissed the ground before saying hello to Netanyahu.

Pollard said, ""We are very happy to be home after 35 years."" He was born in the United States, but he became an Israeli citizen while he was in prison. He added, ""We are very proud of this country and its leader.""

Netanyahu then said a Hebrew prayer to thank God for freeing prisoners. After that, he gave Pollard, who is 66 years old, his Israeli ID cards. The Prime Minister said, ""Welcome home.""

Pollard was arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after he tried to get help from the Israeli embassy in Washington, but it didn't work. In 1987, he was given a life sentence in prison.

This event caused problems between the US and Israel, even though they are good friends. Pollard being in prison for so long made the relationship between the two countries difficult.

Netanyahu has been trying to get Pollard released for many years. When Netanyahu was Prime Minister in the late 1990s, Pollard became an Israeli citizen. But earlier attempts to ask US presidents to let Pollard go free did not succeed.

Pollard was released from parole last month. This was one of the things the Trump administration did for Netanyahu's government before leaving office.

In a phone call last month, Netanyahu asked Pollard, ""When are you coming to see us? We are waiting for you.""

Pollard's lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that Pollard's arrival was ""a dream come true after 35 very hard years.""

Pollard and his wife will need to stay in quarantine for a few days. This is required for all Israelis who come back to the country, to stop the coronavirus from spreading."
19,19_0,0,"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that it would be glad to meet the letter’s signatories to discuss reforms. “We know that as a sector we can and must do better,” said chief executive Kate Henderson.","People who are trying to make things better are asking social housing companies to think about people's lives more than making money. This comes after a report in the Observer newspaper about a black woman who became homeless because her neighbours were racist towards her.

Some important people who used to be in charge of social housing, like Lord Victor Adebowale and others, have written a letter to the National Housing Federation. In the letter, they say that social housing companies are not doing enough to protect people who are being racially harassed.

The letter asks for a quick look at the rules for social housing. They want to make sure that people who are being racist are kicked out of their homes, or that the people they are being racist to are given new homes first.

The group wrote the letter after reading about Laura Tate (not her real name). She has been homeless for five years because she had to leave her flat after people threatened to kill her. The company that gave her the flat, London and Quadrant (L&Q), didn't kick out the people who were being racist, even though they were found guilty of being racially abusive. They also didn't help Laura Tate find a new home.

Last week, a judge gave her £31,000 because she took L&Q to court for not taking care of her. The Observer newspaper also wrote about another black woman who had to live in a safe house for two years because she was running away from her abusive ex-boyfriend. L&Q didn't help her find a new home because they said she didn't have enough proof that she was in danger.

Lord Filkin, who works in the government, said that these are not the only cases. He said that the people in charge of social housing have a duty to make sure that people can live in their homes without problems. He thinks they need to do more to make sure this happens.

L&Q, which provides homes for 250,000 people in the south-east of England, has said that they will have someone look at how they deal with abuse cases. This is because of the Observer's report. On their website, they said that they can learn from what happened and that they don't allow any kind of discrimination.

The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that they are happy to meet with the people who wrote the letter to talk about making changes. Kate Henderson, who is in charge of the National Housing Federation, said that they know they can do better."
19,19_1,1,"“Last month we launched our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Insight report, which provided evidence of the change we need to deliver. “This, and our new code of governance, emphasise the importance of housing association boards and staff reflecting the diversity of the communities they serve and ensuring the sector is always working to strengthen relationships with residents.”","Last month, we started showing our new report about Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion. This report gives us proof of the changes we need to make. This report, and our new rules about how we are managed, both show how important it is for housing association boards and the people who work there to be like the people in the areas they help. They need to look like and understand the different people living there. It's also important that the housing sector always tries to make better relationships with the people who live in the houses."

Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him. No doubt the chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten – who was the last British governor of Hong Kong – will be sympathetic. There is also plenty of space for the erection of a memorial near the Chinese embassy in central London.

Now, they have even taken away a statue from the University of Hong Kong that remembered those events (Outcry as memorial to Tiananmen Square victims removed from Hong Kong University, 23 December).

A lot of students were hurt or killed in Tiananmen Square. Because of this, it's important for universities in other countries to make sure people don't forget how brave they were and how they died for what they believed in.

Student groups at universities in the UK, especially those with many students from China, should remember them. They could do this by changing the name of a building or part of a building. Some universities did this after Steve Biko, a black student who fought against apartheid in South Africa, was killed by the government.

For example, Bradford University used to have a bar called the Steve Biko Bar, but it closed in 2005. However, the student union building at Manchester University (which is the biggest in the UK) is still named after him.

Chris Patten, who is in charge of Oxford University and used to be the British governor of Hong Kong, will probably understand why this is important.

There is also enough space to build a memorial near the Chinese embassy in the centre of London.

21,21_0,0,"Confused anti-vaccine protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre, where they were filmed shouting abuse at staff and appearing to steal equipment. Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs.","On Wednesday, some anti-vaccine protesters who seemed confused went into a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes. They seemed to think it was a place where coronavirus vaccines were given. They were filmed shouting angrily at the people working there and it looked like they were stealing things.

A video on social media showed a group of around thirty protesters. Jeff Wyatt, who used to be a candidate for the Ukip party, was leading them. They walked through the centre holding signs that told people not to get vaccinated. The signs also criticised the BBC.

Wyatt used to be a leader in a far-right group called For Britain Movement. He spoke to a crowd at a gathering before they went into the Covid-19 testing site. He said that there were ""millions"" of people who think like them and have ""woken up"" against vaccines.

Piers Corbyn, who often protests against lockdowns and is the brother of Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the Labour party, was not seen in the video. But he was seen in pictures at other places during the ""Freedom Rally"", including when they went into the Milton Keynes Theatre.

People were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre. A man with a loudspeaker said that it was where the ""vaccine rollout"" was happening. The protesters walked past a sign that said ""Testing"". Some protesters shouted ""disgrace"" and ""shame on you"" while the workers seemed to run away and hide in offices.

In some videos, a woman was seen opening a sign that said ""Reclaim NHS, End Jab"" in one of the small rooms. Then she took a big box that seemed to have testing equipment and papers in it. She wasn't wearing a mask and was smiling at the cameras as she left the testing site.

The Thames Valley police said that they knew about the anti-vaccination protest in Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. They said in a statement that if people have broken the law, they will take action quickly and punish them. They also said that if anyone has information or wants to report something, they can call 101 or do it online, using the reference number 604 29/12/2021.

Many members of parliament said that the actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were ""disgraceful"" and they were widely criticised."
21,21_1,1,"The local Tory MP Ben Everitt described the protesters as “dickheads” and urged anyone with information to contact police. Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow secretary of state for international trade, described the protest as “dreadful”, at a site where “NHS staff are working over the festive season to help others”. He urged anyone with information to pass this on to Thames Valley police. Former health secretary Matt Hancock criticised the activists’ “appalling behaviour”. The Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, Alicia Kearns, described the scenes as “shameful, self-aggrandising nonsense”. Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said the group’s actions were “totally unacceptable”. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scenes were “disgraceful”. “For months now we have been warning need legislation to tackle those who harass others seeking healthcare. Government promised to act weeks ago but nothing as yet. Enough. It’s not free speech when 50% of debate in fear,” she said. Matthew Barber, police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, said it was “appalling” to see the protest “escalate into something much uglier”. He added that he had spoken to Thames Valley police officers to discuss the police response on Wednesday evening, and said that “criminal offences will be investigated and appropriate action taken”. “All of the events of today will be reviewed to help plan for future protest events and ensure that colleagues in the NHS can continue their fantastic work in delivering the vaccine rollout,” he said. Joe Harrison, CEO of Milton Keynes University hospital, said: “I am very sorry and angry to see NHS colleagues at Milton Keynes Covid testing centre harassed and intimidated at their place of work. “Our staff having to deal with increasing aggression and violence for simply doing their job. It’s abhorrent, unacceptable and we will not stand for it.”","Ben Everitt, the local MP from the Conservative party, said the protesters were “stupid” and asked anyone who knew something to tell the police.

He asked anyone with information to give it to the Thames Valley police. Matt Hancock, who used to be in charge of health, said the activists' actions were “terrible”. Alicia Kearns, the Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, said what happened was “shameful and just people trying to make themselves look important.” Helen Morgan, a Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said what the group did was “completely not okay”. Stella Creasy, a Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scenes were “disgraceful”. “For many months, we have been saying we need laws to stop people who bother others who are trying to get healthcare. The government said they would do something weeks ago, but nothing has happened yet. Enough is enough. It's not freedom of speech when half of the discussion is based on fear,” she said. Matthew Barber, who is in charge of the police in the Thames Valley area, said it was “awful” to see the protest “get much worse”. He said he talked to police officers from Thames Valley about how they handled the situation on Wednesday evening. He also said that “crimes will be looked into and the right action will be taken”. “We will look at everything that happened today to help us plan for future protests and make sure that NHS staff can continue their great work giving out the vaccine,” he said. Joe Harrison, the boss of Milton Keynes University hospital, said: “I am very sorry and angry to see NHS workers at the Milton Keynes Covid testing centre being bothered and scared at their workplace. “Our staff are having to deal with more and more aggression and violence just for doing their jobs. It’s horrible, not acceptable, and we will not allow it.”"
22,22_0,0,"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","Mudassar Kadir, who used to work as a journalist for the BBC in Afghanistan, escaped from the Taliban. But now, he is stuck in a refugee camp. This is because the UK government is taking a long time to start a plan to help people like him move to the UK.

Mudassar Kadir is the only one of 14 people who used to work for the BBC who has left Afghanistan since the Taliban took control in August. The other 13 are still hiding because they are afraid for their lives.

Kadir also worked for the World Bank and the old government of Afghanistan. He hoped that he and his family could start a new life after leaving Afghanistan. But after escaping in early October with help from an American charity, Kadir, his wife, and his two young sons have been living in a refugee center near Dubai.

The Kadir family is thankful to the United Arab Emirates for giving them a safe place to stay and they are being taken care of well. However, they are not allowed to go more than 100 meters from the building. Also, the UAE will not accept requests to stay in the country permanently.

Kadir is very annoyed because the UK government has said no many times when he asked for help. He is still afraid of being sent back to Afghanistan because working for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban.

He said, “The UK should look after me and my family. My life is in danger because I worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this, but they have not helped me.” He also said, “At first, we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now I am getting more and more frustrated every day.”

People who are trying to help refugees say that the Kadir family's situation shows how difficult it is for thousands of Afghan people who have left their country. They cannot go back home because they are afraid of being treated badly. And they cannot go to other countries because these countries are not willing to give them refugee status.

The UK government has promised a plan called the Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) to help up to 5,000 people each year, starting in January. This is in addition to another plan called the Afghanistan Relocation and Assistance Policy (Arap), which is more difficult to get into.

Kadir cannot get help from Arap because this plan has only helped less than 400 people so far. He also cannot apply for ACRS because it has not started yet. When it does start, it will only accept requests from organizations that help refugees.

People who are trying to help refugees are worried that the UK government is delaying the start of the plan on purpose to reduce the number of people who can come to the UK."
22,22_1,1,"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office disagrees with this. A person speaking for the Home Office said, ""The ACRS is one of the best plans our country has ever had. It will give up to 20,000 more people who are in danger a new life in the UK."" They added, ""We are working hard to start the plan quickly, even though things are complicated and changing. We are working with different parts of the government and groups like UNHCR to create the plan."" The Home Office will not talk about individual situations. When asked why things are taking so long, the Home Office said they are creating a system to use ""biometric enrolment"" (using things like fingerprints) and check if people are allowed to come. This is to make sure that the people they accept will not be a danger to the UK.

The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants is helping Kadir and many other people in the same difficult situation. They say that time is running out. Minnie Rahman, who is temporarily in charge of the Council, said, ""Three months ago, our government said they would give a 'warm welcome' to Afghan refugees. But now it looks like there is not much of a welcome at all."" She continued, ""Like Kadir, it seems many Afghans have been sadly left alone by the British government, even though they have clear connections to the UK. The plan to help them resettle here is still not open. It is still very difficult for families to reunite. And it seems our government cannot offer safety to many people who risked their lives to work with us and really need it.""

The National Union of Journalists has been asking the government to help get visas for all the Afghan people who used to work for the BBC. This includes one person who survived an attack on a relative's house in October. Michelle Stanistreet, who is in charge of the Union, said, ""While the process of helping people resettle is moving very slowly, the journalists who are affected are living in fear and have to hide. We need quick and strong action to make sure that all the Afghans who are in great danger can travel safely to the UK.""

A person speaking for the BBC said, ""We feel very sorry for our former staff, but we are not able to give them direct help.""

Kadir said, ""I hope that the UK government will do what they promised for me and my family. But right now, it seems that no one is paying attention to my case. I arrived in the UAE two months ago, and there has been no progress at all.""

23,23_0,0,"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","As we start a new year, the world has many big problems. These include Covid-19 coming back strongly, the serious climate situation, the fight between countries that are democracies and those that are not, difficult situations for people needing help, many people moving to different countries, and terrorism that crosses borders.

There is also a danger of new wars between countries. This is made worse because the rules that countries used to follow are not working as well anymore. Also, weapons that can decide on their own who to attack are becoming more common. So, for most people in the world, 2022 will be another year where things are not safe.

**Middle East Events**

Events in the Middle East will be important news again in 2022. Some of these events will be good, and some will be bad. One good thing is the World Cup in Qatar in November. It's the first time that a country in the Arab world or a Muslim country will hold this competition. This is expected to be good for business and tourism in the Gulf area in the future. It might also lead to governments becoming more open and modern.

But, choosing Qatar was controversial because some people said there was corruption. Qatar's human rights record will be watched more closely. How Qatar treats workers who are paid very little is another problem. The Guardian newspaper said that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar was chosen to host the World Cup in 2010. They died while building new stadiums, roads, hotels, and an airport.

People are still worried about Qatar not allowing people to speak freely, and about how they treat women and LGBTQ+ people. In Qatar, it is still dangerous to say bad things about the government, and being homosexual is against the law. But some experts think that most fans will not pay attention to these things. This could make the Qatar World Cup the best example of ""sports-washing"" so far. ""Sports-washing"" is when a country uses sports to make itself look better.

Apart from the World Cup, other problems will be important in the region. One big question is whether Israel or the US will take actions, like using the military or economy, to stop Iran from trying to build nuclear weapons. Iran says it is not trying to do this. Israel has said it might use air strikes if talks to bring back the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans would not be able to ignore a war in the Gulf."
23,23_1,1,"Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence.","People will be watching Turkey and its leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. His political party, AKP, which is a religious conservative party, will have been in power for 20 years in 2022. Erdoğan has become more and more controlling in Turkey. Also, his strong foreign policies, arguments with the European Union and the United States, sometimes working with Russia about Syria, and bad management of the economy could cause problems.

Other places that might have problems are Lebanon, which is close to becoming a failed country like Yemen which has been at war, and Libya, which is always in chaos.

We should also watch Palestine. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, is not liked by many people and he has delayed elections. Also, Israeli settlers are using violence and taking land in the West Bank. There is no progress in making peace.

In Asia, many people will be watching China at the beginning and end of the year, and probably in between too. The Winter Olympics will start in Beijing in February. Sports fans will want to know who wins the most medals, but some countries like the US and UK will not send government officials to the Games. They are protesting China's bad treatment of human rights. They worry that the Games will be used by the Chinese Communist Party to show off.

The Chinese Communist Party will have a big meeting, called the 20th national congress, near the end of the year. President Xi Jinping wants to stay in power for another five years, which has never happened before. If he does, he will be the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong. People will also be competing for important jobs in the government.

It might not be easy for Xi. Experts in the West don't agree on how strong Xi's position really is. The economy is getting slower, there is a lot of debt, the population is getting older, there are big problems with the environment and climate change, and the US is trying to stop China's power by making agreements with countries nearby. All of these things are putting pressure on Xi.

But, as things are now, China will probably continue to try to increase its economic and political power around the world in 2022."
23,23_2,2,"A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister.","If China attacks Taiwan, which the Chinese leader Xi has said he wants to take back, even by force, it would change a lot of things. India is China's biggest competitor in the area, but it might not have as much power in the world as it could. Some people think that soon, India might have as many people as China, which has about 1.41 billion people. But at the same time, in India, people are having fewer babies and smaller families. A more serious problem is that India and China have not agreed on where the border is in the Himalayas. This caused fighting in 2020 and 2021 and shows that the relationship between the two countries is getting worse.

The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who has a lot of power, has become less popular recently because of the pandemic and the slow economy. He had to change his mind about some new rules for farmers, which was embarrassing for him. Also, people say he is using laws about terrorism to stop people from criticizing him. His political party will try to win back support in some important local elections in 2022. Modi wants to have better relationships with countries in the West. He has joined an alliance called the Quad with India, the US, Japan, and Australia. This will probably make China feel even more worried.

In other parts of Asia, the government in Myanmar is using violence to control people. In Afghanistan, people are in a very bad situation since the Taliban took over. Western countries will probably just worry about it and not do much to help. Afghanistan is in danger of collapsing. David Beasley from the World Food Programme says that 23 million people are going to starve. He says the next six months will be terrible.

North Korea might cause a crisis with its nuclear weapons. The leader, Kim Jong-un, seems worried about being attacked and is sending mixed messages about whether he wants war or peace. The Philippines will choose a new president because the current president, Rodrigo Duterte, who often uses bad language, can only be president for one term. Unfortunately, Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister of Australia, can try to be re-elected, and he will."
23,23_3,3,"Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine.","Europe will have a very important year. The EU and leaders of countries will have to deal with difficult problems inside Europe and with other countries. The pandemic is still causing problems for people and the economy. There are also problems with people moving to Europe, and new challenges to reach the goals for zero emissions after the COP26 meeting.

More importantly, Europe needs to decide if it wants to be a strong player in the world, or if it will let China, the US, and countries like Russia under Vladimir Putin have more power. The elections in France and Hungary in the spring may show what will happen. In these countries, right-wing groups are again pushing ideas that divide people.

Viktor Orbán, the leader of Hungary who has not followed the rules of the EU about law, democracy, and freedom of speech, will face people who are working together against him for the first time. People in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and other EU countries where right-wing parties are popular will be watching what happens to him.

Emmanuel Macron, who became president of France in 2017, will ask French people to vote for him again instead of Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour, who have racist ideas against Muslims. Polls say that Macron is ahead, but Valérie Pécresse, who is the first woman to lead the Republican party, could also be a strong challenger. The left is not doing well, so the election could make France more right-wing.

There will also be elections in Sweden, Serbia, and Austria. The new government in Germany, led by the SPD party, will be watched closely. People will see if they can do things differently after Angela Merkel was in charge for so long. Even though they have promised to work together, it will be hard to avoid disagreements with the European Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen who is a friend of Merkel, and with France and other countries in southern Europe about money and debt.

France will be in charge of the EU in January, and Macron will try to push his ideas about working together on defence and security, which he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron believes that Europe needs to stand up for itself in a difficult world, and this will be tested in many areas, especially in Ukraine."
23,23_4,4,"Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world.","Experts believe that Russia might put more military pressure on other countries. This includes sending a lot of soldiers to the border and saying they might use nuclear weapons. This could cause fighting to start again early next year, and NATO might not want to get involved. Other problems that could start conflicts include Belarus using migrants as a weapon (and there's still no good plan in Europe for dealing with migrants in a kind way). Also, there could be trouble with people wanting to break away from Bosnia-Herzegovina and other places in the Balkans.

The European Union is planning a meeting with China, but they can't agree on how to balance making money and protecting human rights. In Britain, which is becoming more isolated and poorer, people are likely to regret leaving the EU (Brexit) even more. The relationship with the United States might be difficult because the US doesn't like Europe becoming too independent. Also, the US seems unsure about what to do about Ukraine. NATO's reputation was damaged after what happened in Afghanistan, and they will have a hard year finding a new leader. Many people think a woman could get the top job for the first time. Theresa May, who used to be the Prime Minister of the UK, has been suggested, but France probably won't want someone from Britain.

In Latin America, there will be important elections in Brazil in October. People will be fighting to stop Jair Bolsonaro, the current president who is known for his right-wing ideas, from winning. This will be a big battle with effects around the world. In Brazil, many people criticize Bolsonaro for how he handled the Covid pandemic, saying he was very careless. More than 500,000 Brazilians have died, which is more than any country except the US. Outside Brazil, people dislike Bolsonaro because he doesn't believe in climate change and he is making the Amazon rainforest disappear faster. Polls show that if Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was in jail but is now cleared of corruption, runs against Bolsonaro, he would probably win easily. But this assumes the election is fair. People are worried that people who supported Donald Trump in America are helping Bolsonaro's team to cheat in the election or try to take over the government, like Trump tried to do in Washington last year but failed. There are fears that other people around the world might try to copy Trump's way of trying to unfairly influence elections."
23,23_5,5,"Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision.","Surveys in Europe show that people may be supporting right-wing, nationalist politicians less now. But this might not be true in South America, except for Brazil, and other developing countries in 2022. Populism grows when there is a big difference between corrupt leaders (“elites”) and “ordinary people”. In many poorer countries, this difference in wealth and power is getting bigger.

In countries like Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who were supposed to help the people have become their oppressors. This problem seems likely to continue.

In Chile, in the first part of the presidential election, José Antonio Kast, a very right-wing person who defended Pinochet, got a lot of support. But he was finally defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist who used to be a student leader. Boric will become the country's youngest leader after winning strongly in the second election round.

Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, has a different problem. He is likely to have a difficult year because in recent elections, his Peronist party, one of the oldest populist parties in the world, lost its majority in Congress for the first time in almost 40 years.

Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will continue to have problems with the US about trade, drugs, and people moving from Central America. But at least he doesn't have to deal with Trump's insults anymore – for now.

In North America, everyone will be watching the elections in November. The Democrats will try to stop the Republicans from taking control of the Senate and House of Representatives again. The results will probably be seen as a way to judge Joe Biden's time as president. If the Republicans do well in important states, Donald Trump – who still says wrongly that he won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for president again in 2024.

Some important issues will affect the whole country. These include how well the country is dealing with the pandemic and the ongoing resistance to vaccines. Also important are the economy, with prices and interest rates expected to increase, and difficult social issues like immigration, race, and abortion rights. It is expected that the Supreme Court will change or weaken the important Roe v Wade decision from 1973."
23,23_6,6,"The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September.","In 2022, the biggest problem for the Democrats could be disagreements inside their own party. There are differences between Democrats who want big changes and those who want more moderate policies. This split, especially in the Senate, made it difficult for President Biden to pass his important bills about social programs and fixing roads and bridges. These bills were changed to be less ambitious because of the disagreements.

People will also be watching President Biden closely. They will be asking if he will run for president again in 2024. He will be 80 years old in November, and some people are wondering if he is still sharp and able to do his job well. It may be hard for him to improve his popularity, which was quite low in mid-December.

Vice-President Kamala Harris will also be watched carefully. Some people say she is unhappy and not doing as well as she should. These opinions might come from people who want to create problems for the White House.

Pete Buttigieg, who is the Secretary of Transportation and wanted to be the Democratic nominee in 2020, is someone to watch. He could possibly replace Harris, or even Biden, if Biden decides to only serve one term.

There are also concerns about whether the elections in the middle of Biden's term will be fair. Republicans in some states have been trying hard to make it more difficult for people to vote. They are also changing the borders of voting areas to make it easier for Republicans to win. One study says that Republicans will probably win at least five more seats in the House of Representatives because of these unfair voting maps. This could mean that Republicans will control the House even before the voting starts.

The number of people from Central America trying to enter the US at the southern border will likely continue to be a big issue in 2022. Vice-President Harris was asked to deal with this problem, but she has not been successful so far. Some people say that she and Biden are continuing the same strict policies that former President Trump used.

People's belief in Biden's ability to do his job well has also been hurt by the messy withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Many people felt like it was a big failure for the US, like the Vietnam War. Another big problem in foreign policy, such as Russia taking land in Ukraine, China attacking Taiwan, or a war between Israel and Iran, could involve the US military and make Biden's presidency even more difficult.

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to introduce new plans for affordable childcare and housing after winning the election in September."
23,23_7,7,"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","But in the quick election of 2021, Justin Trudeau's Liberal party got the smallest part of the votes ever for a winning party. This makes people think that Trudeau is not as popular as he used to be. People are arguing about possible dishonest actions, how the pandemic was handled, trade with the United States, and plans to reduce carbon.

Africa: As you might expect from a large continent like Africa, some of the most important topics of 2022 will be seen in Africa. One of the most important questions is whether Africans, who are mostly not vaccinated yet, will suffer a lot because richer countries have taken all the vaccines for themselves. These richer countries are not willing to give away extra vaccines or share their patents. Also, the pandemic has caused many health and money problems.

This question makes us think about another thing: will this selfish behavior hurt the richer countries in the end? Gordon Brown, who used to be the UK Prime Minister, has warned about this many times. The fast spread of Omicron, which was first found in South Africa, suggests that more versions of Covid could appear in 2022. But once again, richer countries might focus on protecting themselves instead of working together with other countries.

We can't really know what will happen with the pandemic in 2022, both for people's health and the economy. But in many African countries, where there are more young people who are less likely to get very sick from Covid, the bigger problem might be that it's harder to deal with other diseases. It is thought that 25 million people in Africa will have HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria kills almost 400,000 people every year. Treating these diseases, and others like TB and diabetes, might get even worse because Covid has put a lot of pressure on the healthcare systems.

Many experts think that Africa, not the Middle East, has become the place where international terrorism is most active. This is likely to continue in 2022. The countries in the Sahel area have seen more radical Islamic groups. Most of these groups are local, but they often say they support global groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western countries might try to organize their efforts to fight this rise in violent extremist groups in 2022."
23,23_8,8,"This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought.","This situation is happening because the presidents of the US, Joe Biden, and France, Emmanuel Macron, made an agreement to work together. France stopped its military actions in Mali because it didn't have enough support there.

Western countries are worried because radical Islamic ideas are spreading from countries in West Africa, like Nigeria, to other places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique, which has a lot of energy resources.

Somalia is a country that is not working well, and the group al-Shabaab is active there. It shows what can happen when terrorism is not controlled. This is a warning for other countries.

This year, the US will have another meeting about democracy around the world. The problem of not having good democratic governments in some places will be a big topic. This is especially important in Africa, where there were many government takeovers in 2021, most recently in Sudan.

This problem is closely connected to extreme poverty. The International Rescue Committee, a charity, has a list of countries that are most likely to have serious problems with people's basic needs in 2022. According to them, 12 of the 20 countries most at risk are in Africa. These countries are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger, and Cameroon. (The countries outside of Africa that are most at risk are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, and Venezuela.)

In the Horn of Africa, the International Rescue Committee says that Ethiopia has many problems all happening at once. These problems are getting worse because of a civil war that could break the country apart. Also, Eritrea, a country next to Ethiopia with a very strict government, is interfering more and more.

At the same time, the United Nations says that a very bad drought is getting worse quickly. They warn that 7.7 million people in Somalia could be in extreme danger by April.

UNICEF, the United Nations charity for children, is asking for a lot of money - $9.4 billion - to help more than 327 million people around the world in 2022. This includes 177 million children who are having problems because of disasters and the Covid virus.

These difficult situations are part of a bigger problem for 2022: international migration. This means people moving from one country to another. Some are refugees escaping from fighting, others are seeking asylum because they are being treated badly for their beliefs, and still others are economic migrants who have to leave their homes because of climate change, lack of food, and drought."
23,23_9,9,"The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars.","In 2020, a record number of 281 million people, or 3.6% of all people in the world, were considered international migrants. This is according to the UN's International Organisation for Migration. Even though it was harder to travel between countries because of the pandemic, this number is still going up.

These big changes in where people live haven't made most governments, especially in rich countries like those in North America and Europe, work together to find good solutions. Maybe this will change in 2022, but it's not very likely.

The next big meeting about the climate crisis, called Cop27, will be in Egypt in November. This meeting is a follow-up to the Cop26 meeting in Glasgow. They will talk about how well countries are doing with the promises they made in Glasgow. These promises include reducing carbon and methane gases, stopping deforestation, using less coal, cutting money given to fossil fuels, and giving money to poorer countries to help them with the damage caused by climate change.

It's not likely that the world's climate problems will get better quickly in the next year. We will probably see extreme weather like we did in 2021, such as fires, droughts, floods, storms, and very high temperatures.

These problems will affect the most sensitive places in the world, especially Antarctica and the Arctic. Both of these areas will have more human activity in 2022, and that's not necessarily good. For example, in Antarctica, many tourists are starting to visit because there are now ice runways where big planes can land.

Even more worrying is that China, and other countries, are becoming more interested in using Antarctica's resources and building military places there. Also, because the ice in the Arctic is melting, it's now possible to travel by ship across the top of the world. Russia is working hard to develop these sea routes, and other countries are competing with them.

Greenland, which has been ignored for a long time, is now a place where companies want to find minerals and start mines. Defence planners are also becoming more interested in Greenland. However, the people who live there are starting to say no to giving out licenses for these activities.

Space will also be busy in 2022 with exploration and military competition. Nasa is planning 18 different missions in 2022 as they get ready to send people back to the moon. They are also planning a new space station called Gateway. Russia, South Korea, India, and Japan will launch spacecraft to the moon. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars."
23,23_10,10,"China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind.","China wants to have a working space station orbiting the Earth by the end of this year. At the same time, space trips for tourists are becoming more popular. These trips are being organised by Russia and private companies like Virgin Galactic, which belongs to Richard Branson, and Blue Origin, which belongs to Jeff Bezos.

However, something more worrying is happening too. There could be a race to build nuclear weapons in space. The US, Russia, and China are all testing new weapons. For example, they are testing vehicles that can fly very fast around the Earth and launch nuclear missiles from anywhere in space.

Russia made people angry in 2021 when they tested a missile that could destroy satellites. This test was dangerous. Other countries might do the same, which could cause problems for communication around the world.

Not wanting to be left behind, NASA has a plan to change the direction of a large asteroid in September. They will crash a spacecraft into the asteroid. The spacecraft will be launched on a rocket made by SpaceX, which belongs to Elon Musk.

The US calls this ""planetary defence,"" which means protecting the Earth from asteroids. But the same technology could also be used to attack things.

Some people might think this is progress, but others might think it is a big step backwards for humans."
24,24_0,0,"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails.","A survey by the Guardian newspaper has shown the ""terrible"" amount of abuse, threats and frightening behaviour aimed at the UK government's science and medical experts. These experts have been helping the government during the pandemic.

Many UK advisers said they had experienced problems, from organised attacks online to death threats. Some people took photos of their houses and shared them on the internet. Some advisers received strange packages in the post, sometimes with messages written on them.

Other types of harassment included very angry messages on Twitter, emails and phone calls. Some experts received hate mail and threats of violence. People complained to their bosses and reported them to the General Medical Council, which checks on doctors. Some people found nasty notes on their cars, and others had abuse shouted through their letterboxes.

The police have taken action in a few cases where they found the people who made specific threats.

The advisers were not the only ones affected. The abuse also spread to their students, work friends, and families, including their partners and children. One adviser, who is also a family doctor, said that the people answering the phone at their doctor's office were given ""awful angry speeches"" by callers because of the adviser's work for the government. In another situation, a teacher kept bothering an adviser's child because they blamed the parent for the government's rules about staying at home. The family did not complain officially because the child's grades depended on what the teacher thought.

The Guardian sent the survey to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers. These people help to advise ministers through groups like the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the groups that help Sage with numbers and people's behaviour, and other expert groups like Nervtag and the JCVI. The answers to the survey were kept private.

Three out of four of the 42 people who answered said they had received a lot of abuse about the government's plans, their opinions on the science, or what they had found in their research. This often happened after they were quoted in the news or spoke at public events, like meetings in parliament or online talks organised by groups like the UK's Royal Societies.

Professor John Edmunds, who studies diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and is a member of Sage, wrote an article for the Guardian. He said that he and his younger colleagues regularly received abusive emails."
24,24_1,1,"“If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers.","He says that when you talk about vaccination in the news, especially when it's about children, people will probably react. But, this mostly happens if newspapers that support right-wing ideas, like the Daily Mail, write about your comments.

One of the experts who was asked questions in a survey got a death threat on Twitter. They told the police about it. They also had lots of bad comments sent to them whenever they were on TV or in the news. A doctor said that a lot of these comments were aimed at women and were very nasty. They said they had never experienced anything like it before and that they were only trying to help stop people from dying.

A lot of these comments come from people who are more worried about what the government is doing about the pandemic than about the pandemic itself. However, the experts are not making the rules about what to do. Many experts say that the bad comments get worse when they talk about masks, vaccines, ways to treat Covid, short lockdowns, or long lockdowns. This means it is happening more often now that the Omicron variant is spreading.

When the pandemic started last year, there were so many threats that security experts from the government told the experts how to protect themselves. They were told how to make their computers safer, how to be safer when travelling to work by changing the time and route, and how to check under their car before driving. Some experts have had their homes and workplaces checked by security, and alarms and cameras that are watched all the time have been put in. These cameras are connected to the police station.

Some universities have hired security companies to help the experts stay safe and to make sure that people protesting do not stop them from working. Government computer experts have taken down some private information that was put online, but they couldn't always do this.

Many experts said they received a lot of hate through Twitter and email. Some of the messages said things like, ""I hope your family die,"" ""I hope bad people like you are punished,"" ""You will pay for killing our children with vaccines,"" and ""Go away back to your own country.""

Some experts also said that sometimes the main news sources made things worse by talking about the worst things that could happen. They also made it seem okay for people on social media to be nasty by attacking the experts themselves."
24,24_2,2,"The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”","The survey did not find clear proof that women were abused more than men. However, some women were not as ready to talk about what they had experienced. Many men said they were shocked by how strong and awful the abuse was that women they knew received. One man said, ""It looks like there is a big difference between men and women. Women seem to be targeted much more than men.""

Even though there was a lot of abuse, several advisors said that they also got praise, thanks, and help from people. This made up for the bad things they received. One advisor said, ""It has made me stronger against a lot of the hate.""

George Freeman, who is the science minister, said the abuse was ""terrible."" He said, ""All of us who care about our freedom and democracy need to speak out against this. Scientists and doctors should not be blamed for decisions that ministers made honestly and are responsible for to the parliament.""

Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were ""completely unacceptable."" She said the government needs to pass the online safety bill quickly to stop the spread of wrong information.

Many advisors thanked the Cabinet Office and the Sage team for creating ""many support systems."" However, some advisors felt they would have been helped by a warning and security advice before they started.

Because of the attention, some scientists are trying to stay out of the spotlight. They are refusing interviews and thinking about stopping speaking in public. But most said the abuse did not affect them much or even made them stronger. One advisor said, ""If anything, it made me want to do more. It was clear that people were listening to my voice and it was making a difference.""

Another advisor said, ""If we stop talking and giving advice, something else will take its place. That will be wrong information and false stories. Should we give in and let them take over and risk people's lives?"""
25,25_0,0,"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban].","Ashraf Ghani, who used to be the president of Afghanistan, has spoken for the first time since he left Kabul four months ago. He said that the international community, especially the Americans, were responsible for the fall of Afghanistan.

Ghani told the BBC that he had to leave Kabul quickly in a helicopter. His national security advisor, Hamdullah Mohib, and the person in charge of protecting the president were very scared and told him to leave. Ghani said, ""They said that the presidential protection service had failed, and if I stayed, everyone would be killed. Mohib gave me only two minutes to decide.""

He was talking to General Sir Nick Carter, who used to be the head of the British army. Carter was in charge of the BBC Radio 4’s Today program for that day.

Even before Ghani left, it was clear that the Taliban were going to take control of Afghanistan. But when Ghani left so suddenly, it ended any chance of a peaceful change of power. This could have allowed some help to continue coming into the country and stopped the plans for a government that included different groups.

Now, Afghanistan is facing a serious food shortage. The country’s economy has become much smaller, losing more than a third of its value. Also, the health and education systems are in trouble because the foreign money they depended on has suddenly stopped.

Carter asked Ghani what he would say to the Afghan people, because many of them ""blame you as their leader"" for the terrible situation. Ghani said that his biggest mistake was trusting Afghanistan’s allies. He said, ""They have every right to blame me for this, because I trusted our international partners and followed that path. We all made a big mistake by thinking that the international community would be patient for a long time.""

Ghani criticized the United States for not including his government in the peace talks with the Taliban for many years. He said that the agreements signed by Zalmay Khalilzad, who was the US peace representative, basically gave up the Afghan people so that the US troops could leave easily. Ghani said, ""The American team is clearly responsible for how things were done and what the result was. We were never allowed to sit down and talk with the Taliban."""
25,25_1,1,"Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue. They erased us.” Khalilzad said in his own interview with the Today programme that the collapse of the republic was due to a “failure of Afghan leadership” and Afghan troops that did not “resist hard” against the Taliban. Six months ago the two men were among the most influential figures shaping Afghanistan’s future; now neither are willing to accept any responsibility for the tragedy stalking the country. Carter asked the former president about any personal regrets that had surfaced in the last 100 days. Ghani did not mention the humanitarian crisis, but he lamented the damage to his reputation and legacy. “My work has been destroyed. My values have been trampled on, and I’ve been made a scapegoat.”","Ambassador Khalilzad talked to them. After that, it was a problem for America, not for Afghanistan. They forgot about us."" Khalilzad also said in an interview on the Today programme that the Afghan government fell apart because the leaders of Afghanistan didn't do a good job and the Afghan soldiers didn't fight hard enough against the Taliban. Six months ago, these two men were very important in deciding what would happen to Afghanistan. But now, neither of them wants to be responsible for the sad situation in the country. Carter asked the former president if he felt sorry about anything in the last 100 days. Ghani didn't talk about the problems people are having with food and help, but he was sad that his reputation and what people think of him had been damaged. ""My work has been ruined. My beliefs have been ignored, and people are blaming me for everything."""
26,26_0,0,"Thousands of South Africans will pause to remember the anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90, every day this week as bells are rung at churches across the country for 10 minutes at noon. Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country.","This week, many South Africans will stop to think about Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a famous person who fought against apartheid. He died on Sunday at the age of 90. Every day, church bells across the country will ring for 10 minutes at 12 o'clock to remember him.

Since his death in a care home in Cape Town, people all over the world have been sharing their respect for Tutu. He was called the ""moral compass"" of South Africa. There will be many events to remember his life and what he did.

Former US president Barack Obama said that Archbishop Tutu was a person who cared about everyone. He fought for freedom and fairness in his own country, but he also cared about unfairness everywhere.

Tutu, who won the Nobel Prize, will be in a special place for people to see him for two days. Then, on 1 January, his funeral will be at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town, where he used to work. The bells of the cathedral will ring for 10 minutes at 12 o'clock every day until Friday to honor him. His ashes will be put in the cathedral.

There will be many memorial services across South Africa in the next few days. Flags will be flown lower than usual as a sign of respect. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba said on Monday that bells will ring at 12 o'clock each day at the cathedral and at many other churches in the country. In Cape Town, people will also say the Angelus prayer.

South Africa is a country with problems. There is still a lot of inequality, politics are divided, and the bad effects of apartheid are still felt. But the death of Tutu, who was a very important person in the fight for freedom, has brought a rare moment of unity.

Since the news of Tutu's death, people from all groups have been visiting St George's Cathedral. Many are leaving flowers under a picture of him on a wall of remembrance, next to a South African flag. Others are writing in a book of messages to show their sadness.

One of them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old nurse who is now retired. She said that Tutu was a hero to them and fought for them. She said that they are free because of him, and without him, the country might have been lost."
26,26_1,1,"He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo. Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party.","""He was simply good,"" said Mokwadi, holding her granddaughter's hand tightly. ""He was important to everyone, not just people who go to the Anglican church,"" said Brent Goliath, a person who came to remember Tutu. He started crying outside the old stone building. He said he used to help at the altar in the church and had met Tutu a few times. ""I felt very sad this morning when I heard he had died. I am thankful to God that he was there for us,"" he said, wiping his eyes as he put some pink flowers under a picture of Tutu. Daphney Ramakgopa, who is 58 and works for the local government, talked about how the whole country was sad. ""We respected him and thought of him as someone who gave advice to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,"" she said. The South African cricket team wore black bands on their arms to show respect for Tutu on the first day of the cricket match against India in South Africa. Table Mountain in Cape Town was lit up in purple to honor him. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said he was a man with ""amazing intelligence, honesty and strength against the unfair system of apartheid."" Ramaphosa said that Tutu's death was ""another sad moment for our country as we say goodbye to a generation of great South Africans who gave us a free South Africa,"" after the former president FW de Klerk, who was in power during apartheid, died in November. ""Fighting for freedom in South Africa took a kind of courage that is hard to explain,"" said Graça Machel, the wife of Nelson Mandela. Even though Tutu had not been in the public eye much lately, he continued to fight for the things he believed in, like equal rights for LGBT people, everyone having the chance to go to school, and the right to choose assisted dying. This special priest, who was known for his happy laughter and relaxed way of being, was also very serious about his beliefs. He also often criticized the African National Congress party, which is the party in power in South Africa."
26,26_2,2,"Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer.","Because of the Covid rules in South Africa now, only 100 people can go to the funeral. Church leaders said that only a small number of people who want to be there can fit in the church. The service will be an Anglican memorial service, which is what Archbishop Desmond Tutu wanted. Michael Nuttall, a retired bishop, will lead the service. He was known as “number 2 to Tutu”.

In the 1980s, Nuttall and Tutu had a very good relationship. Church officials said that they showed how a white leader could work with and support a black leader. Tutu was born in a small town near Johannesburg on October 7, 1931. He started working for the church after he quit his job as a teacher in 1958. He quit because he didn't like the unfair laws in South Africa. This was ten years after the National party won the elections and started the apartheid system.

Tutu studied religion in the UK. He would ask for directions even when he didn't need them, just to hear white police officers call him ""Sir"". He quickly became important in the church. By the late 1970s, Tutu was a well-known leader in the fight for freedom. He made leaders in other countries think about the bad things that happened because they supported the white government in South Africa during the Cold War.

In 1984, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize because he believed in fighting for what was right without using violence. Soon after, he became the Archbishop of Cape Town. In 1994, Mandela became president after the first free elections in South Africa. Tutu called South Africa the ""Rainbow Nation"" and led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which showed the terrible things that happened during apartheid.

But Tutu also criticised the new leaders of South Africa. He questioned Mandela, who was his friend, about the high salaries that government ministers were getting. He also strongly criticised President Jacob Zuma, who left office in 2018 because people said he was taking money unfairly.

Tutu was told he had prostate cancer in 1997 and had treatment many times. He didn't appear in public as much after that."
26,26_3,3,"In one of his last this year, he emerged from hospital in a wheelchair to get a Covid-19 vaccine, waving but not offering comment. The archbishop had been in a weakened state for several months and died peacefully at 7am (0500 GMT) on Sunday, according to several of his relatives. The Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu “an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.”","This year, one of the last things he did was leave the hospital in a wheelchair to get a Covid-19 vaccine. He waved to people, but he didn't say anything.

27,27_0,0,"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","This year has been very bad for human rights in Russia. It started with the jailing of Alexei Navalny, who is a leader of the opposition. But the closing of International Memorial is especially cruel.

This group was started in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other people who disagreed with the Soviet government. They used the new freedoms that Mikhail Gorbachev gave them to show the real stories of millions of people who suffered under Stalin’s rule.

Memorial was a clear sign that Russia was becoming more open. For many Russians, it was very important. They learned about the sad lives of their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, which had been kept secret for many years.

The closing of Memorial is also a strong symbol. It shows that Russian society is being taken apart very quickly. The leaders of Memorial hoped that people would support them, including famous Russians like Gorbachev, and that this would stop the government from closing them down. They also thought that closing an organisation that talked about the bad things that happened in the Soviet Union would be too much, even for Vladimir Putin.

But on Tuesday, almost 30 years after the Soviet Union ended, a judge showed that this was not true. Nikita Petrov, who is a historian and helped start Memorial, told the Guardian newspaper last month, “When Russia decided to become a democratic country, I never thought that things would start going backwards. Maybe I was too hopeful.”

It’s easy to understand why Putin sees the investigation of Soviet history as a danger to Russia's safety. He is very worried about old problems, like Crimea, the expansion of NATO, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Second World War. He cares more about what he thinks are unfair things that happened to Russia in the past than about the difficult truths that Memorial found in the Russian archives over the last 30 years.

After Memorial was closed, the organisation said, “Our country needs to understand the Soviet past in an honest and careful way. This is the key to our future.”"
27,27_1,1,"In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","Instead of Memorial, which talked strongly and clearly about terrible acts of violence against many people, the government is making a more controlled and careful showing of the deaths of millions of people. This new version talks about how sad the deaths were, but not so much about the murders. It names the people who died, but not the people who killed them.

The Russian government wants people to think that closing Memorial is just a normal, official thing because of the laws about ""foreign agents"". But on Tuesday, a lawyer in court made the political reason clear. He gave a very emotional speech saying that Memorial was ""lying by saying the USSR was a terrorist state"". He asked, ""Why should we, the children of those who won the war, have to see people who betrayed their country and helped the Nazis being seen as good people?""

A lawyer for Memorial said this reminded him of a fake trial from the 1930s. The leaders of Memorial have said it is pointless trying to understand what they did wrong to make the government close them down. Some people think it is because of their work saving old documents and information about Soviet terror. Others think it is because they help political prisoners like Navalny.

But the truth is that Memorial has been doing the same things it has always done. It is Russia that has changed again. Maybe the short time when it would allow people to honestly look at its past is over. Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch, said, ""This shows that the government is afraid. It doesn't want people to honestly talk about what it has done, which is what Memorial does."" He added, ""If the truth is too terrible to see, the answer is to change what you are doing, not to break the mirror."""
28,28_0,0,"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","Some local governments in Spain are now offering menstrual leave to their workers. They are among the first in western Europe to do this. They want to help people balance their jobs with the pain that can come with periods.

This year, the city of Girona in Catalonia was the first in Spain to think about letting workers work in a different way if they felt unwell because of their periods. In June, they said they had an agreement with their 1,300 workers. This agreement lets women, trans men, and non-binary people take up to eight hours of menstrual leave each month. But, they have to make up this time within three months.

Maria Àngels Planas, the deputy mayor of Girona, said that Girona is famous for many things. She also said that they are now adding something new to that list: being the first to approve menstrual leave. She said they are getting rid of the taboo, or the feeling of shame, around periods and the pain that some women feel during them.

Soon after, the towns of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques in Catalonia also said they would have similar rules. In September, the city of Castellón de la Plana in eastern Spain said they had agreed with their 1,500 workers to have a menstrual leave policy like Girona's. This happened after some workers asked for it.

In many parts of Asia, rules about periods have been in place for a long time. These rules often started because people worried that jobs could stop women from having children. In 2016, a newspaper called The Guardian talked to some women in Japan and China. They said they didn't want to use the menstrual leave because they were afraid it would make their male coworkers angry or hurt their chances of getting a promotion.

In the same year, a company in Bristol called Coexist said it would be one of the first places in the west to offer menstrual leave. They hoped to change the office culture, where people felt they had to choose between working when they felt very unwell during their period or using sick days or holiday time. This decision caused a big discussion around the world about whether the policy was a good idea. However, the managers at Coexist said that their workers seemed more dedicated and worked better. Research also showed that about 14% of women had taken time off from work or school because of their periods. It was because of all this that the workers union in Girona first suggested the idea of menstrual leave."
28,28_1,1,"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","Sílvia Rubio from the Intersindical-CSC union said, ""There were many different opinions about this."" At first, the union representatives thought about asking for up to two days off each month. But they stopped this idea because they were worried that companies might not want to hire women or give them important jobs. ""To make sure there was no unfair treatment because of being a woman, we decided that any hours taken off would be worked later,"" said Rubio.

Talking with the city council was also difficult. The union first asked for 16 hours off a month, but they had to reduce it to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that some of their own colleagues didn't like the idea either. ""There was a lot of disagreement,"" she said. ""Some women said: 'My husband gets bad headaches, so why can't he take this time off?'"" Other people were worried that the policy would make women seem weak or suggest that periods are always painful.

Rubio explained the bigger picture. ""We think it's great that we have achieved this. This is a problem for women all over the world. It's something people feel embarrassed about and no one is dealing with it. We managed to do it,"" she said. ""But we don't want to stop here."" She sees this policy as a first step to making workplaces more flexible. This would help people with things like long-term illnesses or needing to look after family. ""All of this is a way to make workplaces better for both women and men, in both government jobs and private companies."""
29,29_0,0,"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has broken records in France and Europe for new coronavirus cases. This is because the Omicron variant is causing a big increase in cases across Europe, and many countries are reaching new high numbers. On Wednesday, France said that 208,000 people had the virus in the last 24 hours. This is more than the day before, when they had almost 180,000 cases.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, said, “This means that every second, day and night, two people in France are finding out they have the coronavirus. We have never seen anything like this before.” He said the increase was making him feel “dizzy”. He also said that hospitals in France were already worried because of the Delta variant. Even though the big wave of Omicron cases has not yet affected the hospitals much, he said that it will happen in the future.

The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Greece have all reported new record numbers of cases this week. Outside of Europe, the average number of new cases in the US over seven days reached a high of 267,000 on Tuesday. Omicron is causing 59% of these cases. In Australia, new infections went up to almost 18,300 on Wednesday. This is much higher than the previous high of about 11,300 the day before. The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, said that the country needs to “change gears”.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the Delta and Omicron variants are spreading at the same time. This is causing a worrying wave of infections that could mean more people going to the hospital and more deaths. The head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “very worried that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is causing a tsunami of cases.”

The WHO has said that Omicron is a “very high” risk and could make health systems unable to cope. Studies in Britain, South Africa, and Denmark suggest that Omicron is less dangerous than other versions of the virus. However, because so many people are testing positive, hospitals in some countries might soon have too many patients, and businesses might have problems because workers have to stay home.

The new variant is spreading so quickly that governments are finding it hard to decide what to do. They need to find a good balance between putting rules in place to protect hospitals and keeping businesses and everyday life going."
29,29_1,1,"Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10, even as the number of new infections hit record highs, after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”.","Spain has changed its rules about staying at home if you might have Covid. Now, you only need to stay at home for seven days instead of ten. This happened even though the number of new Covid cases is very high, the highest it has ever been. Companies were worried that because of the Omicron virus, many of their workers would have to stay home, and they wouldn't have enough staff.

In Italy, the government decided on Wednesday night that people who have had three Covid vaccine shots do not need to stay at home if they have been near someone who has Covid. However, Italy also made the rules stricter for people who have not been vaccinated. From January 10th, you will need to show proof that you have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid to travel by bus, metro, train, or plane inside Italy. A suggestion to make the rules tougher for unvaccinated workers was not accepted. On Wednesday, Italy reported a new record number of Covid cases: 98,030.

In France, politicians started talking about a new law on Wednesday. This law would only allow vaccinated people to go to bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas, and other public places. A negative Covid test would not be enough to get in.

Italy is one of several countries that have cancelled or limited public celebrations because the virus is spreading again. Greece has also stopped Christmas and New Year parties in public places. On Wednesday, Greece introduced new rules for restaurants and bars sooner than planned. This is because the country announced a new record of 21,657 Covid cases in one day, which is more than double the number from Monday. Bars, nightclubs, and restaurants in Greece must close at midnight. Customers cannot stand up, and there is no music allowed. However, on New Year's Eve, they can stay open until 2 a.m. The health minister, Thanos Plevris, said that if these rules are followed well, life can go back to normal in mid-January.

Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to arrive. In Germany, the number of Covid cases is still going down. But the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said that the real number of cases could be much higher. This is because fewer people are getting tested during the holidays. He said that the real number of cases could be ""two or three times as high"" as the reported number. On Wednesday, Germany reported 205 Covid cases for every 100,000 people over seven days, which is the lowest number since November. He added that he expects the number of cases to increase quickly ""within a very short period of time."""
29,29_2,2,"On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors. It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events. Lauterbach said the rules may have to be toughened further, as existing measures “will not be enough to prevent a significant rise in Omicron cases”. In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated.","On Tuesday, Germany closed all nightclubs. They also told the people in charge of sports events that no audience could watch them. Germany also said that private meetings could only have 10 people who have been vaccinated. If someone at the meeting is not vaccinated, only two families can meet. These new rules are in addition to the rules that already affect people who are not vaccinated. They are not allowed to go to shops, restaurants, or cultural events.

Karl Lauterbach said that the rules might need to become stricter. He said that the current rules ""will not be enough to stop a big increase in Omicron cases.""

But in Belgium, the number of cases is not very high. Because of this, the government changed its mind on Wednesday. They said that theatres and cinemas could open again after a court stopped them from being closed.

At the same time, other countries in Europe are still having problems with the Delta variant. Poland said that 794 people died from Covid on Wednesday. This is the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. Waldemar Kraska, who is in charge of health, said that more than 75% of the people who died were not vaccinated."
30,30_0,0,"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city.","It seems Ukrainian soldiers are getting closer to taking back the important city of Kreminna in Luhansk. This city is currently controlled by Russia. There is a lot of fighting going on in the east and south of Ukraine.

Serhiy Haidai, who is in charge of the Luhansk region, said that Russian soldiers in Kreminna had to move back to Rubizhne. Rubizhne is a town a few kilometres to the south-east. This happened because the Ukrainian army was pushing them hard.

Haidai wrote on Telegram, a messaging app, that “The Russians know that if they lose Kreminna, their whole defence line will break.” He also said that “The Russian soldiers have built a very strong defence in just over a month. They are bringing in many more soldiers and equipment. They are always bringing in new soldiers to replace the ones fighting.”

The Guardian newspaper has not been able to check these reports about the fighting themselves.

If Ukraine can take back Kreminna and the nearby town of Svatove, it could then attack Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these two cities in the summer.

The fighting is very intense, and there are no signs that peace talks will happen soon.

On Monday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that Ukraine must agree to Russia’s demands. These demands are “demilitarisation and denazification.” If Ukraine does not agree, Lavrov said they will lose the war.

Lavrov’s words show that Russia still wants to change the government in Ukraine. This is even though Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that Russia was ready to talk about ending the war.

The British defence ministry said on Tuesday that Russian soldiers are still trying hard to capture the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.

Russian soldiers and fighters from the Wagner group have been trying to take Bakhmut since July. They have reached the edge of the city.

Bakhmut is mostly destroyed after five months of fighting. Both sides are calling it the “Bakhmut meat-grinder” because so many soldiers are dying there.

The fight for Bakhmut is seen as important for Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner group. He has reportedly brought in thousands of Russian prisoners to help attack the city."
30,30_1,1,"Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory. Since the start of the war, a number of military targets, including oil and weapon depots have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks inside Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as payback.","Prigozhin has said before that the Russian defence ministry is not doing well in Ukraine. He has also said that Wagner soldiers are the best fighters in Russia. In a video that came out on Monday, two men who seem to be Wagner soldiers are saying bad things about Valery Gerasimov, the chief of general staff. This video was probably filmed near Bakhmut. It will likely make people think that there are problems between different parts of the Russian army. One of the men in the video says, ""You are… the damn devil. We don't have anything to fight with, we don't have any shells."" The Guardian newspaper has not been able to check if the video is real. But when Russian journalists asked Prigozhin about the video, he seemed to agree with what the soldiers did. He said he went to Bakhmut to meet them. Prigozhin said, ""The guys asked me to tell you that when you are sitting in a warm office, it is difficult to understand the problems at the front."" This seems to be a criticism of the top military leaders in Russia. Last Thursday, Ukraine said that Russia had moved some of its planes away from the Engels airfield. Moscow said that a Ukrainian drone had attacked the airfield the day before, and three Russian soldiers died. Colonel Yuriy Ignat, who speaks for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media, ""After what happened yesterday, we can see that the planes have been moved. Especially the planes used for big attacks. Some planes are still there, but many have been moved to other airfields."" In other news, Russia's security services said they had ""killed"" four Ukrainian soldiers. They said the soldiers were on a secret mission in the Bryansk region of Russia, which is near the border with Ukraine. If this is true, it shows that Ukrainian soldiers are still doing secret things inside Russia. Since the war started, many military places, like oil and weapon stores, have been damaged by fires. Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, doesn't say openly that it attacks places inside Russia. But it has said it is happy when these things happen, as it is like getting revenge."
30,30_2,2,"Also on Tuesday, Putin concluded his two-day “informal summit” in St Petersburg with the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a Moscow-led group consisting of former Soviet states, by gifting the eight leaders present gold rings. The meeting came on the back of growing unease between the Russian president and the rest of the CIS bloc, as nations have sought to distance themselves from Moscow’s faltering war.","On Tuesday, something else happened. Putin finished his two-day meeting in St Petersburg. This was a relaxed meeting with the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States. This group is led by Moscow and includes countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union. At the end of the meeting, Putin gave gold rings to the eight leaders who were there. This meeting happened after a time when there was more worry between Putin and the other countries in the CIS. These countries are trying to move away from Russia because of the problems with Russia's war."
31,31_0,0,"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce.","Because of the big changes in China's rules about coronavirus, European countries are getting ready to watch out for new types of the virus that might come from there. Spain and France have started making people take tests at airports again if they are arriving from China.

These two countries are doing the same as Italy, which already asks people coming from China to show they have a negative test. But Spain will let people in without a test if they can prove they have had all their vaccines.

When Spain's health minister, Carolina Darias, told people about the new rules, she also said she wants to change the rules for getting the EU's special digital pass for Covid.

More people are getting sick in China, and some countries don't trust the numbers that China is sharing. Because of this, some countries outside the EU, like the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, have also started checking people for Covid again. The UK has said they will do the same.

The media in China said that asking people from China to take tests is not fair and is done for political reasons to make China's opening up look bad.

But in Brussels, Berlin, and Paris, leaders said that it's important to be careful, but it's too soon to be very worried about the virus in China. China has the most people in the world.

Germany's health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said that it's ""not necessary yet"" to make people take tests if they are coming from China through Germany into the Schengen area (where you don't need a passport to travel between countries).

He said that the information China is giving about the different types of Covid is not good enough. ""So we have to check things ourselves,"" he said. For example, they will look at flights carefully.

The person in charge of health policy for the European Commission asked the 27 countries in the EU to think about checking the virus in more detail and looking at wastewater (including from airports) to find any new types of the virus that might come from China.

In a letter to the health ministers of the EU countries, Stella Kyriakides said that the EU should be ""very careful"" when China lets people travel more freely on January 8. She said that it's hard to get good information about the virus and testing in China right now."
31,31_1,1,"In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, argued that requiring Covid tests for all passengers from China was “only effective if it is taken at the European level”, noting that many people arrive in Italy on connecting flights through other European countries. After an announcement made by Italy’s health ministry on Thursday, travellers from China are obliged to show a negative test result upon embarking on their flight and to take a second antigen test upon their arrival.","According to a report by Reuters, Kyriakides told ministers in a letter that they should quickly check how they are using gene sequencing to study the coronavirus. Earlier that week, Giorgia Meloni, the Prime Minister of Italy, who has very right-wing views, said that making all people coming from China take Covid tests would ""only work well if it's done across Europe."" She explained that many people travel to Italy by changing planes in other European countries. After an announcement from the Italian health ministry on Thursday, people travelling from China must now show a negative Covid test before they get on their plane. They also need to take another quick test when they arrive in Italy."
32,32_0,0,"Brazil has been gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepared to both welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons. Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration.","Brazil is getting ready for a very important new year in its history. The country is preparing to welcome a new president and also say goodbye to a very famous person.

On January 1st, a lot of people are expected to be in Brasilia. They will be there to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva become president for the next four years. Then, on the next day, football fans will meet in Santos. They will say goodbye to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday.

Pelé, whose real name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento, died because his organs stopped working. He had been fighting colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old, who used to play for Santos and the New York Cosmos, had been in the hospital for over a month.

Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist, said, “The city is very sad.” He used to write about Santos when they were very successful in the 1960s and was friends with Pelé and his family. He added, “Everyone here is sad because Pelé was a big part of our lives. He made us very happy. It's like we have lost a family member.""

In Brazil, funerals usually happen within one day of someone dying. But Pelé’s family asked for more time. They wanted to give family members time to come together for a goodbye that will likely be very emotional.

Pelé was married three times. He had seven children and many grandchildren. Some of them live in the United States, and others live in different parts of Brazil. Brazil is a very big country, almost as big as Europe.

Many people are expected to come to the city and the area around it, where almost 2 million people live. Many news reporters from around the world will also be there.

The current president, Jair Bolsonaro, is not expected to go to the funeral. He was named Jair after a football player called Jair da Rosa Pinto who used to play for Santos. News reports on Friday said that Bolsonaro will fly to Florida soon. This means he will not give the presidential sash to Lula, the new president.

In his last speech as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticized Lula's new team of people working for him. He also criticized one of his own supporters who was caught planning to blow up a fuel truck before the new president takes office on Sunday."
32,32_1,1,"That terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia, and the weekend is set to be both tense and festive – but whatever happens could be overshadowed by the following day’s events. Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides.","The possibility of terrorist attacks has made people in Brasilia worried. The weekend will be exciting because of celebrations, but also tense because of the security concerns. But what happens this weekend might not be as important as what happens the next day. Lula's inauguration will have important people from over 120 countries. However, Pelé's death is something the whole world is talking about. The plans for his funeral are like a funeral for a leader of the country.

Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars, and old friends all sent messages of love and sadness when they heard about his death on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro said there would be three days of national sadness. Lula, the new leader, said: ""Few Brazilians have made our country as famous as he did. Even though people spoke different languages, people all over the world knew how to say the magic word: ‘Pelé.’”

The president of Santos, the football club where Pelé became famous, sent a sad message. He said people would never forget Pelé. Andres Rueda said, “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever. He came to Santos as a young boy and became a king. Not only the fans of Santos loved him, but all of Brazil and all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, please watch over us.”

Santos said that Pelé’s body is at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo. Early on Monday morning, it will be taken 50 miles to the Vila Belmiro stadium, where his club plays. The coffin will be put in the middle of the football field, and fans can come to say goodbye and show their respect. His body will stay there for 24 hours. Then, on Tuesday at 10 am, there will be a private funeral for his family. The cars in the funeral will leave the stadium and drive through the streets of the city. They will also drive past the house where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, lives. She celebrated her 100th birthday in November."
32,32_2,2,"The former athlete of the century will be laid to rest at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies that claims to be the tallest in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a space on the ninth floor of the building almost two decades ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out. Pelé is loved by people here and by fans of the club because he projected the name of Santos all over the world.”","Pelé, who was once called the best athlete of the century, will be buried at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica. This is a very tall cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies. It says it is the tallest cemetery in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a place on the ninth floor of this building almost twenty years ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be buried on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, used to wear the number 9 shirt when he played football. The place where he will be buried has a view of the Vila Belmiro stadium. Pelé chose this place because it gave him “spiritual peace and quiet” and because it “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think many people will come,” said Dias, talking about the public event to remember Pelé. “The city is getting ready and people will come. Pelé is loved by people here and by fans of the football club because he made the city of Santos famous all over the world.”"
33,33_0,0,"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","When 2022 started, many countries were having problems with Covid and the possibility of a war in Ukraine. But in China, things were quite peaceful. The ""zero-Covid"" plan from Xi Jinping was working well, and there weren't many people getting sick. Sometimes there were lockdowns, but they were organised and people followed the rules.

This stable situation was probably what Xi wanted to happen before he took a third term as leader, which was something new in China's history. He wanted China to become even stronger. He had plans for China to be the most important country in the world for money, to control everything inside the country, to take over Taiwan, and to have more power in the world.

But as the year ends and 2023 begins, China is facing new and difficult situations. In the past year, there have been big problems with houses and the economy. There was also a difficult situation near Taiwan in August. Other countries have put rules on China because of human rights problems, and the US has stopped China from getting important computer chips. China's relationship with Russia has also been complicated.

Xi did become leader for a third time, but just a few weeks later, people started protesting all over the country. They were very brave to disagree with the government, and it seemed like the ""zero-Covid"" plan would end suddenly.

Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a great year for the Chinese president. But instead, according to Jerome Cohen, an expert on China, it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”. He said, “His country is in trouble, and many people have lost respect for him.”

At a big meeting in October, called the 20th party congress, Xi was chosen to be the leader for another five years. This made him the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong. This was different from what previous leaders had decided, because they wanted to stop power from being controlled by just one person. Xi made his own ideas, called “Xi Jinping thought”, the most important part of the party's plan. He also got rid of people who disagreed with him. One example was when the former president, Hu Jintao, was taken out of the meeting hall in a strange way.

Now that Xi has so much power, some people are worried about the decisions he might make, especially because he is surrounded by people who always agree with him. Professor Steve Tsang, who is in charge of the Soas China Institute, said, “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022.”"
33,33_1,1,"“Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn.","Xi probably believes that his ideas (Xi Jinping Thought) are a good guide for China's future. However, he is actually leading China into unknown situations. The most worrying of Xi's plans is to take over Taiwan. But experts don't think he will try to do this soon.

Last year, there was a very big increase in Chinese military actions towards Taiwan, which governs itself. In August, the first official paper on Taiwan during Xi's time said that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is ready to use force to take the island. When Nancy Pelosi, a leader from the US House of Representatives, visited Taipei, Beijing used this as a reason to show its power. They increased their military actions against Taiwan to the highest level ever.

The US is important in the relationship between China and Taiwan. The US has shown more support for Taiwan by suggesting it could become a ""non-major NATO ally"" and by spending a lot of money on defence to sell weapons to Taiwan.

Ma Chun-Wei, from Tamkang University in Taiwan, says that China can't really fight against the US. So, instead, it focuses its actions on Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. We can expect more psychological and online attacks, as well as economic pressure, before Taiwan's next presidential elections in early 2024.

Yun Sun, who leads the China Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, says that China will increase its pressure on Taiwan as long as the Democratic Progressive party, which wants Taiwan to be independent, is in power.

On Monday, Taiwan said that 71 Chinese air force planes, including fighter jets and drones, had entered Taiwan's air defence zone in the last 24 hours. This is the largest number of planes reported so far.

The CCP's actions on Taiwan have been a main reason why Xi's relationship with the West has become worse. The party's continued bad treatment of people who disagree with them in Hong Kong, and the abuse of people in Xinjiang, which the UN's human rights leader said in August could be crimes against humanity, have also made the divide bigger.

The relationship was also made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which happened just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin said they had a ""limitless"" friendship. Beijing has refused to condemn Russia's actions."
33,33_2,2,"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”. Zero-Covid restrictions and the near collapse of the property development sector punished China’s economy this year.","The invasion of Ukraine has made things difficult for Xi Jinping in politics. It has put him in a tricky situation on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has to manage his friendship with Putin, his desire to avoid problems with the sanctions against Russia, and the competition between China and Russia for influence and trade in Central Asia.

American officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons to help with the war. China didn't give weapons, but they have helped in other ways. This includes working together on spreading news and false information, and trying to stop Western countries from using sanctions. Chinese officials have clearly supported the invasion, and the armies of China and Russia have recently done military exercises together.

Also, fights involving Chinese diplomats have made Xi's relationship with Western countries worse. In December, China's top diplomat in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent back to China. This was because they were involved in beating up a person protesting for democracy in Hong Kong outside the Chinese office in Manchester in October. They avoided being questioned by the police in the UK.

But international relationships are still important to Xi. After he started his third term as leader, he quickly began talking to many leaders from around the world, including Joe Biden. According to Cohen, Xi is trying to make his government look better ""after using strong and aggressive policies too often.""

Xi's efforts to improve relationships will be a test for the world. Maya Wang from Human Rights Watch says that many countries had become stricter about China's human rights record this year. She is worried that ""after these meetings, many governments, like Germany, will become less strict with China and will not focus on human rights as much as before.""

For now, governments are still taking a firm stand. The United States is continuing with plans like sanctions on China's computer chip industry. Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join these measures, which will cause problems for Xi's plans to improve China's struggling economy. Tsang from SOAS says that these measures ""may have a bigger and longer impact [than Covid] on the Chinese economy in 2023."" The strict Covid rules and the problems in the property market have hurt China's economy this year."
33,33_3,3,"To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone. A faltering economy could further provoke domestic frustrations, which peaked in 2022 over the impact of Xi’s signature hardline zero-Covid policy. For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled. With no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel restrictions or mass testing, Covid cases have soared across China. Mass fatalities are predicted, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus.","To help with the problems caused by buildings collapsing, the Chinese government has given 1.4 trillion yuan (£166 billion) to begin building again. Analysts from Trivium think this money ""will help builders start building more"" and will help China's economy.

But the government will still have to deal with the economic problems caused by the zero-Covid policy and the new waves of sickness that will come now that the policy has ended. If the economy is weak, it could make people even more angry. People were very angry in 2022 because of the problems caused by Xi's strict zero-Covid policy.

For two years, China used this policy, which allowed most people to live quite normal lives and kept the number of deaths low. But then Omicron, which spreads very easily, was too much for the policy to handle, and it caused problems for the economy and people's lives. People became tired of sudden and badly managed lockdowns, and some protests started. These protests were made worse by some sad events, like a bus crash involving people in quarantine and a fire in a building in Xinjiang that was under lockdown.

These protests were the biggest in China since 1989. Most people were protesting against the problems caused by the zero-Covid policy, but they also complained about censorship and showed they didn't like Xi. The protests made some Chinese people aware of how the government treats people from minority groups and people who disagree with them.

Cohen says, ""The bad handling of the pandemic has made people more aware that the government doesn't respect its own laws, even though it tries hard to show that it follows the law.""

The government quickly used the police to stop the protests. But the protests seemed to have had an effect. Within a week, the zero-Covid policy, which many people thought would last for many more months or even years, was suddenly stopped. Now there are no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel rules, or lots of tests. Covid cases are going up quickly all over China. Experts think that many people will die, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus."
33,33_4,4,"On Monday, in his first remarks on Covid since the shift in policy, Xi urged officials to take steps to “feasibly protect people’s lives” and said: “We should launch the patriotic health campaign in a more targeted way ... fortify a community line of defence for epidemic prevention and control, and feasibly protect people’s lives, safety and health.” Trivium says what happens next with Covid and Covid policy is “the most important question” politically and economically, for China and Xi in 2023: “It’s not at all clear how this plays out.” The past year has brought far more for China than Xi would have hoped, or analysts expected. Tsang says that, in the end, events have still largely worked out for Xi, even if protests took the shine off his leadership. “He mostly got what he wanted, including not just a third term as top leader but also a leadership filled by his supporters,” says Tsang. “It is less clear that it was equally good for China, as Xi’s amassing of near dictatorial power is costing China dearly.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin","On Monday, Xi spoke about Covid for the first time since the rules changed. He told people in charge to take actions to ""really protect people's lives."" He also said: ""We should start a health campaign to help our country in a better way. We need to make our communities strong to stop the spread of the virus and really protect people's lives, safety, and health.""

Trivium says that what happens next with Covid and the rules about it is ""the most important question"" for China and Xi in 2023, both in politics and money. They say: ""It is not clear what will happen.""

The last year has been much harder for China than Xi wanted, or experts thought. Tsang says that things have mostly gone well for Xi in the end, even though the protests made his leadership look less good.

""He mostly got what he wanted, including a third term as the top leader and a leadership team full of people who support him,"" says Tsang. ""But it's not as clear if it was good for China. Xi has gained almost complete power, and this is costing China a lot.""

Chi Hui Lin also helped with this report."
34,34_0,0,"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","China is getting ready for another wave of Covid to affect the countryside, where people are more at risk, in early 2023. This is because the current wave of infections is making hospitals and intensive care units in many cities very busy. The Lunar New Year, which is the most important holiday in China, is at the end of January. It gives people a chance to meet their families after they were separated for years because of strict travel rules and lockdowns as part of the zero-Covid policy. However, hundreds of millions of workers are expected to travel back to their hometowns, and many are likely to bring the disease with them. These areas have fewer hospitals and clinics, not enough doctors and nurses, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for healthcare.

One person from a small town in Henan province wrote on WeChat, a Chinese social media site, “When it comes to a virus like Omicron, everyone should have the same chance of getting better, but the truth is that cities and the countryside are not equal in terms of the virus.” They added, “Not only are resources and opportunities unfair, but people also have different ideas about how to deal with public health.”

Airfinity, a British health company, believes that the next wave of infections will probably affect rural areas in late winter. It could affect even more people than the current wave in cities. The situation could get worse because the government has suddenly changed the way they talk about Covid. They used to say the virus was very dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. But now, they are telling Chinese people that it is not much worse than a cold.

The person from Henan who posted on WeChat said, “In my hometown, they have quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick. They say, ‘Every family has caught a cold’, so there is nothing to worry about.” This means that the government is not encouraging simple actions like social distancing, which could slow down the spread of the disease and give hospitals more time to cope.

Jeremy Wallace, a professor at Cornell University, said, “I am very surprised that the message seems to be denying how much people are suffering from this wave. As far as I can see, there is no information about slowing down the spread to reduce the pressure on the overwhelmed healthcare system.”"
34,34_1,1,"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","Because of this, I think a very large number of people will die, like the models predicted when looking at what happened in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. This could be about 1 million people. Some experts think that in some cities, Covid is spreading so quickly that infections might reach their highest point soon. However, it's hard to know exactly what is happening because when China reduced its Covid controls, it also stopped publishing many Covid numbers.

China used to be proud of its Covid numbers. But now, as more people are dying and getting infected, the National Health Commission (NHC) has said that it will no longer publish the number of deaths each day. On Friday, even though there were many pictures and stories of hospitals that couldn't handle all the patients, the NHC said that there had been only one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, according to AFP news.

However, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people are dying from Covid each day in China. They think that next month, this number could increase to 25,000 a day. The company predicts that by April, up to 1.7 million people could die.

Jiao Yahui, a spokesperson for the NHC, admitted this week that China is not counting many deaths as Covid deaths that would be counted in other countries, according to AFP news. In other parts of the world, any death that happens within 28 days of a positive Covid test is counted. But China has decided to only count people who die from breathing problems caused by the virus.

Jiao said that ""China has always used scientific rules for deciding if a death is from Covid-19, from the start to the end, and these rules are in line with international rules.""

China's news systems are saying that the government's sudden change in how it is dealing with the pandemic – from strict controls to letting the disease spread – has been managed perfectly. But social media is full of sad stories about what life is really like during the pandemic.

Chinese authorities usually quickly stop people from criticizing the government online. But surprisingly, many posts that talk about the reality of Covid in China today are being posted online and staying there for some time, said Charlie Smith, who helped start Greatfire.org, a website that watches for censorship. He said, ""Most of these posts are staying up because the rules for censorship are changing so fast that the people who censor them can't keep up."""
