Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim worked for Brazil for a long time. He worked for the government for almost 60 years. He got to the highest position. But even he has trouble remembering a year like 2019 in Latin America.

He said, ""Like this? Never before."" He was talking about the problems in Latin America in 2019. Many countries had problems. They were in South America and Central America.

The year started with problems in Venezuela. It was only January. People were angry and protested in the streets. Many people thought Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, would lose his power.

People protested a lot. They thought Maduro would fall soon. There was also a failed army uprising. Juan Guaidó tried to remove Maduro, but he failed. Then things became quiet, but not for long.

In other places, problems were just starting. There were protests and violence in Puerto Rico and Haiti. Ecuador and Bolivia also had problems. In Bolivia, the president, Evo Morales, had to leave his job. The army used violence. Some people wondered if it was like the ""Arab Spring"" in Latin America.

In Peru, the president closed the congress. In Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner became important again in politics. In Colombia, many people protested against the president, Iván Duque.

Even Chile had problems. People thought Chile was safe and rich. But subway tickets became more expensive. This made people angry. It was the worst unrest in Chile for many years. There was damage and destruction. The future of the president, Sebastián Piñera, was not clear.

Ivan Briscoe works for the International Crisis Group. He said he was surprised about Chile. He asked, ""Where did that come from?""

As a new year was coming, Briscoe said he felt things were changing very fast in Latin America. The future was uncertain."
0,0_1,1,"“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","Things have been happening for many years.
For example, Chile has different social classes.
In Bolivia, Evo Morales wanted to stay in power forever.
Venezuela has a big problem with fighting.
Now, these problems are becoming clear.
We do not know what will happen next.

Someone said he knows where the problems will be next year.
But he does not know exactly what will happen.

Some people on the left in Latin America are happy about this confusion.
Amorim said the problems are a reaction from people.
They are reacting to neoliberalism.
Neoliberalism is hurting countries like Colombia and Chile.

He said it is hard to know what will happen.
But something is different.
Eight months ago, it looked like everything was going to the right wing.
Now, it is not so clear.
So, even with the problems, there is some progress.

Latin America is having a difficult time.
But for the left, this trouble is better than nothing happening.

The year is ending soon.
People are thinking about what will happen next.
A report said there is a big chance that protests will spread.
The protests in Colombia were inspired by protests in other countries.

The report said 2020 will be another hard year for Latin America.
Ecuador will have a very difficult time.

Amorim agreed that it is like a bomb.
Any country could explode again.

Briscoe said there will be three problem areas in 2020.
First, Venezuela is getting worse with politics and people's needs.
Second, Brazil and Argentina have a fight between their leaders.
The leaders have different ideas.
Third, Mexico's president is trying to stop a lot of murders.
Almost 100 people are killed every day."
0,0_2,2,"Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.","In 2014, many people in Mexico were angry. Forty-three students went missing. This made the country very sad. Briscoe said this could happen again. He said it could happen if the killings do not stop.

Briscoe also talked about Bolivia. He said there could be problems there. This could happen if Luis Fernando Camacho wins. Camacho is a very right-wing person. If he wins, he might run against someone from Evo Morales' party. Morales' party is on the left.

Briscoe said things could be difficult. He said this about Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. He said things could go wrong in these countries. He said people are very unhappy. He said Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Chile could also have problems.

Some people think Brazil is also at risk. Brazil is the biggest country in Latin America. Lula da Silva used to be the president. He told people to be like Chile. He wanted them to fight against the president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is very right-wing.

Some people think Bolsonaro has stopped the anger. They think he has stopped people from protesting in the streets. But Monica de Bolle said Brazil could be next. She knows a lot about Latin America.

She said people are not protesting now. But she said things can change. She thinks people will protest soon. Maybe in 2020 or at the end of 2020. People might see that the economy is not getting better. They might think Bolsonaro's ideas are not good. Then, his support will get smaller.

She said this could be like the past. She said it could be like 2013. In 2013, many people protested. These protests led to Dilma Rousseff losing her job.

Amorim also said Brazil could have problems. He said people are angry with Bolsonaro. He said Bolsonaro is not doing a good job."
0,0_3,3,"“There hasn’t yet been a popular reaction [against Bolsonaro] – but I think it will come. If there’s a small spark it could very easily propagate,” he said. But perhaps not quite yet. “Everything here in Brazil is slow,” Amorim admitted. “Except samba.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

People are not angry with Bolsonaro now. But I think they will be angry later.
If something small happens, it could make people very angry. The anger could grow fast.

But maybe this will not happen soon.

Amorim said that things in Brazil are slow. Almost everything takes a long time.
But samba is not slow. Samba is fast!"
1,1_0,0,"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago.","People were protesting in Iraq. They were angry at the American embassy in Baghdad. This was bad for the US.

The people shouted, ""Death to America."" They also supported groups that liked Iran.

Many protesters went to the US embassy. It was a bad day for the US government.

The protesters broke into the embassy area. They broke doors and windows. They started fires. They threw things at the glass.

Iraqi security let the protesters in. The area was usually very safe. The protesters climbed walls and threw stones.

US guards used tear gas. They did not shoot.

Donald Trump said Iran planned the attack. The attack happened after the US bombed some places in Iraq and Syria on Sunday.

The places belonged to a group called Kata’ib Hezbollah. This group is from Iraq and is supported by Iran.

Many fighters from this group died or were hurt in the bombing.

The US said they bombed the places because the group attacked a US base in Kirkuk on Friday. One American was killed and some were hurt.

President Trump said it was okay to bomb the places on Saturday.

The bombing seems to have made things worse. The Iraqi government was very angry.

The pro-Iran groups said they would attack the US again. They want the US soldiers to leave Iraq.

Trump said, ""Iran killed an American. We will always fight back."" He also said Iran was attacking the US embassy. He said Iran will be responsible.

The US embassy said the ambassador and his staff did not leave quickly. Some news said they did, but it was not true. The ambassador, Matthew Tueller, was on vacation. He left one week ago."
1,1_1,1,"The embassy was under lockdown but had not been evacuated, the spokesperson said, with diplomats sheltering in a safe-room. Video from the scene showed thick grey smoke engulfing the compound against a backdrop of wailing from an emergency siren. Protesters shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. By nightfall fires were still burning. One masked man walked off insouciantly with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part.","The embassy was closed. People could not go in or out. The spokesperson said the embassy was not empty. Diplomats were inside a safe room. They were hiding there.

Videos showed smoke. The smoke was grey and thick. It was all around the embassy. There was a loud siren.

People were shouting. They shouted, ""No, no, America!"" They shouted, ""No, no, Trump!"" They shouted, ""Death to America!""

At night, the fires were still burning. One man had a mask. He took a sign from the US embassy. He walked away.

Some people said this was like the attack on the US embassy in Tehran in 1979. In Tehran, 52 Americans were taken. They were held as prisoners.

But Tuesday's events were not as bad. Nobody died. The embassy building was not destroyed.

But the situation is still bad. There might be a bigger fight soon. It could be between US forces and Iranian groups in Iraq.

The US is putting pressure on Iran. They are using money and rules. But this has not helped. The relationship between the US and Iraq is very bad now.

The Prime Minister of Iraq is Adel Abdul-Mahdi. He is friends with Iran and the US. He said he will keep US people safe.

At first, Iraqi soldiers did not stop the violence. But then, they came in the afternoon. They made a line between the angry people and the US guards.

The US Secretary of State is Mike Pompeo. He talked to Abdul-Mahdi. He said the US will protect its people.

The US embassy in Baghdad is very big. It is the biggest in the world. Now, people are asking if it can stay open. Protesters are putting up tents outside the embassy.

Many of the protesters were at funerals. The funerals were for dead fighters. The fighters were from a group called Kata’ib Hezbollah. They were also carrying flags from Hashd al-Shaabi. Hashd al-Shaabi is a strong group of soldiers. Kata’ib Hezbollah is part of this group."
1,1_2,2,"Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the Iranian-backed Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq militia, and many other senior militia leaders were among the demonstrators. On Monday, Iran condemned the US strikes as “terrorism”. Russia complained it had not been given advance warning. Street protests take place regularly in the Iraqi capital. In recent months, security guards have shot dead more than 450 people protesting against rampant government corruption and the growing influence of Iranian-backed groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah.","Qais al-Khazali was there. He is the leader of Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq. This group has help from Iran. Many other leaders of groups were there too. They were all at the protest.

On Monday, Iran said the US attacks were ""terrorism"". They did not like the attacks. Russia was not happy either. They said nobody told them about the attacks before they happened.

There are protests often in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. In the last few months, many people have died at the protests. Security guards shot more than 450 people. The people were protesting about bad things in the government. They also did not like that groups from Iran had too much power. Kata’ib Hezbollah is one of these groups."
2,2_0,0,"A magnitude-5.1 earthquake has struck near Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant on Friday, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes.","Okay, here is the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level English learners:

**Earthquake near Nuclear Plant**

There was an earthquake in Iran on Friday. The earthquake was near the city of Bushehr. Bushehr has a nuclear plant.

The earthquake was not very big. It was magnitude 5.1. The US Geological Survey said this.

The earthquake was 53 km from Bushehr. Bushehr is on the coast. It is near the Persian Gulf.

The earthquake happened early in the morning. It was 5:23 am. The earthquake was 38 km deep in the ground.

No one knows if there is damage yet. Iranian TV said that they have not heard of any damage.

A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause damage. But the nuclear plant is strong. It was built to be safe in big earthquakes.

An official said the Red Crescent Society checked the area. They did not find any damage. Village leaders and other people also checked. They found no damage. The official's name is Jahangir Dehqan.

Iran has many earthquakes. It is because Iran is on fault lines. Fault lines are cracks in the ground.

In 2003, there was a big earthquake in Bam. Bam is a city near Bushehr. The earthquake killed 26,000 people. The nuclear plant was not damaged then.

Iran has a nuclear program. In 2019, Iran said it would make more uranium. This was after the US left a deal in 2015. Donald Trump was the US leader then. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful things. They say it is not for weapons."
3,3_0,0,"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said.","The mangalica pig is from Hungary. It is almost 200 years old. An emperor made this pig breed.

Later, communists almost killed all these pigs. This pig has lived through hard times.

The mangalica is big and heavy. It has a coat like a sheep. It has the most hair and fat of all pigs.

Many people like this pig. They say it tastes very good.

About 30 years ago, there were almost no mangalica pigs. But now, they are back. They are on farms and tables in Hungary. People in Hungary love them again.

Recently, the mangalica is becoming popular around the world. It is in restaurants in the US and Japan. It has a lot of fat and looks like marble. People in Japan call it ""Kobe pork.""

In Hungary, the pig is a national treasure. This means it is very important to the country.

But now, the pig has a new problem. There is a disease called African swine fever. It is spreading in Eastern Europe. Many pigs are being killed because of this disease.

The mangalica is becoming more popular. This is causing problems with Hungary's neighbors.

Recently, a person from the US wrote about the mangalica online. He said it was from Romania a long time ago. Many people watched this video.

Hungary was angry. In the past, Hungary ruled part of Romania. Some people are still upset about this. The Hungarian news said, ""They took our land. Now they want to take our pig!""

Péter Tóth is the head of the Mangalica Breeders Association in Hungary. He said that this could be like hummus for Lebanon and Israel. They both say it is their food.

He also said that all mangalica pigs in Romania came from Hungary recently. But he said that the pig's story is from many countries."
3,3_1,1,"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic.","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

In the 1830s, someone made a new kind of pig. The emperor in Vienna got some fat, hairy pigs from Serbia. The emperor crossed them with Hungarian pigs. This happened near Arad, which is now in Romania.

A long time ago, many pigs in Hungary were mangalica pigs. Ninety percent of pigs were mangalica. People liked the fat on these pigs. The fat, called lard, could be stored for a long time. It was better than storing meat.

Then, people started using electricity. They used fridges to keep food cold. People did not need as much pig fat. The mangalica pig became a special, expensive food.

After the war, things got bad for the mangalica pig. The communist government almost killed them all. Only 300 female pigs were left. They were kept safe for science. You could not find the meat anywhere.

Tóth was a student. He studied animals in Spain in the 1990s. He told his friend about the fat Hungarian pigs. They started a project. They wanted to save the mangalica.

Tóth put ads in the newspaper. The ads said, ""If you see a mangalica, please tell me!"" He bought all the mangalica pigs he could find. He bred them with money from Spain. Then, he sent the fat pork to Spain. People in Spain made special meat from it.

Now, there are many mangalica farmers in Hungary. There are more than 200. You can buy the meat in markets. It costs more than normal pork. It costs about four times as much.

Zsóka Fekete has a mangalica farm. It is in eastern Hungary. She says the meat is special. It is different from other meat. The meat has lines of fat. This makes it taste good.

Zsóka used to work in a company. She worked in Budapest. In 2012, she went back to her family farm. She bought 20 female mangalica pigs. Now, she has 300 pigs.

People like her meat. Chefs from fancy restaurants buy her meat. People in Budapest wait in line to buy her meat. She goes to the city twice a month.

Now, there is a new problem for the mangalica pig. It is a disease called African swine fever. This could hurt the pigs."
3,3_2,2,"The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”","In Hungary, some wild pigs got sick in April. It was a virus. No farm pigs are sick yet. But the virus is easy to spread.

If a dead sick wild pig is found, all farm pigs near it must be killed. This is within two miles (3 kilometers).

This is bad for the Mangalica pig. These pigs live outside a lot. New rules are made to protect them. Farmers are putting up two fences. People cannot visit the farms now.

About 1,200 Mangalica pigs have been killed. This is more than ten percent of all Mangalica pigs in Hungary.

Mr. Tóth said the government will help. They will save the Mangalica pigs if the virus spreads more. They will keep the pigs' genes safe. They will move the best pigs to zoos or schools.

Some people worry about eating too much meat. This might not change things in Hungary soon. People eat a lot of pork. Not eating meat is strange for many.

But Mr. Tóth wants people to eat less meat. He does not like the way most farm animals are treated. He thinks the meat is not good.

He said people should eat less meat. But the meat should be good. He said people can eat one piece of Mangalica meat each week."
4,4_0,0,"The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years.

However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level, following your instructions:

**Part 1: India's Protests**

There are protests in India now. People are protesting about new rules for citizenship. These rules are in a law called the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The protests are good. They show that Indian democracy is strong. The people are speaking up, even if the politicians are not listening to the constitution.

India's constitution is important. People talked and worked on it for three years. They made it when India became free from British rule. They wanted to create a good country.

British rule in India was strange. The British were free, but they ruled India like a king.

In 1947, India became a free country. There was fighting at first. But India promised to be a fair and free country for everyone. This promise lasted for 70 years.

Now, India has problems with its constitution. This is because of a new law. Some people think this law is unfair. They think it goes against what the founders of India wanted. India is a big and diverse country. The constitution is very important for it.

**Part 2: Canada and Colonialism**

I read your story about the police in Canada. It is about the police and Indigenous people. It is a bad story. Thank you for sharing it.

But I want to say something about England. England is responsible for colonialism in Canada.

It started in 1670. England took land called Rupert's Land. They took it with a pen stroke. This land was used by the Hudson Bay Company. They took things from this land.

Everything about Canada today started with England. England got a lot of good things from colonialism in Canada.

Canada is responsible now. But your story does not say enough about England's responsibility."

5,5_0,0,"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family’s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian café, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at an A2 level, focusing on simple language and clear sentences:

**Food**

Brexit has been bad for restaurants. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union.

The British money, the pound, is weaker now. This means food from other countries is more expensive.

Also, people from Europe were not sure if they could stay in the UK. This made it hard for restaurants to find workers. Many workers from Europe work in restaurants.

The UK has now left the European Union. This happened at the end of January. But things might not get better for restaurants this year.

Restaurant owners say it is hard to keep workers from other countries. These workers are not sure about their future in the UK.

The food industry has the same problem. Many workers in food factories are from Eastern Europe.

If workers leave, companies need to pay more to keep them. Then, the companies have to charge customers more money. So, food will cost more in restaurants and shops.

Scientists are worried about the climate. They say we need to stop using more animals for food.

Some people are eating less meat. The shop Greggs now sells a vegan sausage roll (a sausage roll without meat).

More restaurants will offer vegetarian and vegan food this year. Vegan food has no animal products.

Maybe African food will become more popular. In London, there will be a new restaurant called Chuku’s. It will sell Nigerian food.

Also, William JM Chilila will open a restaurant called Akoko. It will have food from West Africa.

**Three People to Watch**

Nisha Katona used to be a lawyer. Now, she has Indian restaurants called Mowgli.

She learned to cook Indian food from her family. She started with one restaurant in Liverpool. Now, she has ten restaurants. She will open four more in 2020."
5,5_1,1,"Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.","**Daniel Humm**

Daniel Humm is an American chef. He is coming to Britain. He wants to be successful here. Many American chefs have come to Britain before. They wanted to be successful too.

Daniel Humm has three Michelin stars. He got them for his restaurant in New York. The restaurant is called Eleven Madison Park. Now, he has a new restaurant in London. It is in Claridge’s Hotel.

Before him, two other chefs had restaurants there. Their names are Simon Rogan and Gordon Ramsay. They were not very successful.

Daniel Humm hopes his restaurant will do well. It is called Davies and Brook. The name comes from two streets near the hotel.

**Will Beckett and Huw Gott**

Sometimes, things happen the other way. British chefs are also going to America.

Will Beckett and Huw Gott have a restaurant group. It is called Hawksmoor. It is very popular. They are opening a steakhouse in New York. This is a big step for them.

New York is famous for good steak. It will be interesting to see what New Yorkers think of the British steakhouse.

**Climate**

Next year, politicians will meet again. They will talk about the climate crisis. The climate crisis is a big problem for the world.

The meeting is on November 9. It will be in Glasgow. It is a UN meeting called COP26. The politicians will try to agree on ways to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon emissions make the Earth hotter.

Scientists say the Earth is already hotter. It is 1.1 degrees Celsius hotter than before. If we don't do anything, it could get 3 or 4 degrees hotter by the end of this century.

If the Earth gets too hot, bad things will happen. There will be big storms, and the sea will rise. Deserts will grow, and we will not have enough food. It will be very hot, and people will die.

In 2020, people will talk and plan for the Glasgow meeting. They want countries to promise to reduce carbon emissions. They also want to help poor countries deal with the climate crisis.

Poor countries say that rich countries caused most of the carbon emissions. They say rich countries need to do more to reduce emissions.

Poor countries also want money. They want rich countries to give them 100 billion dollars each year. This money will help them stop the bad effects of the climate crisis and reduce emissions. It has been hard to agree on these things."
5,5_2,2,"Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously – threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future. Temperatures also reached record highs in Australia, triggering continent-wide bushfires, while in Africa, the Victoria Falls – one of the planet’s greatest cascades of water – dried to a trickle in 2019. The Glasgow talks will take place against this grim, ecological background. Robin McKie Three to watch Greta Thunberg Can the activist maintain the momentum of the climate protest movement? Donald Trump He is pulling the US out of international climate agreements by 4 November, 2020.

Claire Perry O’Neill As president of COP26, it will be the principal job of the former Tory MP to ensure the talks are successful. Politics The UK’s membership of the European Union will be terminated at the end of January, but that’s not Brexit done. We then enter a transition period while there are tough and complex negotiations about the future relationship with our closest neighbours and most important trading partners. Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters. There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020. The SNP will demand it, but without any real conviction that it can get one from a Conservative government that has set an adamantine face against the idea. This refusal will suit the Nationalists.","Greenland has a lot of ice. This ice is melting very fast. It is melting seven times faster than in the 1990s.

The ice in West Antarctica is also melting. This is dangerous. The melting ice can make the sea level rise. If the sea level rises, countries like Bangladesh and islands in the Pacific Ocean will have problems.

Australia was very hot. The heat caused big fires all over the country.

In Africa, there is a big waterfall called Victoria Falls. In 2019, it had very little water. It almost dried up.

Important talks about the Earth will happen in Glasgow. These talks are called COP26. The talks are happening because the Earth is in trouble.

Here are some important people to watch:

*   **Greta Thunberg:** She is a young activist. She is trying to make people care about the Earth. Can she keep people interested in climate change?

*   **Donald Trump:** He is the President of the United States. He is taking the US out of climate agreements in November 2020. If he loses the election in November 2020, a new president could bring the US back to the talks in 2021.

*   **Claire Perry O’Neill:** She is in charge of the COP26 talks. Her job is to make sure the talks are successful.

The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. This will happen at the end of January. But that is not the end.

The UK and the EU need to talk about their future. It will be difficult. The UK wants to trade with the EU without paying money. The EU may not agree.

Boris Johnson is the leader of the UK. He says the UK will leave the EU without a deal if they cannot agree. This could hurt the UK economy.

Scotland wants to have another vote about leaving the UK. The government does not want them to have this vote. Scotland will probably not have a vote in 2020."
5,5_3,3,"Current polling suggests that they can’t be confident of winning a referendum now, and a second defeat would surely kill their ambition for a long time. The SNP’s true aim is to stoke Scottish resentment against Westminster to pave the way for a big win in the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That’s the year with the potential for a constitutional car crash that rips apart the kingdom. Both the Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the latter contest, which is expected to climax around March. Expect bitter rows about the election process as the Corbynites who control the party’s national executive committee try to fix the terms of the battle to favour their continuity candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey. Labour moderates are already saying that the succession of a beardless variation of Jeremy Corbyn will doom Labour to another decade in opposition. If that happens, the moderates will be asking whether the party is dead to them and they should try something different.

**Original Text Rewritten:**

People think that they may not win a vote now. If they lose again, they will not try for a long time.

The SNP wants to make people in Scotland angry at the government in London. They want to win a big election in Scotland in 2021. That year could be a bad time for the UK. It could break the country apart.

Two parties, the Lib Dems and Labour, will get new leaders. People will watch the Labour party closely. The election for their leader will probably end around March.

There will be problems with the election. Some people in the Labour party want their friend, Rebecca Long Bailey, to win.

Other people in the Labour party think that if someone like Jeremy Corbyn wins, Labour will lose for ten more years. If this happens, they may leave the party. They might want to do something else.

**People to Watch:**

*   **Boris Johnson:** He said he will do many things about Brexit, the NHS, and money for the north. Can he do what he promised? Or will he have problems in 2020?

*   **Nicola Sturgeon:** She won a big election in Scotland in December 2019. Everyone will watch her. Can she use her popularity to try to make Scotland independent?

*   **Rebecca Long Bailey:** It will be hard for her to become the Labour leader. Many people want the job. Will people vote for her because she is like Corbyn? Or will they want someone new?

Another play is coming back. It is called ""Talking Heads"". Alan Bennett wrote it. It will be at the Watford Palace Theatre. Jan Ravens and Julia Watson will be in it.

The musical ""Carousel"" is coming to London. It is by Rodgers and Hammerstein. You can see it in the summer. It will be at Regent's Park Theatre, which is outside.

It is Beethoven's 250th birthday! Sir Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra will play his seventh symphony. This is on January 15. His opera ""Fidelio"" will be at Covent Garden in March. Jonas Kaufmann will sing in it.

There will be an art show with Gauguin and other artists. These artists are called Impressionists. You can see it at the Royal Academy from the end of March. There will be paintings by Pissarro, Monet, Manet, and Degas. Some of these paintings have not been seen before.

The British Museum has a new show too. It is called ""Living with art: Picasso to Celmins"". It starts in January. It will travel around the country later. The show has art that Alexander Walker gave to the museum. He was a film critic. One of the best things to see is a picture by David Hockney called ""Jungle Boy"".

Two British movies are coming out in January. One is called ""1917"". Sam Mendes made it. The other is called ""The Personal History of David Copperfield"". Armando Iannucci made it. The new James Bond movie, ""No Time to Die"", will be out in April.

Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew’s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein’s alleged victims’ lawyers’ relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future.

The Queen will be 94 in April. She seems lonely. Prince Philip, her husband, will be 99 in June.

He lives mostly alone. He stays on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

Some family members have made decisions. These decisions make people ask questions. Are they asking the Queen for her opinion? Some people may want to do what they want.

Prince Andrew did an interview on TV. It was with Emily Maitlis from Newsnight. The interview was very surprising. People learned about a Pizza Express in Woking. They also looked up medical problems.

The interview did not help Prince Andrew. People are still talking about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was a bad man.

Lawyers for Epstein's victims want Prince Andrew in court. They want to ask him questions. This problem will continue. Prince Andrew has stopped working for the public for now.

6,6_0,0,"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","Mark Carney is leaving his job at the Bank of England. He talked about companies that use oil, gas, and coal. He said these companies must explain why they still use these fuels.

He said that oil, gas, and coal could become useless in the future. He talked to a radio program called ""Today.""

Greta Thunberg helped to make the radio program. She cares a lot about climate change. Mark Carney said that banks and companies are starting to use less oil and gas. But he said they need to do it faster.

After he leaves his job, Mark Carney will work for the United Nations. He will help with climate change and money. He said the climate crisis is a big problem coming soon. He said we will have more very bad weather.

He said it will be too late if we wait until the weather gets very bad. He said leaders need to start working on the problem now. He talked about people investing money in oil, gas, and coal companies.

He said these people need to think about their money. They need to explain why they invest in these companies. He said these things could become worthless.

He said we cannot burn all the oil, gas, and coal. If we do, we cannot reach our climate goals. A lot of coal and oil could become useless. He asked companies, banks, and others what their plans are.

The Bank of England said that $20 trillion could become worthless. This could happen if companies do not change to using less oil, gas, and coal."
6,6_1,1,"In his interview, Carney urged climate change deniers to drop their opposition on the issue, saying: “We can’t afford on this one to have selective information, spin, misdirection.” One such sceptic is the former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore, who guest-edited Today on Saturday and included in his programme a feature questioning the global consensus on the climate crisis. Complaining about how much internal opposition there had been to this item being included, Moore accused the BBC of “climate change alarmism”.","Here is the rewritten text in CEFR A2 level English:

Charles Moore does not believe in climate change. He used to work for a newspaper. He was in charge of a BBC radio show. In the show, he asked questions about climate change. He said many people agree about climate change. He did not agree with them.

Moore said it was hard to put his ideas on the radio show. He said the BBC worries too much about climate change. He called this ""climate change alarmism""."
7,7_0,0,"A man who was shot dead in central Moscow after opening fire on the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s main intelligence agency building, in an attack that killed two has been identified as a gun enthusiast. Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.","A man shot a gun in Moscow. It was near the building of the FSB. The FSB is a big Russian intelligence agency. Two people died in the shooting.

The man who shot the gun is Yevgeny Manyurov. He was 39 years old. He was from a town near Moscow. People say he liked guns a lot.

He shot at the FSB building on Thursday night. He used a fast gun called an automatic weapon. He shot at the windows. One FSB worker died.

On Friday night, another FSB officer died in the hospital. He was hurt in the shooting. One more FSB officer was badly hurt. Three other people were also hurt.

The FSB shot and killed Manyurov. He had bombs in his bag. He did not get inside the FSB building. The building used to be the office of the KGB. The KGB was a secret police from the time of the Soviet Union.

News stories say Manyurov lived alone with his mother. They say he liked guns very much. He did not have a job. He used to work as a guard. He worked at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow.

Recently, he was in a shooting contest. He got third place. The contest was run by a sports group. Vladimir Putin started the group again in 2009. Putin is the president of Russia.

Police found guns in his house. He had two rifles and two shotguns. He owned the guns legally. He used a Kalashnikov rifle in the shooting.

Oleg Solovich taught Manyurov how to shoot. He said Manyurov was not a good shooter. He said Manyurov wore a long coat when he shot. Solovich told him to take off the coat, but Manyurov did not want to."
7,7_1,1,"The motive for the attack remains unclear, although Kommersant, a daily newspaper, reported that witnesses told investigators he was shouting slogans “typical of Islamic State”. “I noticed he had been somewhat agitated lately,” Baza, a media outlet with links to the security services, cited his mother as saying. She said he was unmarried, with no children or close friends, and that he was passionate about guns. He appears to have had no social media presence. The assault on the FSB office took place shortly after Putin’s annual press conference in Moscow. The president was attending a gala concert at the nearby Kremlin in honour of the security services during the shootout. The attack may have been planned to coincide with the speech, an FSB source told Reuters. Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process.","Here is the rewritten text in CEFR A2 level English:

We do not know why the attack happened. A newspaper said people heard the attacker shouting. The words were like things people from Islamic State say.

A media group talked to the attacker's mother. She said he seemed worried recently. He was not married. He had no children or close friends. He liked guns a lot. He did not use social media.

The attack was at an office. The office belongs to the FSB. This happened after Putin spoke to the press in Moscow.

Putin was at a concert near the Kremlin. The concert was for the security services. The attack might have been planned for the same time as Putin's speech. Someone from the FSB told this to Reuters.

A news website said the police kept shooting. They shot for some time after the attacker died. A person walking by might have been hurt."
8,8_0,0,"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries. A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration.","The Green party in Austria may soon be in the government. This is the first time for them. They made a deal with the conservative party. Sebastian Kurz leads this party. He will probably be the leader of Austria again.

The Green party will be a small part of the government. The Austrian People's party (ÖVP) is the bigger part. Before, another party was in the government. It was the Freedom party. But their leaders had problems with a scandal. People did not vote for them after that.

Kurz's party and the Green party did well in the last election. Kurz's party got the most votes with 37%. The Green party got their best result ever.

The parties talked for many months. Then, they made a deal on Saturday. Kurz said he thinks they can make a government together. The Green leader is Werner Kogler. He said they solved big problems. He will probably be the second leader of Austria.

The Green party members need to agree to the deal. They will vote on Saturday. If they say yes, the new government can start soon. It could start on January 7. The leader of Austria, Alexander Van der Bellen, will make it official.

People in other countries are watching this. In Switzerland, the Green party also did well in elections. They want to change how the government works. They want the Green party to have more power.

In Germany, the Green party and Angela Merkel's party are popular. They will have elections in 2021. A newspaper in Germany said that good things are happening in Austria. They said it is a new start with two parties that like Europe. These parties won the last elections.

Kurz's party will have more power in the new government. They will probably lead important parts. They will lead the country and control money. They will also be in charge of the police, foreign countries, and the army. There will be a new part of the government for immigration. Kurz wants to continue his strict rules about people coming to Austria."
8,8_1,1,"It will be run by his confidante Susanne Raab, who worked on the country’s 2017 ban on full-face veils and a 2015 law designed to curb “political Islam”. The Green party will aim to exercise the most influence through a boosted ministry for infrastructure, transport and environment, expected to be headed by the former climate activist Leonore Gewessler. Green politicians in charge of the justice and culture portfolios will hope to curb the more authoritarian tendencies of Kurz’s ÖVP. In the final stretch of negotiations, Austria’s constitutional court ruled that some of the policies proposed by the conservatives – such as expanded surveillance measures or making social benefits conditional on command of the German language – would violate the constitution. “The Greens’ main aim [during coalition talks] has been to get major concessions on protecting the climate,” said Der Standard newspaper, commenting that the deal with the conservatives was as likely to please environmentalists as to frustrate leftwingers in the party. “With everything else, damage limitation will have to do.”","Okay, here's the rewritten text at an A2 level, following your instructions:

Susanne Raab will manage it. She is a close friend of his. She helped with the law about face veils in 2017. This law stopped people from covering their faces completely. She also worked on a law in 2015. This law tried to limit ""political Islam.""

The Green party wants more power. They will use the ministry for transport and the environment. This ministry will be bigger. Leonore Gewessler will probably lead it. She used to be a climate activist.

Green politicians will be in charge of justice and culture. They want to stop the ÖVP from being too strict. Kurz's party, ÖVP, can be authoritarian.

Before the deal, the court made a decision. The court said some ideas from the conservatives were not okay. These ideas included more surveillance. They also wanted people to speak German to get money from the government. The court said this was against the rules.

The newspaper *Der Standard* wrote about the Green party. They said the Greens wanted to protect the climate. This was their main goal. The newspaper said that some people in the Green party might be unhappy with the deal. It might make environmentalists happy. The newspaper said, ""They will have to try to limit the damage."" This means they have to accept some bad things."
9,9_0,0,"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes. CGT union workers also voted to halt production at Total’s Grandpuits refinery.","French train workers are on strike. They are angry about changes to their pensions.

The workers had a protest in Paris. They met the police there. The police wore helmets and shields.

The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, asked them to stop the strike for Christmas. But the workers did not stop.

Many workers met outside a train station called Gare de Lyon. Many people use this station to go south for the holidays. Some people go to ski in the Alps. Many trains were cancelled.

The workers talked about the government's plan for pensions. They said they will continue the strike over Christmas and New Year.

Some people used fireworks at the station. The police stood near the ticket gates.

The train strike has been for 19 days. The train company said it is very difficult for travelers.

Most workers did not listen to the President. People waited in lines to buy tickets for the few trains that were running.

Some trains did not go all the way. Some trains were replaced with buses.

Almost half of the people with tickets could not travel by train. They had to find other ways to travel. Some people shared cars. Some people rented cars.

It was also hard to travel on the Paris metro. There were many people at Gare du Nord station. They wanted to take trains to the suburbs.

Some people needed to go to the airport. It was hard to find a taxi. Some taxi drivers charged more money because of traffic.

People were worried about how to go home after Christmas. The strike will continue in January.

Also, workers at an oil place in the south of France stopped working. They are also protesting about the pensions. They make a lot of oil there every day. Workers at another oil place stopped working too."
9,9_1,1,"Emmanuel Lepine, the secretary general of the CGT’s oil branch, told France Info radio that CGT workers at other refineries in France could also vote to halt production. “We gave an ultimatum to the government, it didn’t listen, so we’re doing exactly what we promised,” Lepine said. “What we are demanding is the withdrawal of the reform.” State officials have begun preparing for another round of union negotiations in the coming weeks before a further national day of protests on 9 January. The government has insisted it will push ahead with attempts to unify the French pension system, arguing that removing 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Opéra de Paris staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any age-related changes. Unions are angry at government plans to introduce a “pivot age” – keeping the legal retirement age at 62 but insisting on an additional two years of work to receive a full pension.","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

Emmanuel Lepine works for the CGT oil group. He spoke on the radio. He said workers at other oil places in France might stop working. They can vote to stop making oil.

Lepine said they told the government what they wanted. The government did not listen. So, they are doing what they said they would do. They want the government to stop the new plan.

The government is getting ready to talk to the unions again. They will talk in the next few weeks. There will be another big protest on January 9.

The government wants to change the pension system. They want one system for everyone. Now, there are 42 different systems. These are for people like train workers, energy workers, lawyers, and opera workers. The government says this change is important. It will help the pension system work when more people are old.

Some unions like the idea of one system. But, almost all unions do not want any changes to the age people retire.

The unions are angry. The government wants a ""pivot age."" This means people can retire at 62. But, they must work two more years to get all their pension money."

From a cocktail-making contest to a MasterChef-inspired cook-off, the Guardian spoke to four people about their plans for New Year’s Eve. ‘I think he’s making a daiquiri but he’s not very good’ “I’ll be making a raspberry mojito,” said Elinor, speaking of the cocktail-making contest she and her partner, Richard, both 32, have planned for Thursday night. “I think he’s making a daiquiri, but he’s not very good,” she added. Elinor, who works as an engineer in Glasgow, said the idea came to them as they drew suggestions from a hat. Both of them will also be attending an organised online murder mystery event. “We’ve done one before and they work quite well – you go into Zoom rooms to be questioned then come back together and watch the scenes play out,” she said. “In Scotland we have a tradition to ‘first foot’, which means being someone’s first visitor after midnight – normally bearing gifts such as shortbread and whisky. You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick. It’s horrifying at the moment.” ‘We’ve got to be optimistic’ In Preston, Janet and her husband, now both retired, have got together with neighbours every year for the last 18 years for a Christmas party. Coronavirus has prevented them celebrating this year but they are determined to see in 2021 together.

11,11_0,0,"In Sydney the fireworks soared into the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour below was empty. In New York, Times Square was mostly deserted. No light show illuminated Beijing from the top of the TV tower. With revelry around the world curtailed by lockdowns and curfews imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19, the lions of London’s Trafalgar Square were barricaded off, and there were no crowds in St Peter’s Square and no one diving into the Tiber in Rome. This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget – one that has seen more than 1.7 million people killed and 82 million infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, whose pyrotechnic display has in the past drawn crowds of a million people to the city’s harbour area, rang in 2021 with a shortened display, with most popular observation spots fenced off and a heavy police presence deterring visitors. Only people who had restaurant reservations or were one of five guests of an inner-city resident were allowed in. “What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands gathered at popular spots across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but were not particularly worried. In New Zealand, too, which has managed to eliminate coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year’s Eve plans proceeded as usual. In Germany, however, where the sale of fireworks has been banned to discourage crowds and authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”, Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final new year’s address as chancellor that she had never found the old year so heavy.","In Sydney, fireworks went up in the sky. They were above the Opera House. But the harbour below was empty. No one was there.

In New York, Times Square was empty too. Almost no one was there. In Beijing, there was no light show. It usually happens on top of the TV tower.

There were not many parties around the world. This was because of rules to stop the virus. London’s Trafalgar Square had fences around it. No one was in St Peter’s Square in Rome. No one swam in the Tiber river.

This New Year’s Eve was different. Many people said goodbye to the old year. They wanted to forget it. The year had a lot of problems. More than 1.7 million people died. 82 million people got sick from the virus since January.

Sydney usually has many people for the fireworks. One million people come to the harbour. But this year, the show was shorter. Most places to watch were closed. There were many police to keep people away. Only people with restaurant bookings could come. People who lived there could also have five guests.

The leader of New South Wales said it was a very bad year. She hopes 2021 will be better.

In Wuhan, China, the virus started last year. Thousands of people met in the city centre. They waited for the New Year. Some were careful. But they were not very worried.

New Zealand stopped the virus with a long lockdown. New Year’s Eve there was normal.

In Germany, they stopped selling fireworks. This was to stop crowds. In Berlin, police said they would punish people who break the rules. Angela Merkel spoke about the year. It was her last New Year speech as leader. She said the old year was very hard."

She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve.","Angela Merkel spoke about the new year. She said that even with problems, she has much hope for the new year. She is a scientist. People liked how she helped with the virus at first. But now, some people don't like her because many people are sick and dying.

She does not like people who protest against the rules. She also does not like people who believe false things about the vaccine. She said it must be hard for people who lost family members to the virus. It must be hard when others say the virus is not real.

Jens Spahn is the health minister. He thinks this New Year's Eve will be very quiet.

In France, only six adults can be together for dinner. Many police will stop people from celebrating in public. People cannot buy alcohol in some places. The police will make sure people stay home between 8 pm and 6 am. This is to stop parties and problems.

In Britain, many people died on Thursday. This is because of a new type of the virus. People who want to celebrate New Year's Eve must wait. They need to have parties later in 2021. ""Covid loves a crowd,"" they say.

Stephen Powis works for the NHS. He said that staying home will help. It will help stop the virus and help hospitals. He said it is important to stay home this year and follow the rules.

Boris Johnson is the prime minister. He also asked people to follow the rules. He wants people to stay home and be safe.

There are fences in some public places in London. This is to stop people from gathering.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility. In New York, the New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway but in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said.","Pope Francis could not lead the New Year services. He has a problem with his leg. It is called sciatica. The Vatican said this.

Vladimir Putin is the president of Russia. He spoke on New Year's Eve. He said he hopes Russians will work together. Russia is fighting the virus.

The virus is making many people sick. Putin said the virus is not gone. He said the fight against the virus is still happening.

Many doctors and nurses will work tonight. Putin said we need to be careful.

In New York, there is a New Year's Eve ball. The ball will drop in Broadway. But there will not be many people.

Usually, many people come to Times Square. This year, only some people can come. They are nurses, doctors, and other important workers. Their families can come too.

Everyone will stay far apart. This is to stop the virus from spreading.

The police closed the square. Cars and people cannot go there. This is because of the virus. The police will tell people to leave if they come. The area is called a ""frozen zone.""

The police chief said you cannot watch the ball there."
12,12_0,0,"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","It was a hard year for many people. The elephants at Elefanjoy in India also had a hard time.

In March, there was a big problem. The country closed down because of a sickness. The elephants could not walk.

They usually walk 30 miles every day. This is good for their legs and helps them eat. Because they could not walk, they got sick. They were also sad.

The people who worked there were also sad. Ankit Pareek takes care of the elephants. He said the elephants felt the sadness of the people.

The elephants were sad because they missed the tourists. Tourists used to walk with them. They washed the elephants and played with them. Tourists also took pictures with the elephants.

Ankit was worried about the elephants. He needed money to feed them. He got money from tourists.

Elephants eat a lot. They eat about 200 kg of food every day. It costs a lot of money to feed each elephant. It costs about 5,000 rupees every day. That is like 51 pounds.

Ankit did not want the elephants to be hungry. He took money from the bank. He used this money to buy food.

Ankit said he loves the elephants. He has lived with them since he was a child. He said it will be bad if tourists do not come back soon.

Some people say that using elephants for tourists is bad. They say it is not kind to the elephants.

In India and Thailand, many tourists like to ride elephants. This makes a lot of money. But now there are no tourists. This is a new problem for the elephants.

Some people hope this will stop the problem. They hope that people will stop using elephants for tourism.

In September, four elephants died. They carried tourists up to a fort. They were tied up all day. They did not have enough food or water. This made them very sick and they died.

Varda Mehrotra works for an animal group. She said the elephants in India are not treated well."
12,12_1,1,"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","COVID-19 has made many problems worse. We have talked about these problems for years. Now, elephants are dying.

Mehrotra said there is a big problem. There are only a few elephant places in India. These places cannot take care of more elephants. Many elephants are not working now. They are hungry.

In India, some people own elephants. These elephants help them make money. They work in Hindu festivals called pujas. They also work in weddings. But now, these events are not happening because of COVID-19.

The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave money to elephant owners. This was during the lockdown. But now, they don't give money anymore. Other states did not give any money at all.

Hareshbabu Rengan is 37 years old. His family in Tamil Nadu has two elephants. They are 40 years old. Their names are Lakshmi and Kusma. Hareshbabu is using social media to ask for money. He wants to help his elephants and other elephants too.

He said he is worried about elephants in India. People don't want to say they need money for their elephants. They are afraid of problems.

In Thailand, there are many elephants in tourist camps. About 2,000 elephants are in these camps. Now, people are leaving these elephants.

The government helped a little. They gave grass and hay for the elephants. But some camps had to close.

Many elephants left the camps in Thailand. About 1,000 elephants walked back to their owners' villages. These villages are their birthplaces. They have not been there for many years.

In March, three elephants came to Elephant Nature Park. The park is in Chiang Mai. The elephants' names are Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah.

Their handler asked if he could stay at the park for a short time. In the morning, he was gone. He called later. He said he could not take care of the elephants. He did not have enough money.

Sangdeaun runs the Elephant Nature Park. She said people sometimes leave dogs and cats at the clinic. Now, they are leaving elephants too."
12,12_2,2,"Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, the president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said the number of callers asking for veterinary assistance had grown since March. Patitta Traiwet, the president of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has branches across Thailand, said she had managed to maintain the animals’ routine but the elephants had noticed the absence of tourists lining up to give them bananas and pineapples. “They were confused at the beginning – where are the people? Why is nobody feeding me banana?” she said. Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth. Many people now hope that even when the tourists return, these elephants will remain resettled in their natural habitat for good. Additional reporting by Navaon Siradapuvadol","She has a place for elephants. It has 97 elephants. Most of them are old. They are not working anymore. They came from places where people rode them.

It is a difficult time now. Elephants in Thailand cost less money. Sangdeaun said that before, a baby elephant cost $100,000. Now, it costs only $40,000.

She is worried. Families may not be able to keep their elephants. These families have cared for elephants for many years. They might sell the elephants to big companies for little money.

Elephants in camps in Thailand are often in chains. They are sad. They get angry and fight each other. Sangdeaun said this happens because they are sad and angry.

Some camps have fewer people working there. So, the elephants do not get the care they need.

Theerapat Trungprakan helps elephants. He said more people are calling him for help with sick elephants. This started in March.

Patitta Traiwet also helps elephants. She has elephant places in Thailand. She is still doing the same things for the elephants. But the elephants see that there are no tourists. The tourists used to give them food. The elephants are confused. They ask, ""Where are the people? Why are they not giving me bananas?""

But many elephants went home with their keepers. They can now play in the jungle and rivers. This is where they were born.

Some people hope the elephants can stay in the jungle. They hope this will happen even when the tourists come back.

13,13_0,0,"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

There is a new type of Covid-19 virus in the UK. It spreads fast. Scientists think this new type is easier to pass to other people.

This idea is stronger now. New research shows this type has more virus in people's bodies. This makes it easier to spread.

The new type is called B117. Scientists found it because cases in Kent were going up. This happened even when people stayed home in November. Old types of the virus were going down, but B117 kept spreading.

Some labs started to see the new type in samples. These labs test for Covid-19. They are in places like London and Manchester.

Scientists in the UK warned about B117. They said it was easy to spread.

Dr. Michael Kidd and his team looked at many samples. The samples were from people who felt sick. They found B117 and other types of the virus.

About 35% of people with B117 had a lot of virus in their bodies. Only 10% of people without B117 had a lot of virus. This is what the scientists found in their study. Other scientists still need to check the study.

Dr. Kidd said that people with B117 have more virus. He thinks it is easier for them to give it to others. But he said they need more information. They need more proof.

Scientists are very sure that B117 is easy to spread. Some scientists think it spreads 56% faster than old types.

There are many reasons why B117 might spread fast. Maybe people need less virus to get sick. Maybe the virus grows fast in people's bodies. Or maybe people are sick for a longer time. If so, they can give the virus to more people.

Dr. Kidd said it is important to know why B117 has more virus. They need to do more tests in the lab. This will help them understand why it is easy to spread."
13,13_1,1,"“Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death. But a higher rate of transmissibility without strict controls could still lead to more death. • This article was corrected on 30 December 2020. The higher viral load was found in respiratory samples, not blood samples as an earlier version stated.","We need more proof, like pieces in a puzzle. This study is important. But it is just a first look. We need to do it again. It helps us understand why the virus spreads easily. People with the virus can give it to others more easily.

Early information says the UK virus does not make people more sick. It does not mean you will get sick again. It does not mean you will die more often.

But the virus spreads faster. If we are not careful, more people could die.

This article was changed on December 30, 2020. The virus was found in the nose and mouth. It was not found in the blood, like we said before."
14,14_0,0,"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Hospitals may have to make very difficult choices soon. They may have to decide which patients get important treatment for Covid-19. This is because the NHS is very busy. Doctors are worried about this.

People are asking for a new lockdown in the UK. They also want schools to open later after Christmas. They want schools to open one month later. This can help stop the virus from spreading.

The health service is having problems. There are many people with Covid-19. Some patients might not get a bed in the intensive care unit. Some patients might not get a machine to help them breathe.

The government needs to do more to stop Covid-19. Matt Hancock will talk to the Members of Parliament (MPs) on Wednesday. He will talk about the tier system in England. The tier system has rules about what people can do. He will say if the rules are working to stop the virus.

He might say there will be a new tier 5 in England. Tier 5 will be stricter than tier 4. London and other areas are already in tier 4. The government wants to stop the virus from spreading quickly. On Tuesday, there were a record number of new cases: 53,135. Scotland already has five tiers.

More and more hospitals are becoming full. Many patients need emergency care because of Covid-19. In London, some hospitals are very full. Doctors have asked for patients to be moved to Yorkshire. Yorkshire is far away. This will help the hospitals in London.

One hospital in London is called the Royal Free hospital. It will move the children's hospital to another place. This will make more space for adults. The adults have Covid-19 or other illnesses. The hospital will also use a unit at Barnet general hospital for Covid-19 patients. Staff were told this in an email on Tuesday."
14,14_1,1,"A senior manager at the trust, which now has 424 inpatients with Covid, said: “London Gold call has indicated that this position is expected to escalate for the next two weeks with 4 January potentially the zenith of critical care capacity needed.” The Independent Sage committee of scientific and medical experts is urging ministers to instigate an immediate further UK-wide lockdown to try to prevent an imminent “catastrophe”. Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action. Referring to the Tiers review, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: “It will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people to the highest level.” A toughening is needed urgently because pressures on the NHS in some places is “rising at an unsustainable rate”, she said. Keir Starmer sounded a stark warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian that the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January. Dr Claudia Paoloni, a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS and president of the HCSA, said ICU staff may end up having to in effect ration who received care that could help them survive. “Our NHS just doesn’t have the beds to cope. Some areas will be overwhelmed in days. If ventilation capacity is exceeded, horrendous choices will have to be made over those who live and die.","A manager at the hospital trust spoke. The hospital has 424 patients with Covid now. He said the situation will get worse in the next two weeks. He thinks January 4th will be the worst day for the need of special care in hospitals.

A group of scientists and doctors called Independent Sage also spoke. They want the government to start a lockdown in the UK now. This can stop a very bad situation from happening soon. They said that if the government waits, many people will die. These people could be saved if the government acts now.

Sir David King leads this group. He used to be the government's chief scientist. The group said schools should stay closed until February. Schools will open next week. But this could make the situation worse. There is a new type of the virus. It spreads more easily. It seems to infect young people more easily too.

Christina Pagel is a member of Independent Sage. She said things are very bad now. She said they will get worse. She said we need to act now. This will stop the hospitals from failing in a few weeks. She said the situation is very serious.

NHS Providers also spoke. This group represents hospitals in England. They want the government to take stronger action. Saffron Cordery works for NHS Providers. She said the government will need to make hard choices. She said they will need to move many more people to the highest level of rules. She said this is needed now. The hospitals are under a lot of pressure. The pressure is growing too fast in some places.

Keir Starmer is a leader. He warned about the problems facing the hospitals and schools next month. He told the newspaper that the UK is facing another lockdown in January.

Dr Claudia Paoloni also spoke. She is a doctor in the hospital. She said there may not be enough beds in the special care units. She said doctors may need to choose who gets the care that can help them live. She said the hospitals do not have enough beds. She said some areas will be in a very bad situation soon. If there are not enough machines to help people breathe, very hard choices will need to be made. They will have to choose who lives and who dies."
14,14_2,2,"“The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days.","Here's the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level:

The doctor said hospitals will have to make hard choices. They must choose which patients can go to intensive care. Some patients may only get some care, not intensive care.

It is hard when someone in intensive care is not getting better. Doctors must decide how long to keep trying. If someone else needs a machine, like for blood cleaning, they must decide who gets it. There are not many machines. It is also hard to decide who gets a bed with breathing help. All the beds might be full.

The doctor also said hospitals might stop other care. This includes cancer surgery. The NHS said they would try to keep doing this. But it might not be possible.

A hospital might ask: Can we do cancer surgery today? We have only a few beds. We have no extra beds for emergencies. If we use the last bed for surgery, what if there is an emergency?

Checking for diseases like cancer may also stop. People may wait longer for an ambulance when they call 999.

The NHS is in a very bad situation. It is the worst in 72 years. Some hospitals might use tents outside. They will check patients in the tents.

There are long lines of ambulances outside hospitals. Patients wait in the ambulances for hours. They are waiting to go inside.

On Tuesday, ambulances were in line at hospitals. Some hospitals were in London. One was in Birmingham.

A doctor said the tent plan is like after a big problem. It is like after a bomb or a big accident. The doctor works in the emergency room.

NHS workers are ready for more people with COVID. The number of people with the virus is going up. The doctor said it will get worse in the next few weeks.

The doctor wants the government to make a plan. The plan should help with the problems in the hospitals.

Another group of doctors said COVID has made the NHS much more stressed. The situation has gotten much worse in the last few days."
14,14_3,3,"The organisation’s president, Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, said: “The NHS in the south-east is in meltdown. ICUs in the south-east are overflowing, with doctors telling us that their hospitals are running out of non-invasive ventilators and even basics like oxygen.” Richard Mitchell, chief executive of the Sherwood Forest group of hospitals in Nottinghamshire, tweeted that: “Today will be a difficult day, tomorrow may be tougher and the next couple of weeks are likely to be the busiest and most challenging we have ever faced in the NHS.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “There is no shortage of ventilators and we have enough oxygen to meet demand. “Throughout this global pandemic we have done whatever it takes to protect the NHS and save lives, including ensuring everyone who needed a ventilator had access to one.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

Dr. Samantha Batt-Rawden is the president of an organization. She said the NHS in the south-east is in big trouble. Hospitals there are very full. Doctors say they don't have enough ventilators. Ventilators help people breathe. The hospitals also need more oxygen. Oxygen is needed to help people.

Richard Mitchell works at hospitals in Nottinghamshire. He said today will be hard. Tomorrow will be even harder. The next few weeks will be very busy. He thinks they will be the hardest weeks ever for the NHS.

The Department of Health and Social Care said something different. They said there are enough ventilators. They also said they have enough oxygen for everyone. They said they are helping the NHS. They want to save lives during the pandemic. They are making sure everyone who needs a ventilator can get one."

The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango.","During the pandemic, technology helped us a lot. It helped us keep our jobs and feel better. But in Barcelona, the lockdowns did something else. They helped books become popular again. Books are a very old and simple invention.

Bookshops in Barcelona are selling many books. Some new bookshops have even opened. One new shop is called Llibreria Byron. It was started by a small company called Huygens. The shop opened in November in Sant Antoni.

Mariana Sarrias owns the shop with someone else. She said they planned to open in April. But they could not because of the pandemic. They waited for nine months. They were worried because they had spent a lot of money. They named the shop Byron after a writer. He was romantic and different.

When they opened in November, many people were waiting. The shop was full. Mariana said it was very emotional. People come to the shop every day. She does not know why. Maybe people want to help them. Or maybe the area needed a bookshop.

Maria Carme Ferrer is the head of the booksellers' group. She said people want to help local bookshops because of the pandemic. She thinks bookshops are important places for culture.

Mariana said her company sold more books during the lockdown. Maybe people were bored of watching TV. Or maybe people felt lonely and books were good friends.

A few years ago, bookshops were not doing well. In 2013, a famous bookshop called Catalonia closed. It had been open since 1924. A McDonald’s is there now. In the same year, another bookshop called Canuda closed. It was a big, old shop. It inspired a book called ""The Shadow of the Wind."" Now a clothing store is in that place. The clothing store is called Mango."
15,15_1,1,"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","Maybe this comes as no surprise. This city is the capital of Spanish books. The people of Catalonia love books. Every year, on April 23, they celebrate this love. April 23 is the birthday of Sant Jordi (Saint George). It is also Shakespeare's birthday!

On this day, people give books and roses to each other. The streets have many small book shops for this day. This year, the virus stopped the Sant Jordi celebration. It will probably be small in 2021. This is according to Lluís Morral. He is the manager of Laie. Laie is a very popular bookshop in the city.

Morral says that book sales have gone up. This happened when people stayed home. People are buying old, famous books. They are not buying the newest books. He said that many people are reading again. They want to read books they planned to read before.

He said people buy books on Sant Jordi. But they do not read them. Now, they know they have books at home. So they are reading them. He agrees with Sarrias. He thinks staying at home made people read. They saw that books are good friends.

Morral said that many people got tired of watching TV. Laie and Byron are bookshops with cafes. They have quiet places for reading. This is important because this city is very loud. It is the loudest city in Europe!

Two new shops are opening. Ona sells books in the Catalan language. Finestres will open soon. These shops want to be places to meet and read. People can also buy books there. Rich people from the city helped to pay for these shops. Morral hopes they do well.

But he knows it will be hard. All small bookshops must compete with Amazon. Amazon is a big online store. Morral said that small bookshops can help people more. They can understand what books you like. They can suggest books you might enjoy. Amazon only uses a computer to tell you what to read."
16,16_0,0,"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said.","The government of France is getting criticism. Some people think they are trying to please people who do not want the vaccine.

The vaccine program started in France a few days ago. But not many people have had the vaccine.

Health workers in France say they are going slowly. They say it is a long race, not a fast one.

One reason they are going slowly is that many people in France do not trust the vaccine.

A survey said that only 40% of people in France want to get the vaccine. This number was higher in October. Then, more than half of the people in France wanted the vaccine.

In Britain, 77% of people want the vaccine. In the United States, 69% of people want it.

France started giving the vaccine on Sunday. It is the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The first people to get it were workers and people living in care homes. They also gave it to people who are more likely to get very sick.

France is the only country that wants people to write down that they agree to get the vaccine. They must agree after someone tells them about possible problems.

But in the first three days, not many people got the vaccine. Less than 100 people got it. By Wednesday evening, 332 people had the vaccine. This information comes from health officials.

The health ministry wants to give the vaccine to one million older people and people at risk in January. They need to give more than 31,200 vaccines every day to do this.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, said France is giving the vaccine slower than other countries. He said this is on purpose. He wants to give people information about the vaccine first. He said it is not because they do not have enough vaccines or have problems getting them to people.

Véran said that France has the same amount of vaccine as Germany. He said they have the same goals and will have the same results.

He also said that it takes time to start. He said that going fast is not the same as rushing.

The president, Emmanuel Macron, and his ministers said the vaccine is not required. They said they will not make a list of people who do not want the vaccine.

But Macron said people should listen to science. He said to trust the scientists and doctors."
16,16_1,1,"In his new year address on Thursday, Macron vowed to avoid “unjustifiable delays” to vaccinations but also struck a defensive note, saying he would let “no one play with the safety” of the campaign. Axel Kahn, a leading geneticist and head of the National League Against Cancer, told Europe 1 radio that France’s vaccine strategy was wrong. “It is not suited to a situation that is so dangerous,” he said. Philippe Juvin, head of the casualty ward at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. “As an individual, I would like to be vaccinated to set an example and show people that we don’t die from the vaccine, we die from Covid. And when we don’t die, we can get severe forms of it that are very disabling,” Juvin told CNews television. Opposition leaders said the slowness of the vaccination programme made France the “dunce” of Europe. Damien Abad, leader of the centre-right opposition Les Républicains in the Assemblée Nationale, demanded an urgent meeting with the health minister. In a letter, other opposition critics wrote: “Mass vaccination is the ultimate means of seeing our country emerge from the damaging economic situation caused by the health crisis. Yet France is vaccinating 10,000 times slower than the UK.” They added: “France cannot be one of the last countries to get vaccinated and yet that’s the picture we’re facing today.” Alain Fischer, the government official overseeing France’s vaccination programme, told Europe 1 the country had chosen to prioritise the elderly and vulnerable, as opposed to health professionals, as in other countries. “There is no good or bad choice … These are small details that will seem ridiculous in two or three months,” he said. Critics say this hesitation is feeding conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxer sentiment. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, said the scientific data was clear. “The vaccine is safe and efficient. Like many of my colleagues, I think we should be giving the vaccines quicker in order to control the epidemic more rapidly. At the rate we’re going, we’ll still be in lockdown in 2022,” he tweeted.","Here's the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

President Macron spoke on Thursday. It was his speech for the new year. He said vaccinations must not take too long. But he also said that safety is most important. He said he will not let anyone risk safety during vaccinations.

Axel Kahn is a doctor. He studies genes. He is also the head of a group against cancer. He said France's plan for vaccines is not good. He said it is not right for a dangerous situation.

Philippe Juvin works at a hospital in Paris. He is in charge of the emergency room. He said he wants to get the vaccine. He wants to show people it is safe. He wants people to know that people die from COVID. COVID can also make people very sick for a long time.

Other leaders in France are not happy. They said France is vaccinating people too slowly. They said France is the worst in Europe for vaccinations.

Damien Abad is a leader in the government. He wants to talk to the health minister soon.

Other leaders wrote a letter. They said vaccines are very important. They said vaccines will help France's economy. The economy is bad because of the virus. They said France is vaccinating much slower than the UK. They said France cannot be one of the last countries to give vaccines. But that is happening now.

Alain Fischer is in charge of the vaccine program in France. He said France is giving vaccines to old and sick people first. Other countries are giving vaccines to doctors and nurses first. He said both ways are okay. He said people will not remember the small differences in a few months.

Some people think the slow start is bad. They think it makes people not trust the vaccine. They think it makes people believe wrong ideas about the vaccine.

Nathan Peiffer-Smadja is a doctor who studies infections. He said the vaccine is safe and works well. He thinks France should give vaccines faster. This will help stop the virus faster. He said if France continues slowly, they will still be in lockdown in 2022."

17,17_0,0,"Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

People in Gibraltar are checking the monkeys every day. These monkeys are called Barbary macaques. They are worried that the monkeys could get the coronavirus.

Gibraltar is a British place near Spain. Not many people there have had the virus. About 1,500 people got sick, and six people died.

Governments all over the world are trying to stop the virus. In Gibraltar, people have another problem. They want to protect the monkeys from the virus. These monkeys are the only wild monkeys in Europe.

Mark Pizarro takes care of the monkeys. He said that it was always a worry. The virus can live in people like us. So, it can be dangerous for monkeys too.

Earlier this year, the government made new rules. They wanted to stop people from getting close to the monkeys. Many tourists like to see the monkeys.

In August, they made a new law. Now, it is against the law to touch the monkeys. It is also against the law to give them food. People can get big fines if they do.

The government said that monkeys can get sick from people's diseases. They said that the monkeys got hepatitis A before.

The monkeys have lived in Gibraltar for a long time. Some people say that as long as the monkeys are there, Gibraltar will be British.

People have done a lot to protect the monkeys. During the war, Winston Churchill told people to bring more monkeys from Africa. Now, there are about 220 monkeys.

Recently, they tested four monkeys for the virus. But the monkeys died because of other things, like car accidents. The tests were negative. The government thinks the virus is not a big danger to the monkeys.

But in November, people got worried again. Denmark said they would kill many mink animals. They were worried that the virus was changing in the mink. They thought the changes could make the vaccine not work well."
17,17_1,1,"The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal. They interact with themselves, they forage naturally, they spend more time grooming each other, there’s less aggression between the macaques,” said Pizarro. “So there is a lot of positive spin from decreased human contact.”","Here's the rewritten text at A2 level:

The government in Gibraltar is worried. Denmark said something about the monkeys. It is ""very worrying"" for the government.

Denmark said that the monkeys might get sick. They could get a virus. If the monkeys get the virus, they could give it to people. The virus could change in the monkeys. This could make the vaccine not work well.

Pizarro has a team. His team has six people. They watch the monkeys every day. They have not seen many sick monkeys yet.

The team sees that the monkeys are doing better. There are fewer tourists now because of the virus. This is good for the monkeys.

Pizarro said the monkeys are acting normal again. They play with each other. They look for food by themselves. They clean each other more. They fight less.

Pizarro said less people is good for the monkeys."
18,18_0,0,"Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy analyst who served three decades in prison for leaking thousands of classified documents to Israel, has arrived in Tel Aviv after being released from parole. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”. The couple are expected to enter several days of quarantine, which is compulsory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of coronavirus.","Jonathan Pollard is in Israel now. He used to work for the US Navy. He gave secret papers to Israel. He was in prison for 30 years.

He was let out of prison. Then, he had to follow rules for some time. This time is called parole. Now, his parole is over. He went to Tel Aviv in Israel.

Benjamin Netanyahu is the leader of Israel. He met Jonathan and his wife, Esther. They came off a plane. The leader's office showed a video of this.

Jonathan and Esther are Jewish. They took off their masks. They kissed the ground. Then, they said hello to Netanyahu.

Jonathan said they were happy to be home. It took 35 years. He said he was proud of Israel and the leader. Jonathan was born in the US. But he became a citizen of Israel when he was in prison.

Netanyahu said a prayer. It was a prayer to thank God for letting prisoners go free. Then, Netanyahu gave Jonathan his Israeli papers. Netanyahu said, ""Welcome home."" Jonathan is 66 years old.

FBI agents caught Jonathan in 1985. He wanted to hide in the Israeli embassy. But he could not. In 1987, he was sent to prison for life.

The US and Israel are friends. But this made things difficult. Jonathan being in prison made things bad between the two countries. Netanyahu wanted Jonathan to be free for many years.

In the 1990s, Jonathan became a citizen of Israel. Netanyahu tried many times to ask the US president to let Jonathan go. But the president did not say yes.

Before leaving, the old US government let Jonathan out of parole. Netanyahu called Jonathan last month. He asked when he was coming to Israel. He said they were waiting for him.

Jonathan's lawyer said this was a dream come true. It was after 35 hard years.

Jonathan and Esther will stay inside for some days. This is because of the virus. Everyone coming to Israel must do this. This is to stop the virus from spreading."
19,19_0,0,"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that it would be glad to meet the letter’s signatories to discuss reforms. “We know that as a sector we can and must do better,” said chief executive Kate Henderson.","People are asking for changes in social housing. Social housing should help people more than make money.

This comes after a report in the Observer newspaper. The report was about a Black woman. She became homeless because her neighbours were racist.

Some important people who used to work in social housing have written a letter. These people are Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin, and Barry Simons. They sent the letter to the National Housing Federation.

The letter says that social housing is not doing enough to protect people from racism. The letter asks for a quick look at social housing rules. People who are racist should be moved out. Or, the people who are being hurt by racism should be moved to a new home first.

The group wrote the letter after reading about Laura Tate. This is not her real name. She has been homeless for five years. She left her flat because people were threatening to kill her.

Her housing company is called London and Quadrant (L&Q). L&Q did not move out the people who were hurting her. These people were found guilty of racism. L&Q also did not give Laura Tate a new home.

Last week, a judge gave her £31,000. This was because she sued L&Q for not helping her.

The Observer also wrote about another Black woman. She lived in a safe house for two years. She left her home because her ex-boyfriend was hurting her. L&Q did not give her a new home because she did not have enough proof that she was in danger.

Lord Filkin said that these problems happen often. He said that the people in charge of housing must make sure that people can live in peace. He said that they need to do more to make this happen.

L&Q is a big housing company. It has 105,000 homes for 250,000 people in the south-east of England. L&Q said that it will look at how it deals with abuse cases. This will be done by someone who is not working for L&Q.

L&Q said that it can learn from these problems. It also said that it does not allow any kind of racism.

The National Housing Federation helps housing companies. It said that it will meet with the people who wrote the letter. They will talk about how to make things better. Kate Henderson is in charge of the Federation. She said that they need to do more to help people."

Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him.

They did this before for Steve Biko. He was a student who fought against apartheid in South Africa. The government killed him. Bradford University had a bar named after him. It closed. Manchester University has a building named after him. It is the biggest student building in the UK.

21,21_0,0,"Confused anti-vaccine protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre, where they were filmed shouting abuse at staff and appearing to steal equipment. Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs.","Some people were protesting against vaccines. They were confused. They went to a test centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday.

They shouted at the people who worked there. They seemed to take some things from the centre. Someone filmed it and put it on social media.

A group of people walked through the test centre. They had signs. The signs said people should not get vaccines. The signs also criticized the BBC.

A man named Jeff Wyatt was with the group. He used to work for a political party. He spoke to the crowd before they went to the test centre. He said many people were against vaccines.

Piers Corbyn was also there. He is against lockdowns. He is the brother of Jeremy Corbyn. He was at other protests that day. The protests were called ""Freedom Rally"".

At the test centre, a man used a loudspeaker. He said vaccines were given there. But the sign said ""Testing"". Some protesters shouted bad words at the workers. The workers ran away to find a safe place.

A woman took a sign that said ""Reclaim NHS, End Jab"". She took a big box. It looked like it had test equipment and papers. She was not wearing a mask. She smiled at the cameras when she left.

He urged anyone with information to pass this on to Thames Valley police. Former health secretary Matt Hancock criticised the activists’ “appalling behaviour”.

Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said the group’s actions were “totally unacceptable”. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scenes were “disgraceful”. “For months now we have been warning need legislation to tackle those who harass others seeking healthcare. Government promised to act weeks ago but nothing as yet. Enough. It’s not free speech when 50% of debate in fear,” she said. Matthew Barber, police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, said it was “appalling” to see the protest “escalate into something much uglier”. He added that he had spoken to Thames Valley police officers to discuss the police response on Wednesday evening, and said that “criminal offences will be investigated and appropriate action taken”. “All of the events of today will be reviewed to help plan for future protest events and ensure that colleagues in the NHS can continue their fantastic work in delivering the vaccine rollout,” he said. Joe Harrison, CEO of Milton Keynes University hospital, said: “I am very sorry and angry to see NHS colleagues at Milton Keynes Covid testing centre harassed and intimidated at their place of work. “Our staff having to deal with increasing aggression and violence for simply doing their job. It’s abhorrent, unacceptable and we will not stand for it.”","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

22,22_0,0,"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","Mudassar Kadir used to work for the BBC in Afghanistan. The BBC is a news company.
The Taliban took control of Afghanistan.
Mr. Kadir was scared and left Afghanistan.
He is now in a refugee camp. This is a place for people who had to leave their country.
He has been in the camp for many months.
The UK government said they would help him. But they have not yet helped him.
Mr. Kadir is one of 14 people who used to work for the BBC.
He is the only one who could leave Afghanistan.
The other 13 people are still hiding. They are afraid for their lives.
Mr. Kadir also worked for the World Bank and the old government of Afghanistan.
He wanted to start a new life with his family.
He left Afghanistan in October with help from a charity in the USA.
He is now in a refugee camp near Dubai. He is with his wife and two young sons.
The United Arab Emirates is keeping them safe. They are taking good care of them.
But they cannot go more than a little distance from the building.
The United Arab Emirates will not give them a home.
Mr. Kadir is sad because the UK government will not help him.
He is still afraid he will be sent back to Afghanistan.
The Taliban are angry at him because he worked for the BBC.
He said the UK should help him and his family. He said his life is in danger because he worked for the BBC. The UK knows this, but they are not helping.
He hoped the UK would give him a visa. Now he is more and more sad every day.
Some people are helping refugees. They say Mr. Kadir's situation is like many other Afghans.
These Afghans cannot go back home because they are afraid.
And they cannot go to other countries that would take them in.
The UK government said they would help Afghan people come to the UK. They called this plan the Afghan Citizens' Resettlement Scheme. It should start in January and help 5,000 people each year.
The UK also has another plan called Afghanistan Relocation and Assistance Policy. But it is harder to get help from this plan.
Mr. Kadir cannot get help from this plan. It has helped fewer than 400 people.
He cannot apply for the new plan because it is not open yet.
When it opens, only charities can ask for help for people.
Some people think the UK government is waiting to start the plan. They think the UK wants to help fewer people."
22,22_1,1,"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office does not agree with this. A person from the Home Office said: ""The ACRS is a very good plan. It will help 20,000 people who are in danger to live in the UK.""

The person added: ""We are working hard to start the plan. It is difficult because things are changing. We are working with other groups to make the plan.""

The Home Office will not talk about single people. When asked why it is taking so long, the Home Office said they are making a system. This system will use ""biometric enrolment"" (fingerprints and photos). It will also check if people can join the plan. This is to make sure that people who come to the UK are not dangerous.

The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants is helping Kadir and other people like him. They say there is not much time left. Minnie Rahman is the head of this group. She said: ""Three months ago, the government said they would welcome Afghan refugees. But now, it seems like they are not welcome.""

She added: ""Like Kadir, many Afghan people have been left alone by the British government. They have connections to the UK. The resettlement plan is not open yet. It is hard for families to come together. The government is not helping people who worked with them and are in danger.""

The National Union of Journalists wants the government to help Afghan people who used to work for the BBC. One of them was attacked at home in October. Michelle Stanistreet is the head of this group. She said: ""The resettlement is very slow. The journalists are scared and hiding. We need to quickly bring the Afghan people who are in danger to the UK.""

A person from the BBC said: ""We feel bad for the people who used to work for us. But we cannot help them directly.""

Kadir said: ""I hope the UK government will keep their promise to me and my family. But right now, nobody is helping me. I came to the UAE two months ago, and nothing has changed.""

23,23_0,0,"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","The new year is coming. The world has many big problems.

*   The Covid-19 sickness is back.
*   The weather is changing in a bad way (climate change).
*   Some countries are free, and some are not (democracy vs. authoritarianism).
*   People need help in many places (humanitarian crises).
*   Many people are moving to new countries (mass migration).
*   Some groups are doing bad things in many countries (trans-national terrorism).

Countries might fight each other. It is harder for countries to work together. There are new weapons that can decide on their own who to attack (lethal autonomous weapons).

For most people, 2022 will be another hard year.

Something good and bad will happen in the Middle East.

The World Cup is in Qatar in November. Qatar is an Arab and Muslim country. It is the first time a country like this has the World Cup. This can bring more business and tourists to the Gulf area. It might also help the countries become more open.

But some people are not happy with Qatar having the World Cup. Some people think there was cheating. Qatar's rules about people are also not good. They treat workers from other countries badly.

The Guardian newspaper said that 6,500 workers have died in Qatar. They died while building stadiums, roads, hotels, and an airport for the World Cup.

Some people are worried that Qatar does not let people speak freely. They also worry about how Qatar treats women and LGBTQ+ people. It is not safe to speak against the government. Being gay is against the law.

But some people think that most fans will not care about these problems. They think the World Cup will make Qatar look good, even if it is not (sports-washing).

Other things will also be important in the Middle East. People will watch if Israel and the US will do something about Iran. Iran wants to make nuclear weapons, but they say they do not. Israel might attack Iran if talks do not work.

Even football fans will notice if there is a war in the Gulf."
23,23_1,1,"Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence.","Turkey is important in 2022. The President of Turkey is Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He has a lot of power. His party, AKP, has been in power for 20 years.

Erdoğan is becoming more strict in Turkey. His foreign policy is strong. He has problems with the EU and the US. He works with Russia sometimes about Syria. The economy in Turkey is not doing well. This could cause problems.

Lebanon is another important place. It is close to becoming a failed state. This is like Yemen, where there is a war. Libya is also chaotic.

Palestine is also important. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, is not popular. He stopped the elections. Israeli people are taking land in the West Bank. There is no peace process. These are big problems.

Asia is also important. People will watch China. This will happen at the start and end of the year. Maybe even in the middle of the year too.

The Winter Olympics are in Beijing in February. People want to see who wins the most medals. But some countries will not send officials. This is because they do not like China's human rights problems. These countries include the US and the UK. They think China will use the Olympics for propaganda.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will have a big meeting at the end of the year. This is the 20th national congress. President Xi Jinping wants to stay in power for five more years. This would be his third time. If this happens, he will be the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

People will also try to get important jobs in the CCP. But Xi Jinping may not get everything he wants.

Some people think Xi Jinping is very strong. Other people think he is not so strong. China's economy is slowing down. China has a lot of debt. The population is getting older. There are problems with the environment and climate change. The US is trying to stop China by working with other countries. This puts pressure on Xi Jinping.

But in 2022, China will likely try to grow its power around the world. This includes its economy and its influence in other countries."
23,23_2,2,"A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister.","A war with Taiwan could change everything. China wants to take Taiwan back. China might use force to do this.

India is China’s big competitor. India is growing. Soon, India might have as many people as China. China and India both have about 1.4 billion people. But Indian families are getting smaller.

China and India have problems with their border in the mountains. They fought in 2020 and 2021. This shows that they do not have good relations.

Narendra Modi is the leader of India. He is not as popular as before. The pandemic and the economy are problems. People did not like his new rules for farms. Some say he uses laws against terrorists to stop people from speaking against him. His political party will try to win votes in 2022.

Modi wants India to be friends with the West. He works with the US, Japan, and Australia. This makes China unhappy.

In Myanmar, the government is hurting people. In Afghanistan, the Taliban took over. People are suffering. The West is worried, but might not do much to help. Afghanistan is in a very bad situation.

The World Food Programme says that many people in Afghanistan are starving. The next six months will be very difficult.

North Korea has nuclear weapons. Its leader, Kim Jong-un, is acting dangerously. He sends confusing messages about war and peace. This could cause a big problem.

The Philippines will have a new leader. The current leader can't run again.

The leader of Australia, Scott Morrison, wants to be leader again."
23,23_3,3,"Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine.","Europe in the next year will be very important. The EU leaders must deal with problems inside and outside of Europe.

The pandemic is still here. It makes life hard for people and the economy. There are also problems with people moving to Europe.

After the COP26 meeting, countries want to stop using fossil fuels. This is also a challenge.

Europe needs to decide what it wants to be. Does it want to be a strong leader in the world? Or will it let China, the US, and Russia have more power?

The elections in France and Hungary will be important. They may show what will happen in Europe.

In Hungary, Viktor Orbán is the leader. He does not follow the rules of the EU about law, freedom, and democracy. He will have a difficult election against many people who don't agree with him. People in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and other countries are watching this election.

In France, Emmanuel Macron wants to be president again. Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour are also running. They have ideas that some people do not like. Macron is doing well in the polls. But Valérie Pécresse, a woman from another party, is also running. The left party is not strong. The election in France could change things a lot.

There will also be elections in Sweden, Serbia, and Austria.

Germany has a new government. People will watch to see how they do things differently after Angela Merkel. The new government may have problems with the EU Commission and with France about money.

France will lead the EU in January. Macron wants to make Europe stronger in defense. He thinks Europe should be able to protect itself.

Macron thinks Europe needs to be strong in the world. He will have to deal with many problems, like the situation in Ukraine."
23,23_4,4,"Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world.","**Russia and NATO**

Some people think Russia might start another war soon. Russia has many soldiers near its border with Ukraine. Russia said it might put nuclear weapons there. NATO countries might not help Ukraine.

Belarus is using people who want to move to Europe as a weapon. They are making it difficult for people to cross the border. Europe does not have a good plan to help these people. There is trouble in Bosnia and other places in the Balkans. Some people there want to separate from their countries.

**China and the EU**

The EU wants to meet with China. They need to decide if business or human rights are more important.

**Britain and the US**

Britain is not doing well after Brexit. Some people think that leaving the EU was a mistake. Britain's relationship with the US might be difficult. The US does not like Europe being independent. The US does not seem sure about what to do with Ukraine.

**NATO's Future**

NATO is having a hard time after what happened in Afghanistan. They need a new leader. Some people think a woman might get the job. Theresa May, who used to be the leader of Britain, could get the job. But France does not want someone from Britain to be the leader.

**Brazil**

Brazil will have elections in October. It will be a big fight. The current leader is Jair Bolsonaro. Many people do not like him.

Bolsonaro did not handle the COVID-19 pandemic well. Many people in Brazil died. Only the US had more deaths. Bolsonaro does not believe in climate change. He is letting people destroy the Amazon rainforest.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva used to be the president. He was in jail, but now he is free. People think he will win the election if he runs. But some people are worried that the election might not be fair.

People who support Donald Trump are helping Bolsonaro. They might try to steal the election. They might try to take over the government like Trump tried to do in the US. People worry that others will copy Trump's bad ideas about elections."
23,23_5,5,"Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision.","In Europe, some people think that right-wing politicians are becoming less popular. But this may not be true in South America, except for Brazil. It may also not be true in other poor countries in 2022.

Populism is strong when there is a big difference between rich and powerful leaders and normal people. In many poor countries, this difference is getting bigger.

In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who said they would help the people have become bad rulers. This situation might continue.

In Chile, there was a presidential election. José Antonio Kast, a very right-wing politician, got a lot of votes in the first part of the election. He liked Pinochet, a former leader. But he lost to Gabriel Boric. Boric is a young, left-wing leader. He won the election and will be the youngest leader of Chile.

Argentina's president, Alberto Fernández, has problems. His political party, the Peronists, lost their majority in the Congress. This is the first time in 40 years. It looks like a hard year for him.

Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will have problems with the United States. These problems are about trade, drugs, and people moving from Central America. But he does not have to deal with Trump's bad words anymore, for now.

In North America, everyone is watching the elections in November. The Democrats want to keep control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Republicans want to win them back.

The results of the elections will show what people think about Joe Biden, the president. If the Republicans do well, Donald Trump might run for president again in 2024. He still says he won the election in 2020, but that is not true.

Some important issues are:

*   The COVID-19 virus and if it is getting better. Some people do not want to get the vaccine.
*   The economy. Prices and interest rates might go up.
*   Social issues like people moving to the country, race, and abortion. The Supreme Court might change the Roe v Wade decision about abortion. This is a very important decision from 1973."
23,23_6,6,"The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September.","The Democrats have a big problem. They have groups inside the party that do not agree. Some are called progressives, and some are called moderates. They argue a lot, especially in the Senate.

This fighting made it hard for President Biden to pass laws. He wanted to spend money on social care and roads. But the laws were changed because of the fighting.

People are watching President Biden. He will be 80 years old soon. They wonder if he will run for president again in 2024. They also wonder if he is able to do his job well. Many people do not like the job he is doing now. It may be hard for him to get more people to like him.

Kamala Harris is the Vice-President. People are also watching her. Some people say she is not doing a good job. They say she is not happy in her job. Maybe these people want to make problems for the President.

Pete Buttigieg is important too. He is in charge of transportation. He wanted to be president in 2020. People think he could replace Kamala Harris. He could even replace President Biden if Biden only stays for one term.

People are worried about the elections. The elections are called ""mid-terms."" Some Republicans are trying to make it harder for people to vote. They are also drawing maps that help Republicans win.

One study says Republicans will win at least five more seats in the House. This is because of the new maps. This could give the Republicans control of the House before the voting even starts.

Many people from Central America want to come to the United States. They are at the border with Mexico. This will be a big problem in 2022. Kamala Harris is in charge of this problem. But some people say she is not doing a good job. People say she and Biden are doing the same bad things that Trump did.

People do not trust President Biden as much now. This is because of what happened in Afghanistan. Many people thought it was a very bad and embarrassing situation.

If something bad happens in another country, it could hurt President Biden. For example, if Russia takes land in Ukraine, that would be bad. If China attacks Taiwan, that would be bad. If Israel and Iran fight, that would be bad. These things could make the US get involved and make things bad for Biden.

In Canada, Justin Trudeau is the Prime Minister. He wants to make new laws about childcare and houses. He wants to make them more affordable. He won the election in September."
23,23_7,7,"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","In 2021, there was an election. Justin Trudeau's party won. But they got the least votes of any winning party before. Some people think Trudeau is not as popular now.

There are problems with Trudeau. Some people say there is corruption. People disagree about how he handled the pandemic. There are also problems with trade with the US. And people disagree about rules about carbon.

Africa is a big place. Big things will happen there in 2022.

One big question is about vaccines. Many people in Africa are not vaccinated. Rich countries have most of the vaccines. They don't want to give extra vaccines to Africa. They don't want to share the way to make vaccines. Will this hurt Africa?

This raises another question. Will this hurt rich countries too? Gordon Brown said it might.

Omicron started in South Africa. More new kinds of Covid might come in 2022. Rich countries might try to protect themselves first. They might not help other countries.

We don't know what will happen with the pandemic in 2022. It could hurt people's health and money.

Many people in Africa are young. They might not get very sick from Covid. But Covid might make other health problems worse.

About 25 million people in Africa have HIV-Aids. Malaria kills many people each year. Covid can make it harder to treat these diseases. It can also make it harder to treat TB and diabetes.

Some people think Africa is now the main place for terrorism. This may continue in 2022.

The Sahel area has many radical groups. These groups are often from Africa. But they also work with groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State.

Western countries might try to fight these groups more in 2022."
23,23_8,8,"This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought.","The leaders of the US and France, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, made an agreement to work together. France stopped helping Mali because they did not have enough support.

Many countries are worried. Radical ideas from Nigeria and other countries in West Africa are spreading. These ideas are going to places like Congo and Mozambique.

Somalia is a country with problems. The al-Shabaab group is there. It shows what can happen when terrorism is not stopped. This is a warning for other countries.

The US will have another meeting about democracy this year. The meeting will talk about democracy around the world. In Africa, this is very important because there were many coups in 2021. A recent coup happened in Sudan.

Poverty is also a big problem. It is connected to the lack of democracy. The International Rescue Committee says that many countries in Africa are in danger. They think things will get worse for people there.

These countries include: Ethiopia, South Sudan, Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger, and Cameroon.

Other countries that are in danger are: Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, and Venezuela.

In Ethiopia, there are many problems. There is a civil war. The country might break apart. Eritrea is a nearby country that is making things worse.

The UN says that there will be a bad drought in Somalia. About 7.7 million people may be in danger by April.

UNICEF is asking for a lot of money. They want $9.4 billion to help people around the world. They want to help 327 million people, including 177 million children. These people are having problems because of crises and Covid.

These problems make another thing difficult in 2022: migration. People are leaving their homes. Some are refugees because of war. Some are asking for help because they are in danger. Some are leaving because of climate change, hunger, and drought."
23,23_9,9,"The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at an A2 level, following your instructions:

**People Moving Around the World**

The United Nations says many people moved to other countries in 2020. 281 million people moved. That is 3.6% of all people in the world. This is a very big number.

More and more people are moving. This is happening even though it is hard to travel now.

Many people moving is a big change. But many governments have not done much about it. This is true in rich countries like in North America and Europe. Maybe things will change in 2022. But we don't know.

**Climate Change**

There was a meeting about climate change in Glasgow. Another meeting will be in Egypt in November. It is called Cop27.

At the meeting, countries will talk about what they promised in Glasgow. They promised to make less carbon. Carbon is bad for the Earth. They also promised to stop cutting down trees. They promised to use less coal. Coal is a fuel that makes carbon. They also promised to help poor countries. Poor countries are hurt by climate change.

It will take a long time to fix the climate. The weather will still be bad in 2022. We will see fires, and not enough rain. We will see big floods and strong storms. It will be very hot. This happened in 2021.

The weather will be very bad in some places. This is true in the Arctic and Antarctica.

**Arctic and Antarctic**

More people will go to the Arctic and Antarctica in 2022. This may not be good.

Many tourists will go to Antarctica. Big planes can now land there.

China and other countries want to use things from Antarctica. They also want to build army places there. This is a problem.

The ice in the Arctic is melting. Now ships can go there. Russia is using these new paths. Other countries want to use them too.

Greenland has many minerals. Companies want to take them. Some people in Greenland do not want this.

**Space**

Many things will happen in space in 2022. Countries will explore space. They will also compete with each other.

NASA will send many missions to space. They want to go back to the moon with people. They want to build a new space station. It is called Gateway.

Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will send ships to the moon. Europe wants to send a ship to Mars."
23,23_10,10,"China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind.","China wants to have a space station soon. The space station will work well by the end of this year.

Also, space travel for fun is starting. Russia and some companies are doing this. Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic, is one. Jeff Bezos's company, Blue Origin, is another.

But there is also a worry. Some countries are making new weapons for space. This could be a race for nuclear weapons in space. The US, Russia, and China are trying new things. They are making weapons that can fly fast in space. These weapons can launch nuclear missiles from anywhere in space.

Russia made people angry in 2021. They tested a missile that can destroy satellites. Other countries might do the same. This could be bad for our communication systems around the world.

Nasa wants to change the path of a big asteroid. They will crash a spacecraft into it in September. The spacecraft will be launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's company, SpaceX. The US calls this ""planetary defense."" But this technology can also be used to attack.

Some people think this is progress. Other people think it is a bad thing for everyone."
24,24_0,0,"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails.","Many UK scientists and doctors helped the government during the pandemic. A newspaper called the Guardian asked these experts about their experiences. The survey showed that many of them were treated very badly.

Some people were very angry with the experts. They sent them mean messages online. Some experts even got death threats. This means people said they would kill them.

Some people took photos of the experts' houses and shared them online. Some experts got strange packages in the mail. The packages had bad messages written on them.

The experts also got angry tweets, emails, and phone calls. Some people sent them hate mail. They threatened the experts with violence.

Some people complained to the experts' bosses. Some people even reported them to a medical group. Some experts found bad notes on their cars. Some people shouted bad things through their doors.

The police found some of the people who made these threats. They charged them with crimes.

The abuse did not only happen to the experts. Their students, work friends, and families were also hurt. This included their partners and children.

One expert worked as a doctor. People shouted bad things at the receptionists at the doctor's office. This was because the doctor was helping the government.

In another case, a teacher was mean to an expert's child. The teacher blamed the parent for the rules about staying home. The family did not complain because the teacher would grade the child's tests.

The Guardian sent the survey to more than 100 experts. These experts help the government in different groups. Some of these groups are called Sage, Nervtag, and JCVI.

The answers from the survey were kept private. 42 experts answered the survey. Many of them said they got a lot of abuse. This was about the government's rules, their science ideas, or their research. This often happened after they were in the news or spoke at public events.

One expert, Professor John Edmunds, said he often got mean emails. His younger workers also got mean emails. He is a scientist at a school in London and helps with the Sage group."
24,24_1,1,"“If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers.","He said that talking about vaccines in the news can cause problems. This is especially true for children's vaccines.

But this only happens if the news is on certain websites. One website is called the Daily Mail.

One advisor got a death threat on Twitter. They told the police. When this advisor was on TV, they got many bad messages.

One doctor said that many messages were bad to women. They said that they were trying to help people not die. They had never seen anything like this before.

Some people are more afraid of the government than the sickness. But the advisors do not make the rules.

The advisors get bad messages when they talk about masks, vaccines, and other things. This is happening more now because of a new sickness called Omicron.

Last year, the advisors got many threats. The government told them how to stay safe. They learned how to make their computers safe. They also learned how to be safe when they went to work. For example, they changed the time and the way they went to work. They also checked under their cars.

Some advisors had security people look at their homes and work. They put in alarms and cameras. The cameras are always on and connected to the police.

Some universities hired security guards. The guards help the experts stay safe. They also stop people from bothering them at work.

The government tried to take down some bad things online. But they could not take everything down.

Many advisors got bad emails and messages on Twitter. Some messages said, ""I hope your family die."" Other messages were very mean. Some people said the vaccines were killing children.

Sometimes the news made things worse. They showed the worst things that could happen. They also attacked the advisors. This made the bad messages from people on the internet seem okay."
24,24_2,2,"The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

The survey looked at abuse online. It did not find proof that women got more abuse than men. But some women did not want to talk about their experiences.

Many men were sad about the abuse women they knew received. One man said women get much more abuse than men. This is not fair.

The advisers got a lot of abuse. But they also got praise and thanks from people. This made them feel better. One adviser said the praise helped him deal with the hate.

George Freeman is a science minister. He said the abuse was very bad. He said we must all speak out against it. Scientists should not be blamed for decisions made by ministers. Ministers are responsible to the parliament.

Chi Onwurah is also a science minister. She said the abuse was not okay. She said we need a new law to stop false information online. This law is taking too long to come.

Many advisers thanked the government for help. But some said they needed warnings and advice before they started.

Because of the abuse, some scientists do not want to talk anymore. They do not want to give interviews. They are thinking of stopping giving advice.

But most scientists said the abuse did not affect them much. Some even felt stronger. One adviser said it made him want to speak more. He said his voice was heard.

Another adviser said it is important to speak up. If they stop giving advice, wrong information will spread. We cannot let this happen. We must not let wrong information risk people's lives."
25,25_0,0,"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban].","Ashraf Ghani used to be the president of Afghanistan. He has now spoken for the first time since he left Kabul. He left Kabul four months ago.

He said that other countries and the United States are to blame. He thinks they caused the fall of Afghanistan.

Ghani spoke to the BBC. He said his security man told him to leave Kabul quickly. His security man was very scared. His name was Hamdullah Mohib. The security team for the president was also failing.

Ghani said Mohib told him that the security team was gone. Mohib said that if Ghani stayed, they would all die. Mohib only gave Ghani two minutes to leave.

Ghani spoke to a man named Nick Carter. Carter used to be in charge of the British army. He was working for the BBC.

The Taliban group was taking control of Afghanistan. This happened before Ghani left. But when Ghani left quickly, it made things worse. People hoped for a peaceful change of power. This could have helped keep money coming into the country. It could have helped to form a government for everyone.

Now, Afghanistan is in danger of a big hunger problem. The economy is much worse. The health and schools are in bad shape. This is because other countries stopped giving money. Afghanistan needed that money.

Carter asked Ghani what he would say to the Afghan people. Many people in Afghanistan blame Ghani for the problems. Ghani said his biggest mistake was trusting other countries. He said he trusted the partnerships with other countries. He said everyone made a mistake to think that the other countries would help for a long time.

Ghani said that the United States did not include his government in talks with the Taliban. These talks lasted for years. He said that deals made by the US hurt the Afghan people. The deals helped US soldiers leave easily.

Ghani said that the US team is responsible. He said that his government was never able to talk to the Taliban."
25,25_1,1,"Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue. They erased us.” Khalilzad said in his own interview with the Today programme that the collapse of the republic was due to a “failure of Afghan leadership” and Afghan troops that did not “resist hard” against the Taliban. Six months ago the two men were among the most influential figures shaping Afghanistan’s future; now neither are willing to accept any responsibility for the tragedy stalking the country. Carter asked the former president about any personal regrets that had surfaced in the last 100 days. Ghani did not mention the humanitarian crisis, but he lamented the damage to his reputation and legacy. “My work has been destroyed. My values have been trampled on, and I’ve been made a scapegoat.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

Ambassador Khalilzad talked to them. It was now an American problem. It was not an Afghan problem anymore. They forgot about us.

Khalilzad said that Afghanistan fell because the leaders were not good. He also said that Afghan soldiers did not fight the Taliban hard enough. He said this in an interview.

Six months ago, two men were very important. They helped decide the future of Afghanistan. Now, they do not want to say they did anything wrong. They do not want to say they are responsible for the sad situation in the country.

Carter asked the old president if he was sorry about anything in the last few months. Ghani did not talk about the people who need help. But he was sad that his name and work were hurt. He said, ""My work is ruined. My good ideas are gone. People blame me for everything."""

Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country.","Many people in South Africa will remember Desmond Tutu. He was a famous man who fought against apartheid. Apartheid was a system where black people did not have the same rights as white people.

Desmond Tutu died on Sunday. He was 90 years old. Churches will ring bells for him every day this week. The bells will ring for 10 minutes at 12 o'clock.

People all over the world are remembering Desmond Tutu. They say he was a good person. He helped his country. Many things will happen to remember his life.

Barack Obama used to be the president of the United States. He said that Desmond Tutu cared about freedom and fairness. He cared about injustice everywhere.

Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize. This is a very important award. People will be able to see his body for two days. Then, there will be a funeral on January 1st. It will be at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town. This was his church.

The bells at the church will ring every day at 12 o'clock. They will ring until Friday. This is to honor him.

Many memorial services will happen in South Africa. Flags will fly lower than usual.

Archbishop Thabo Makgoba said the bells will ring at many churches. In Cape Town, people will say a special prayer.

South Africa still has problems. There is inequality and divided politics. Apartheid caused many problems. Desmond Tutu was a leader in the fight for freedom. His death has made people feel united.

People from all groups are visiting St George's Cathedral. They are remembering Desmond Tutu. They are putting flowers near his picture. They are writing in a book to show they are sad.

Miriam Mokwadi is a retired nurse. She is 67 years old. She said Desmond Tutu was a hero. He fought for them. She said they are free because of him. If it was not for him, they would be lost as a country."
26,26_1,1,"He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo. Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party.","Here's the rewritten text at an A2 level:

Mokwadi held her granddaughter's hand. She said, ""He was good.""

Brent Goliath cried outside the old church. He was sad. Brent said Tutu was important for everyone, not just people who go to his church. He was an altar boy. He met Tutu many times.

""I was very sad this morning,"" Brent said. ""I heard that he died. I am thankful he helped us."" He wiped his eyes. He put pink flowers under Tutu's picture.

Daphney Ramakgopa is 58. She works for the local government. She said the whole country is sad. ""We looked up to him,"" she said. ""He gave advice to everyone, especially the politicians.""

The South African cricket team played a game. They wore black bands on their arms. This was to honor Tutu. Table Mountain in Cape Town was lit up with purple light. This was also to honor him.

Cyril Ramaphosa is the president of South Africa. He said Tutu was very smart and honest. He was strong against apartheid. Apartheid was a time when people were treated unfairly because of their skin color.

Ramaphosa said Tutu's death is sad. It is another loss for South Africa. Many great South Africans have died. They helped make South Africa free. F.W. de Klerk died in November. He was the last president during apartheid.

Graça Machel is Nelson Mandela's wife. She said fighting for freedom in South Africa needed great courage. It was hard to describe.

Tutu was not in public much in recent years. But he still fought for what he believed in. He helped LGBT people. He wanted everyone to have education. He also supported people who wanted help to die.

Tutu was a nice person. He laughed a lot. He was friendly. But he also believed strongly in his ideas. He was not afraid to speak against the government if he thought they were wrong. He was critical of the African National Congress party."
26,26_2,2,"Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer.","The rules about Covid in South Africa say how many people can go to a funeral. Only 100 people can go to the funeral. This is what the church people said. They said the church is too small for everyone who wants to come.

The funeral will be a special church service. It is called an Anglican requiem mass. Desmond Tutu wanted this kind of service. Michael Nuttall will lead the service. He used to be a bishop. People called him ""number 2 to Tutu.""

Nuttall and Tutu were good friends in the 1980s. They showed how a white leader and a black leader could work together. This is what the church people told reporters.

Tutu was born in a small town. The town is called Klerksdorp. It is near Johannesburg. He was born on October 7, 1931.

He used to be a teacher. But he quit his job because he did not like the unfair laws in South Africa. This was in 1958. The laws were called apartheid. Apartheid started ten years earlier.

Tutu studied religion in the UK. White police officers there called him ""Sir."" He was surprised by this.

Tutu became more and more important in the church. In the late 1970s, he was a leader for freedom. People in other countries knew him. He helped make leaders in the West think about apartheid. They had been helping the white people in South Africa.

In 1984, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize. He did not use violence. After that, he became the archbishop of Cape Town.

In 1994, South Africa had its first free elections. Nelson Mandela became president. Tutu called South Africa the ""Rainbow Nation."" He also led a group called the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This group told about the bad things that happened during apartheid.

Tutu also told the new leaders when they did something wrong. He told Mandela that ministers were paid too much. He also said that President Jacob Zuma was not a good leader. Zuma's time as president ended in 2018. People said he was stealing money.

Tutu had cancer in his body since 1997. He got treatment for it many times. He did not go out in public very often."
26,26_3,3,"In one of his last this year, he emerged from hospital in a wheelchair to get a Covid-19 vaccine, waving but not offering comment. The archbishop had been in a weakened state for several months and died peacefully at 7am (0500 GMT) on Sunday, according to several of his relatives. The Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu “an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.”","He was sick this year. He left the hospital in a wheelchair. He got a Covid-19 vaccine. He waved to people. He did not say anything.

The archbishop was not strong for many months. He died quietly on Sunday at 7am. This information came from his family.

The Nelson Mandela Foundation spoke about Tutu. They said he was a very special person. They said he was smart. He was a leader. He was like a shepherd for his people."
27,27_0,0,"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","This was a very bad year for human rights in Russia. It started with Alexei Navalny going to prison.

Then, the group called International Memorial was closed. This was very cruel.

Andrei Sakharov and others started the group in the 1980s. At that time, Russia was changing. Mikhail Gorbachev gave people more freedom.

Memorial used this freedom to show the truth. They told about the people who suffered under Stalin. Millions of people were hurt or killed.

Memorial was a symbol of a new, open Russia. People learned about their families. They found out what happened to their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. For many years, this information was secret.

Now, Memorial is closed. This is also a symbol. It shows that Russian society is being destroyed very fast.

The leaders of Memorial hoped people would help them. They thought that people like Gorbachev would support them. They also thought that Putin would not close a group that tells about bad things from the past.

But on Tuesday, a judge closed Memorial. This was 30 years after the Soviet Union ended.

Nikita Petrov helped start Memorial. He said he never thought things would get so bad. He thought Russia would become a better, more free country.

Putin sees things differently. He is worried about history. He thinks talking about the Soviet past is bad for Russia.

He cares more about the past wrongs done to Russia. He does not care about the truth that Memorial found in the archives. Memorial worked for 30 years to find this truth.

Memorial said that Russia needs to understand its past. This is important for the future."
27,27_1,1,"In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","Instead of Memorial, the government wants something different. Memorial talked strongly about terrible deaths of many people.

The government wants to show these deaths in a nicer, more careful way. They want to say the deaths were bad. But they do not want to say who killed them. They want to say who died, but not who the killers were.

The Russian government says they closed Memorial because of laws about ""foreign agents."" They say it is just paperwork.

But in court, a government lawyer said something else. He said Memorial was saying bad things about the USSR. He said Memorial was saying the USSR was like a terrorist.

The lawyer said, ""We are the children of the winners. Why should we see people who were against our country being praised?"" He was talking about people who helped the Nazis.

A lawyer for Memorial said this reminded him of old unfair trials from the 1930s.

The people in charge of Memorial do not know why the government closed them down. They do not know what they did wrong.

Some people think it is because Memorial studied the bad things the USSR did. Others think it is because Memorial helped political prisoners, like Navalny.

But Memorial has always done the same thing. Russia has changed. Maybe Russia no longer wants people to talk honestly about the past.

Kenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch said the government is afraid. They do not want people to see the truth that Memorial shows.

He said, ""If the truth is too bad to see, the government should change what they do. They should not stop people from showing the truth."""
28,28_0,0,"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","Some cities in Spain are doing something new. They want to help women who have pain during their periods.

These cities are in Europe. They are giving women time off work when they have their period. This is to make work easier for them.

Girona is a city in Spain. It was the first city to do this. They let women work in a different way if they have period pain.

Girona has more than 1,300 workers. Women can take up to eight hours off each month. But they must work those hours later. They have three months to do this.

Maria Àngels Planas is a leader in Girona. She said that Girona is doing something special. They are talking about periods openly.

She said periods can be painful for women. They want to stop hiding this problem.

Other cities like Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques are doing the same thing.

Castellón de la Plana is another city. They also let women take time off for periods. They have 1,500 workers. Some workers asked for this help.

In Asia, some countries have had period policies for a long time. They worry that work can make it hard for women to have babies.

In 2016, some women in Japan and China talked about this. They did not want to take time off. They thought men at work would be angry. They also thought it could hurt their chances to get a better job.

In 2016, a company in Bristol, called Coexist, also started giving period leave. They wanted to change the work culture.

They did not want women to have to work when they felt bad. They did not want them to use sick days for period pain.

This idea started a big discussion. Some people liked it. Others did not. But Coexist said that their workers were happier and worked better.

Studies show that many women have taken time off work or school because of their period. About 14% of women have done this.

A workers group in Girona asked for this new period leave. They wanted to help women feel better at work."
28,28_1,1,"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","Sílvia Rubio works for the Intersindical-CSC union. She said there were many problems.

At first, the union wanted women to have two days off each month. But they stopped this idea. They thought companies might not hire women. Or they might not give women important jobs.

Rubio said they changed the plan. Now, women will work more hours later. This will stop unfair treatment because they are women.

It was hard to talk to the city council. The union first wanted 16 hours off each month. But the city council said no. They agreed to only eight hours.

Some people in the union did not like the idea. This surprised Rubio. She said there were many arguments.

Some women said their husbands have headaches. They asked why men cannot have time off too. Other women worried the policy would make women look bad. They thought people would think periods are always painful.

Rubio said it is important to see the big picture. She said it is great they did this. This is a women's problem around the world. Many people feel ashamed about it. No one is doing anything about it. But they did it.

She said they do not want to stop here. She thinks this is the first step. They want a better place to work. They want to help people with problems like long-term sickness. They also want to help people who need to take care of others.

She said this will help men and women. It will help people who work for the government and people who work for companies. It will make workplaces better for everyone."
29,29_0,0,"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has many new cases of coronavirus. This is a record for France and Europe. The Omicron type of the virus is making cases go up in Europe.

France had 208,000 new cases in one day. The day before, they had almost 180,000 cases. That was also a record.

The health minister said that two people in France get the virus every second. He said they have never seen so many cases. He called the increase ""very fast.""

The hospitals in France are already worried because of the Delta type of the virus. The Omicron type is new, and it has not affected the hospitals much yet. But the minister said it will affect the hospitals soon.

The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Greece also have many new cases. In the US, there are 267,000 new cases each day. Omicron is 59% of these cases.

Australia has almost 18,300 new cases. The day before, they had 11,300 cases. The prime minister said they need to change their plan.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that Delta and Omicron are both spreading. This is causing many infections. This could mean more people in the hospital and more deaths.

The head of WHO is worried. He said Omicron is spreading fast, and Delta is still here. This is like a big wave of cases.

The WHO said Omicron is a ""very high"" risk. It could be too much for the hospitals.

Studies show that Omicron may not be as dangerous as other types. But many people are getting it. This means hospitals may have too many patients. Businesses may have problems because workers have to stay home.

Omicron spreads very fast. Governments are trying to find the right thing to do. They want to stop the virus to protect the hospitals. But they also want to keep the economy going."
29,29_1,1,"Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10, even as the number of new infections hit record highs, after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level, following your instructions:

**Spain Changes Rules for Covid**

Spain had a rule about staying home if you might have Covid. People had to stay home for ten days. Now, Spain says people only need to stay home for seven days.

This happened because many people are getting Covid. This is because of a new type of Covid called Omicron. Businesses were worried because many workers could not come to work.

**Italy Changes Rules for Covid, too**

Italy has also changed some rules about Covid. If you had three Covid shots, you do not need to stay home. This is true even if you were near someone with Covid.

Italy also made rules stricter for people who did not get the Covid shot. After January 10th, you need a health pass to travel. The health pass shows you got the shot or were sick with Covid before. You need it for the bus, train, and airplane inside Italy.

Italy said no to a plan to make rules stricter for workers who did not get the shot.

On Wednesday, Italy said 98,030 new people got Covid. This is the most new cases in one day.

**France Debates New Rules**

People in France are talking about a new law. The law says only people with Covid shots can go to some places. These places are bars, restaurants, and movie theaters. They also include museums and sports places. You cannot go to these places only with a negative Covid test. You must have the shot.

**Other Countries Change Rules**

Italy is one of many countries that stopped parties. They stopped parties because Covid is spreading again.

Greece also stopped parties for Christmas and New Year’s. Now, Greece has new rules for restaurants. Restaurants and bars must close at 12 at night. People cannot stand up in the bars. There is no music allowed. But on New Year's Eve, they can stay open until 2 in the morning.

The health minister in Greece said if people follow these rules, things can go back to normal in January.

**Germany Waits for More Covid Cases**

Some countries are waiting for more people to get sick with Omicron. In Germany, fewer people are getting sick right now. But the health minister said the real number is probably higher. This is because fewer people are getting tested because of the holidays.

The health minister thinks the real number of people with Covid is much higher than the official number. He thinks there will be many more people with Covid soon."
29,29_2,2,"On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors. It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events. Lauterbach said the rules may have to be toughened further, as existing measures “will not be enough to prevent a significant rise in Omicron cases”. In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated.","Here is the rewritten text in CEFR A2 level English:

On Tuesday, Germany said nightclubs must close. They also said sports events must happen without people watching.

People cannot have big parties. Only 10 people who have the vaccine can meet. If someone does not have the vaccine, only two families can meet.

These rules are new. There were already rules for people without the vaccine. They cannot go to shops, restaurants, or fun events.

Lauterbach said the rules might become stronger. He said the rules may not stop Omicron from spreading a lot.

In Belgium, things are different. The number of sick people is low there. The government changed its mind. They will let theatres and movie theaters open again. A court said they could not close them.

Other countries in Europe still have problems with the Delta type of the virus.

Poland said 794 people died from Covid on Wednesday. This is the most in the fourth wave of the virus.

Waldemar Kraska works for the health ministry. He said most of the people who died did not have the vaccine. More than 75% did not have the vaccine."
30,30_0,0,"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city.","Ukrainian soldiers are fighting in the east and south of Ukraine. They are trying to take back the city of Kreminna. Kreminna is in the Luhansk area. Russia controls this city now.

The leader of the Luhansk area, Serhiy Haidai, said something about this. He said that Russian soldiers had to move back. They moved to Rubizhne. Rubizhne is near Kreminna. The Ukrainian army made them move.

Haidai said that Russia knows something important. If they lose Kreminna, they will lose other places too. Russia has made strong defenses in Kreminna. They have been working for over a month. They are sending more soldiers and equipment.

It is hard to know exactly what is happening in the war.

If Ukraine takes back Kreminna and Svatove, it will be good for them. Then they can attack Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these cities in the summer.

The fighting is very bad. There are no peace talks now.

Sergei Lavrov is a leader in Russia. He said Ukraine must agree to what Russia wants. Russia wants Ukraine to have fewer weapons. Russia also says Ukraine needs to get rid of ""Nazis."" If Ukraine does not agree, Russia will win the war.

Lavrov's words show that Russia wants to change the government in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin said Russia wants to talk about ending the war. But Lavrov's words show something different.

Britain's army said something about the fighting. They said that Russian soldiers are trying to take Bakhmut. Bakhmut is in the Donetsk area. Russian soldiers and Wagner fighters are trying to take Bakhmut. They have been trying since July.

Bakhmut is very damaged. There has been fighting there for five months. People call it the ""Bakhmut meat-grinder."" This means the fighting there is very bad.

The fight for Bakhmut is important for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He is the leader of the Wagner group. He has hired many prisoners to fight in Bakhmut."
30,30_1,1,"Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory. Since the start of the war, a number of military targets, including oil and weapon depots have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks inside Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as payback.","Here's the rewritten text, adjusted to CEFR A2 level:

Prigozhin has talked about the Russian army before. He said they are not doing well in Ukraine. He said Wagner soldiers are the best fighters in Russia.

There is a new video. It may show problems in the Russian army. In the video, two men seem to be Wagner soldiers. They are saying bad things about a top army leader, Valery Gerasimov. The video was said to be made near Bakhmut.

One man in the video said, ""You are like the devil. We have nothing to fight with. We have no bullets.""

The Guardian newspaper is not sure if the video is real. But Russian reporters asked Prigozhin about the video. Prigozhin seemed to agree with the soldiers. He said he went to Bakhmut to meet them.

Prigozhin said, ""The men asked me to tell you that it is hard to understand the war if you are in a warm office."" He seemed to be talking about the top army leaders.

Last Thursday, Ukraine said Russia moved some planes. The planes were moved from the Engels airfield. Moscow said Ukraine attacked the airfield with a drone. Three Russian soldiers died.

A Ukrainian officer, Yuriy Ignat, said the planes are now in different places. He said some planes are still at the airfield. But many planes have been moved.

Also, Russian security said they killed four Ukrainian soldiers. The soldiers were on a secret mission in Russia. They were in the Bryansk area, near the border with Ukraine.

If this is true, it shows that Ukrainian soldiers are doing secret things inside Russia.

Since the war started, some places in Russia have been damaged. These places include oil and weapon storage. They caught fire.

Ukraine does not say they attacked Russia. But they are happy when these things happen. They think it is revenge."

31,31_0,0,"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce.","Many European countries are getting ready. They want to watch for new types of coronavirus from China.

China is changing its rules about the virus. Spain and France are making people take tests at airports again. This is for people coming from China.

On Friday, Spain and France did what Italy did. People from China must show a negative test. This means they do not have the virus. But Spain has an exception. People who are vaccinated do not need a test.

Carolina Darias is the health minister in Spain. She said she wants to change the rules for the EU's Covid certificate. This certificate shows if people are safe to travel.

In China, many people are getting sick. Some countries do not trust the numbers from China. So, these countries are checking people for Covid again. This includes the US, India, and others. The UK is also starting to check people.

China says these tests are not fair. They think other countries are trying to hurt China. They say it is because China is opening up again.

Officials in Europe are watching carefully. But they do not think it is time to worry too much. Germany's health minister said tests are not needed yet. People can travel from China to Germany without tests.

The minister said the virus information from China is not good. So, Germany needs to check on its own. They will look at flights carefully.

The EU's health leader wants countries to check the virus in people. They also want to check the water from airports. This will help them find new types of the virus from China.

Stella Kyriakides wrote a letter to the health ministers of the EU countries. She said they need to be careful. China will let people travel more on January 8. But the EU does not have good information about the virus in China."
31,31_1,1,"In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, argued that requiring Covid tests for all passengers from China was “only effective if it is taken at the European level”, noting that many people arrive in Italy on connecting flights through other European countries. After an announcement made by Italy’s health ministry on Thursday, travellers from China are obliged to show a negative test result upon embarking on their flight and to take a second antigen test upon their arrival.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level:

Kyriakides wrote a letter to ministers. Reuters said this. In the letter, Kyriakides told ministers to check how they study the coronavirus. They should do this quickly. They need to study the genes of the virus. This is an important first step.

Earlier this week, Giorgia Meloni spoke. She is the leader of Italy. She said everyone from China should have a COVID test. She said this only works if all of Europe does it. Many people fly to Italy. They stop in other European countries first.

Italy's health ministry said something on Thursday. Now, people from China must show a test. The test must be negative before they fly. They must also take another test when they arrive in Italy. This is an antigen test."
32,32_0,0,"Brazil has been gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepared to both welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons. Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration.","Brazil is ready for a big new year. It is a very important time for the country.

Brazil will have a new president. His name is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He will start his job on January 1st. Many people will come to see him in Brasilia. He will be president for four years.

Brazil will also say goodbye to Pelé. Pelé was a very famous football player. He died on Thursday.

Pelé's real name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento. He was 82 years old. He was sick for a long time with cancer. He was in the hospital for over a month. He died because his body stopped working.

People in Santos are very sad. Santos is the city where Pelé played football. Walter Dias is an old journalist. He knew Pelé. He said that everyone is sad. He said Pelé was like family.

Usually, funerals in Brazil happen quickly. But Pelé's family wants more time. They want all the family to come. It will be a sad goodbye.

Pelé had three wives. He had seven children and many grandchildren. Some live in Brazil. Some live in the United States. Brazil is a very big country. It is almost as big as Europe.

Many people will come to Santos. The city has almost two million people. Many news reporters will also be there.

The old president is Jair Bolsonaro. He will not go to the funeral. He will go to Florida. He will not give the president's sash to Lula.

On Friday, Bolsonaro talked to the people. He said he did not like Lula's new helpers. He also talked about a person who wanted to blow up a truck. This person supports Bolsonaro."
32,32_1,1,"That terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia, and the weekend is set to be both tense and festive – but whatever happens could be overshadowed by the following day’s events. Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides.","The news about a possible terror attack has made people in Brasilia worried. This weekend will be exciting, but also stressful. But something else is happening that might be more important.

Lula will become the new president. People from many countries will come to see him. But Pelé died, and this is important for the whole world. They are preparing a big goodbye for him, like a funeral for a leader.

Many important people sent messages. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars, and his old friends all said they were sad. Bolsonaro said the country will have three days of sadness.

Lula said Pelé made Brazil famous. People all over the world knew his name, even if they spoke a different language. They knew how to say ""Pelé.""

The president of Santos football club is very sad. Pelé played for Santos. He said people will always remember Pelé. He said Pelé is forever and will live in our hearts. Pelé came to Santos as a young boy. He became a king there. People loved him in Santos, in Brazil, and all over the world. He said, ""Pelé, rest in peace. Watch over us.""

Santos said Pelé's body is at a hospital in São Paulo. On Monday morning, they will take his body to Santos. The trip is about 50 miles. They will take him to the Vila Belmiro stadium, where he played.

People can come to the stadium to say goodbye. His body will be in the middle of the field for 24 hours. Then, on Tuesday, his family will have a private funeral.

The funeral will start at 10 am. The cars will drive through the streets of Santos. They will drive past the house where Pelé's mother lives. She is 100 years old."
32,32_2,2,"The former athlete of the century will be laid to rest at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies that claims to be the tallest in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a space on the ninth floor of the building almost two decades ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out. Pelé is loved by people here and by fans of the club because he projected the name of Santos all over the world.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

Pelé was a very famous athlete. He was the athlete of the century. He will be buried soon.

He will be buried at a special place. It is called Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica. It is a tall building. It is like a cemetery, but it is very tall. It has space for 18,000 bodies. People say it is the tallest in the world.

Pelé chose this place a long time ago. He paid for a spot on the ninth floor. This was almost twenty years ago. The newspaper O Globo wrote about it.

He wanted to be on the ninth floor. His father was a player. His father wore the number 9 shirt. That is why Pelé chose the ninth floor.

The place has a good view. You can see the Vila Belmiro stadium. Pelé chose this place because it felt peaceful. He said it felt calm. He said it did not look like a cemetery. O Globo wrote this.

Someone named Dias talked about the burial. He said many people will come. The city is getting ready. People will come to remember Pelé. People in Santos love Pelé. Fans of the club love him too. He made the city of Santos famous all over the world."
33,33_0,0,"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","In 2022, the world had problems. There was Covid and a possible war in Ukraine. But in China, life was quiet.

The leader of China, Xi Jinping, had a plan for Covid. It was called ""zero-Covid"". It seemed to work, and there were not many cases of Covid.

Sometimes, cities were locked down. People followed the rules. Xi probably wanted this quiet time as he became leader for a third time. This was a big event.

Xi wanted China to be strong. He wanted a strong economy and control over the country. He also wanted Taiwan to be part of China. He wanted China to have more power in the world.

But at the end of 2022, China had new problems. The year was not as good as Xi hoped.

There were problems with houses and money. There was trouble near Taiwan in August. Other countries put rules on China because of human rights issues. The US also made rules about China's chip industry. China's friendship with Russia was also difficult.

Xi became leader for a third time. But after some weeks, people protested in China. This was very brave. The protests seemed to stop the ""zero-Covid"" plan.

2022 was supposed to be a good year for Xi. But a China expert, Jerome Cohen, said Xi had more problems than good things to enjoy. He said China was in trouble, and people did not like Xi as much.

In October, there was a meeting. It was called the 20th party congress. Xi became leader for another five years. He is now the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

Before Xi, leaders did not want one person to have too much power. But Xi changed this. He made his ideas, called ""Xi Jinping thought"", very important. He also removed people who did not agree with him. One person removed was the former leader, Hu Jintao.

Now, Xi has a lot of power. Some people are worried. They think he might make bad choices because he is surrounded by people who always agree with him.

Professor Steve Tsang said that Xi becoming leader for a third time was the most important thing for China in 2022."
33,33_1,1,"“Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn.","Xi Jinping has a plan for China. He thinks his plan is good. But his plan may take China in a new and unknown direction.

One big part of his plan is to take over Taiwan. Taiwan is an island. Some experts do not think China will take Taiwan soon.

Last year, China's army did more things near Taiwan than ever before. In August, China said it might use force to take Taiwan.

Nancy Pelosi from the United States visited Taiwan. This made China show its power. China sent more planes and ships near Taiwan. This was more than before.

The United States helps Taiwan. The US may give Taiwan a special status like other important friends. The US is also selling weapons to Taiwan.

Ma Chun-Wei is from a university in Taiwan. He says China cannot fight the US. So, China is doing things to Taiwan and its people. China may use the internet and money to cause problems for Taiwan. This may happen before the next election in Taiwan in 2024.

Yun Sun works at a think tank. She says China will try to force Taiwan to do what it wants. This will happen as long as the Democratic Progressive party is in power in Taiwan. This party wants Taiwan to be more independent.

On Monday, Taiwan said many Chinese planes flew near the island. These planes included fighter jets and drones. This was the most planes ever seen near Taiwan in one day.

What China is doing in Taiwan is making its relationship with the West bad. China is also treating people badly in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. The United Nations said this might be a crime against people.

China and Russia have a friendship. Russia attacked Ukraine. China did not say that the attack was bad. This also made China's relationship with the West worse."
33,33_2,2,"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”. Zero-Covid restrictions and the near collapse of the property development sector punished China’s economy this year.","The war in Ukraine is a problem for Xi. It makes things hard for him in the world. He is friends with Putin, the leader of Russia. But Xi does not want problems with other countries. He does not want to be punished with rules against Russia.

China and Russia both want to be strong in Asia. They both want to control trade in that area.

America said that Putin asked China for weapons. But China did not give weapons to Russia. However, China helps Russia in other ways. China helps Russia with news and information. This news is not always true. China also tries to stop other countries from punishing Russia.

Chinese leaders said they agree with the war. The armies of China and Russia did exercises together.

Also, Chinese diplomats caused problems. In England, Chinese diplomats hit a person who was protesting. The diplomats went back to China. They did not talk to the police in England.

But Xi still wants good relationships with other countries. He talked to many leaders, including the leader of America, Joe Biden. Xi wants to make his government look better. He wants to change things after some hard actions.

Some people are worried. They think that some countries will be nice to China. They might not talk about human rights in China. Human rights are about people's freedom and safety.

But some countries are still hard on China. America is making new rules. These rules affect the computer chip business in China. Japan and the Netherlands will also join these rules. This makes it hard for Xi to make China's economy better.

These rules might hurt China's economy a lot. The rules about Covid and problems with houses in China also hurt the economy this year."
33,33_3,3,"To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone. A faltering economy could further provoke domestic frustrations, which peaked in 2022 over the impact of Xi’s signature hardline zero-Covid policy. For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled. With no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel restrictions or mass testing, Covid cases have soared across China. Mass fatalities are predicted, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

The government in China wants to help with houses that are not finished. Some houses fell down. The government will give money to start building again. They will give 1.4 trillion yuan. This is a lot of money.

Experts think this money will help builders. They can start building more houses. This will help China's economy.

But China has other problems too. The ""zero-COVID"" policy made the economy bad. The policy is now gone. More people are getting sick.

The bad economy can make people angry. In 2022, people were very angry about the ""zero-COVID"" policy. This policy was made by Xi Jinping.

For two years, the policy helped most people. They lived normal lives. Few people died from COVID. But then a new type of COVID, called Omicron, came. It spread very fast. It made the economy and people's lives bad.

People did not like the lockdowns. Lockdowns happened suddenly and were not done well. People started to protest. Some bad things happened that made people even angrier. A bus with people in quarantine crashed. A fire in a building killed people. The building was locked down.

These protests were big. They were the biggest since 1989. People were angry about the ""zero-COVID"" rules. They also did not like the government controlling what they could say. Some people did not like Xi Jinping.

The protests showed some Chinese people how the government treats some groups of people. They saw how the government treats people who are different or who disagree with the government.

One expert said that the COVID problems showed people that the government does not always follow its own rules.

The police stopped the protests quickly. But the protests seemed to change things. After one week, the ""zero-COVID"" policy was stopped. Many people thought the policy would continue for a long time.

Now there are no more lockdowns. People do not need to quarantine. People can travel. There is no more testing for everyone. But now, many people in China are getting COVID. Experts think many people will die. They think up to one million people could die from the virus."
33,33_4,4,"On Monday, in his first remarks on Covid since the shift in policy, Xi urged officials to take steps to “feasibly protect people’s lives” and said: “We should launch the patriotic health campaign in a more targeted way ... fortify a community line of defence for epidemic prevention and control, and feasibly protect people’s lives, safety and health.” Trivium says what happens next with Covid and Covid policy is “the most important question” politically and economically, for China and Xi in 2023: “It’s not at all clear how this plays out.” The past year has brought far more for China than Xi would have hoped, or analysts expected. Tsang says that, in the end, events have still largely worked out for Xi, even if protests took the shine off his leadership. “He mostly got what he wanted, including not just a third term as top leader but also a leadership filled by his supporters,” says Tsang. “It is less clear that it was equally good for China, as Xi’s amassing of near dictatorial power is costing China dearly.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin","Here is the rewritten text, following your instructions:

On Monday, Xi spoke about Covid. It was his first time talking about Covid since the policy changed. He told the officials to help people. He said to ""protect people's lives"".

He also said to start a campaign. It is about health and loving your country. The campaign should help stop Covid. It should protect people's lives, safety and health.

Trivium says Covid is very important. What happens with Covid and the rules is key. This is for China and for Xi in 2023. It is important for politics and money. It is not clear what will happen.

The last year was difficult for China. It was harder than Xi wanted. It was harder than experts thought.

Tsang said things worked out for Xi. Some people protested, but Xi is still in charge. He got what he wanted. He is the leader for a third time. He has people who support him in the government.

But it might not be good for China. Xi has a lot of power. This is costing China a lot.

34,34_0,0,"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","China is getting ready. They think more people will get COVID in the countryside. This will happen in early 2023. Now, many cities have a lot of COVID cases. Hospitals are very full.

The Lunar New Year is in January. It is a big holiday in China. People can visit their families. They could not visit for a long time. The rules were very strict. They could not travel easily.

Now, people can travel. Many workers will go home. They may bring COVID with them. The countryside does not have many hospitals. They do not have many doctors or nurses. They do not have enough tools or medicine. They do not have much money for health care.

One person wrote on WeChat. WeChat is a Chinese social media site. This person lives in a small town. They said that everyone should have the same chance to get help. But people in cities and the countryside are not equal. It is not fair when it comes to COVID. People in the countryside do not know as much about health. They do not have the same help.

A company called Airfinity thinks more people will get sick in the countryside. This will happen in late winter. It might be worse than what is happening in the cities now.

The government changed how they talk about COVID. Before, they said COVID was very dangerous. Now, they say it is like a cold.

The person on WeChat said that people in their town talk differently about COVID. They say everyone has a cold. They say there is nothing to worry about.

Because of this, the government does not tell people to stay away from each other. They do not tell people to wear masks. This could help stop the virus from spreading. It could give hospitals more time to help people.

Jeremy Wallace is a professor. He is surprised that the government is not talking about how bad things are. He thinks they should tell people to be careful. This could help the hospitals. The hospitals have too many patients."
34,34_1,1,"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","I think many people will die. This is like what happened in Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Maybe one million people will die.

In cities, the virus is spreading very fast. Experts think the virus will soon stop spreading so quickly. But it is hard to know. China stopped telling people about the virus.

China used to tell everyone about the virus numbers. But now, many people are sick and dying. The government will not tell people the number of deaths every day.

On Friday, the government said only one person died from the virus. They said 5,500 people got sick. But news stories say hospitals are full of sick people.

One company, Airfinity, thinks about 9,000 people die every day in China. They think next month, 25,000 people could die every day. They think almost two million people could die by April.

A government person said that China is not counting all the deaths from the virus. Other countries count deaths differently. In other countries, if someone dies soon after testing positive for the virus, they count it as a virus death. But China only counts deaths from breathing problems caused by the virus.

The government person said China is counting deaths like other countries.

China says they are doing a good job with the virus. They changed from strong rules to letting the virus spread. But people are talking about how bad things are on the internet.

China usually stops people from saying bad things about the government online. But now, many people are talking about the virus. These messages are staying online. This is because the government is changing the rules about what people can say. It is hard for them to stop all the messages."
